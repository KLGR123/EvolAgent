  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine the maximum length in meters of '#9' from National Geographic's first YouTube short according to Monterey Bay Aquarium website data, requiring numerical answer only. All three members faced identical challenges with direct video access and website search limitations, leading each to employ deductive reasoning approaches. Member 1 concluded 9.6 meters based on Giant Pacific Octopus arm span analysis with scoring methodology but limited verification. Member 2 reached 9.1 meters through systematic 27-file research process, also identifying Giant Pacific Octopus as the most probable candidate with strong aquarium connection reasoning. Member 3 demonstrated the most comprehensive approach: (1) systematic research of National Geographic's early YouTube patterns, (2) logical hypothesis development about countdown video formats, (3) successful access to actual Monterey Bay Aquarium content (27KB download), (4) identification of 30 feet maximum measurement, and (5) precise conversion to 9.144 meters using standard conversion factor. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on Giant Pacific Octopus identification across all members, but divergence in final measurements (9.6, 9.1, 9.144). Member 3's approach shows superior methodological rigor through actual source data collection from MBA website rather than estimation, plus proper unit conversion completion. Integration assessment: Member 3's 9.144 meters represents the most systematically derived and source-verified answer, with clear documentation of research process and mathematical precision in unit conversion from the established 30-foot measurement.",
