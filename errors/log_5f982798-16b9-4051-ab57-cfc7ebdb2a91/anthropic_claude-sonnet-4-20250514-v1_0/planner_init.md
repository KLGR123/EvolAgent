# Planner Initialization

## Task
I read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.

## Episodic Examples
### **Title:**  
Identify a society-type label shared between a 2022 AI regulation paper and a 2016 Physics and Society article on arXiv.

**TASK**: A paper about AI regulation that was originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022 shows a figure with three axes, where each axis has a label word at both ends. Which of these words is used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016?

### NASA Astronaut Group Member with Least Space Time from 2006 APOD (Jan 21) Image, August 2023

---

**Answer:**

The APOD image from January 21, 2006, shows astronauts Michael Foale (larger) and C. Michael Fincke (smaller). C. Michael Fincke was a member of NASA Astronaut Group 16 ("The Sardines").

As of August 2023, among Group 16 astronauts who have flown, **Yvonne Cagle** and **Christopher Loria** never flew in space, so they are excluded.

Of the remaining flown astronauts from Group 16, **William McCool** spent the least time in space, as he was the pilot of STS-107 (Columbia), which lasted **15 days, 22 hours, 20 minutes**.

Convert to minutes:
- 15 days × 24 hours = 360 hours
- 360 hours + 22 hours = 382 hours
- 382 hours × 60 minutes = 22,920 minutes
- 22,920 minutes + 20 minutes = **22,940 minutes**

**Final answer:**

McCool;22940

**TASK**: In NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day on 2006 January 21, two astronauts are visible, with one appearing much smaller than the other. As of August 2023, out of the astronauts in the NASA Astronaut Group that the smaller astronaut was a member of, which one spent the least time in space, and how many minutes did he spend in space, rounded to the nearest minute? Exclude any astronauts who did not spend any time in space. Give the last name of the astronaut, separated from the number of minutes by a semicolon.
