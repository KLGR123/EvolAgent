  "reason": "Task decomposition: Calculate percentage of 86 filtered penguins relative to total penguin population per Wikipedia's 2012 upper estimates, requiring five decimal place precision. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 identified 86 qualifying penguins correctly and found 32.9 million total penguins, yielding 0.00026%. Member 2 also found 86 qualifying penguins but used 28.3 million total penguins from comprehensive Wikipedia species analysis, calculating 0.00030%. Member 3 correctly identified 86 qualifying penguins but concluded Wikipedia lacked consolidated 2012 population data, suggesting only 37,400 African penguins as reliable 2012 figure. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence on penguin filtering (all found 86 qualifying penguins: 43 from Torgersen, 43 from Biscoe, excluding Dream Island residents and those with bills >42mm). Critical divergence exists in Wikipedia population research. Member 2's approach was most methodologically sound, systematically extracting data from Wikipedia's 'List of Sphenisciformes by population' page using species-specific analysis and upper bound selection for 16 species. Member 1's 32.9 million figure appears inflated and lacks detailed methodology. Member 3's conclusion that no consolidated data existed contradicts the comprehensive species list page that Member 2 successfully analyzed. Synthesis evaluation: Member 2's 28,288,779 total population represents the most rigorous Wikipedia research with proper documentation and verification. Final calculation: (86 รท 28,288,779) ร 100 = 0.0003040075%, rounded to five decimal places = 0.00030%. Quality assurance confirms this methodology aligns with task requirements for Wikipedia-based 2012 upper estimates.",
