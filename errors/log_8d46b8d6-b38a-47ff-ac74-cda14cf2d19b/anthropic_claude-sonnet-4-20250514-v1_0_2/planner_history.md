    "description": 'The PLAN has been successfully completed. The penguin filtering and population extraction task is 100% complete with comprehensive verification. \n\n**Task Completion Summary:**\n1. ✅ **CSV Data Parsed**: Successfully loaded and analyzed the penguin dataset (344 total penguins)\n2. ✅ **Filtering Criteria Applied**: Correctly implemented the dual filter:\n   - Excluded penguins living on Dream Island (124 excluded)\n   - Excluded penguins with bill lengths > 42mm (132 additional excluded)\n   - Handled missing data appropriately (2 penguins with missing bill_length_mm excluded)\n3. ✅ **Population Count Extracted**: Identified **86 qualifying penguins** that meet both criteria\n4. ✅ **Results Verified**: Cross-validated through multiple verification steps confirming data integrity\n5. ✅ **Output Files Created**: \n   - `workspace/qualifying_penguins.csv` (3,901 bytes) - Complete dataset of qualifying penguins\n   - `workspace/penguin_filtering_summary.json` (462 bytes) - Comprehensive filtering statistics\n\n**Final Result:**\n- **Population Count: 86 qualifying penguins**\n- **Breakdown**: 43 from Torgersen Island, 43 from Biscoe Island\n- **Species Composition**: 83 Adelie penguins, 3 Gentoo penguins\n- **Bill Length Range**: 33.5mm to 42.0mm (mean: 38.41mm)\n- **Criteria Verification**: 0 Dream Island penguins, 0 penguins with bill_length > 42mm\n\nThe numerator for the percentage calculation has been successfully extracted and verified. The filtering logic correctly identified penguins that do NOT live on Dream Island AND do NOT have beaks longer than 42mm, resulting in a final population count of **86 qualifying penguins**. All data integrity checks passed, confirming the accuracy of this result for subsequent percentage calculations.',

    "description": "PLAN successfully completed - Research and extraction of 2012 total penguin population upper estimates from English Wikipedia has been accomplished with comprehensive verification. The analysis extracted population data for 16 penguin species from Wikipedia's 'List of Sphenisciformes by population' page, totaling 28,288,779 individual penguins as the 2012 upper estimate. The final calculation shows that 86 qualifying penguins represent 3.04e-04% (0.0003040075%) of the total penguin population. Key achievements: (1) Successfully searched and downloaded comprehensive Wikipedia penguin population data, (2) Parsed and extracted population figures for all 16 species with estimates using species-specific regex patterns, (3) Handled population ranges by using upper bounds for maximum estimates, (4) Determined that data represents mature individuals through content analysis, (5) Calculated final percentage with manual verification confirming accuracy, (6) Saved comprehensive results to JSON format and generated detailed summary report. The methodology was thorough, using authoritative Wikipedia sources and applying proper data extraction techniques. Data quality is high with comprehensive species coverage from the definitive Wikipedia population list. All files created in workspace include: corrected_penguin_percentage_calculation.json (3,944 bytes) containing full results and methodology, corrected_penguin_percentage_summary.txt (1,442 bytes) with detailed report, and supporting analysis files. The PLAN objective has been fully achieved with the final verified answer: 3.04e-04%.",
