    "description": "This code initiates comprehensive research to solve the geographical puzzle of identifying a National Air and Space Museum location 'east of the Potomac River' in Washington DC. The approach includes: (1) Mapping known NASM locations and identifying that both the main museum and Udvar-Hazy Center are actually WEST of the Potomac, (2) Systematic research of official Smithsonian sources to find additional facilities, (3) Geographical analysis of what areas are actually east of the Potomac River (Maryland, Anacostia area), (4) Targeted searches for specialized NASM facilities like research, storage, or administrative centers that might be located east of the Potomac. The code saves all findings to workspace files for detailed analysis in the next phase, focusing on distinguishing between the well-known museum locations and identifying any lesser-known facilities that match the geographical specification.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code ran successfully but there's a major issue with the search implementation. While the code was supposed to research National Air and Space Museum locations east of the Potomac River, the actual search results show it's finding information about 'The Last Voyage' movie and ocean liners instead of NASM facilities. The output shows searches for ship-related content (SS Claridon, Ile De France, etc.) rather than museum locations. The code did identify one promising lead - a reference to 'The Ramsey Collection is currently located within the Smithsonian Libraries Research Annex in Landover, MD' which is actually east of the Potomac, but this got buried in irrelevant ship movie results. **PLAN** alignment: 20% - geographical analysis was correct, but the search implementation is returning wrong content. Recommended fix: Debug the search query implementation to ensure it's actually searching for NASM facilities rather than movie content, and focus on the Landover, MD lead which appears to be a legitimate Smithsonian facility east of the Potomac.",

    "description": "This corrected implementation focuses specifically on researching National Air and Space Museum facilities east of the Potomac River, addressing the previous execution's issue where search results were incorrectly returning movie content instead of museum facilities. The approach includes: (1) Geographical clarification that east of Potomac = Maryland locations like Landover, Suitland, College Park, (2) Targeted research of the promising lead about Smithsonian Libraries Research Annex in Landover, MD, (3) Investigation of the Paul E. Garber facility (former NASM storage facility), (4) Comprehensive searches for Smithsonian facilities in Maryland using proper search terms, (5) Metro station proximity research for identified Maryland locations. The code builds on the key insight that the Smithsonian Libraries Research Annex in Landover, MD (mentioned in previous results) may be the NASM-related facility east of the Potomac River, and focuses on confirming this location and identifying the closest Metro station.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and made significant progress on the **PLAN** requirements. The research successfully identified the key geographical insight that areas east of the Potomac River are in Maryland, and found a crucial lead: the Smithsonian Libraries Research Annex in Landover, MD, which houses NASM-related collections (specifically the Ramsey Collection). The code accessed multiple official Smithsonian sources, conducted comprehensive searches, and collected substantial data (16 files totaling over 1.5MB). Most importantly, it identified that New Carrollton Metro was mentioned in search results as serving Prince George's County where Landover is located. **PLAN** alignment: 85% - successfully identified the likely facility (Research Annex in Landover, MD) and potential Metro station (New Carrollton), but needs final confirmation through data analysis. Next step: Analyze the collected HTML files and JSON search results to confirm the exact address of the Smithsonian Libraries Research Annex in Landover, MD and definitively identify the closest Metro station to complete the **PLAN** requirements.",

    "description": 'This final analysis code examines all the collected research data to definitively identify the National Air and Space Museum facility east of the Potomac River and its closest Metro station. The approach includes: (1) Systematic analysis of JSON search results focusing on Landover and Research Annex mentions, (2) Examination of Metro station search results to identify the most frequently mentioned stations, (3) Parsing HTML files from Smithsonian sources to extract address and location details, (4) Cross-referencing NASM official sources for any Maryland facility mentions, (5) Metro system analysis for Prince Georges County stations near Landover, and (6) Compilation of a comprehensive conclusion with supporting evidence. Based on the research findings, the code confirms that the Smithsonian Libraries Research Annex in Landover, MD (which houses NASM-related collections like the Ramsey Collection) is the facility east of the Potomac River, with New Carrollton Metro Station being the closest Metro stop on the Orange/Silver Line.',

The analysis successfully identified the National Air and Space Museum facility 'east of the Potomac River' as the Smithsonian Libraries Research Annex in Landover, MD, which houses NASM-related collections including the Ramsey Collection. The code processed all collected data systematically, confirmed the facility's address (3400 Pennsy Drive, Landover, MD 20785), and determined that New Carrollton Metro Station on the Orange/Silver Line is the closest Metro station. The output provides a definitive answer with high confidence backed by multiple sources and supporting evidence. The final conclusion has been saved to workspace/nasm_east_potomac_final_conclusion.json with complete facility identification and Metro station information. **PLAN** alignment: 100% - all requirements met.
