# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Calculate the number of Metro stations between Union Station (where the person ended up after going in the wrong direction to Cleveland Elementary School) and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station (the intended destination near Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF) without changing Metro lines. Research the Washington Metro system to determine if there is a direct route between these stations on the same line, and if so, count the intermediate stations.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The developer has successfully identified all three key Metro stations - Wiehle-Reston East (starting point at National Air and Space Museum), Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (intended destination near Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF), and Union Station (wrong destination near Cleveland Elementary School), (2) We now need to determine the Metro route between Union Station (Red Line) and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (Blue/Yellow Lines) to see if there's a direct connection without changing lines, (3) Expected outcome is to either find a direct route and count the stations, or determine that no direct route exists without line changes, (4) This will provide the final numerical answer requested in the TASK about how many Metro stations away the person is from their original destination.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Identify All MBTA Franklin-Foxboro Line Stops from South Station to Windsor Gardens (May 2023)

**Description**: Search for current MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line information as of May 2023 to identify all stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens. Focus on finding official MBTA route maps, schedules, or station listings that show the complete sequence of stations on the Franklin-Foxboro line during that time period.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban planning analysis to assess public transit accessibility for proposed residential developments along the Franklin-Foxboro line
- Real-time travel app development to provide up-to-date station lists and schedules for commuters between South Station and Windsor Gardens
- Historical transit research comparing MBTA station sequences and service changes over time for transportation studies
- Automated schedule validation for third-party trip planning platforms integrating MBTA commuter rail data
- Accessibility audit for advocacy groups evaluating which Franklin-Foxboro line stops offer ADA-compliant facilities
- Corporate shuttle coordination for businesses locating offices near specific MBTA stops, requiring precise stop listings for employee commute planning
- Emergency response planning by municipal agencies to map evacuation routes and access points using the latest MBTA station data
- Tourism website content creation, ensuring accurate and current information about train stops and connections for visitors traveling to Foxboro events

### Development Step 3: Count Intermediate Stops Between South Station and Windsor Gardens on MBTA Franklin-Foxboro Line Using API Data

**Description**: Count the intermediate stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens on the MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line using the comprehensive station data already retrieved. Extract the exact number of stops that fall between these two endpoints (not including South Station and Windsor Gardens themselves) from the processed MBTA API data in the workspace files.

**Use Cases**:
- MBTA commuter rail schedule optimization for transit planners assessing passenger flow between major endpoints
- Real estate market analysis for agents highlighting properties with direct access to intermediate stops on the Franklin-Foxboro line
- Automated travel itinerary generation for tour operators planning group excursions with stop-by-stop breakdowns
- Emergency response route planning for municipal agencies needing precise intermediate station locations for evacuation scenarios
- Accessibility audits for advocacy groups evaluating the number and distribution of stops with ADA-compliant facilities between South Station and Windsor Gardens
- Data-driven marketing campaigns for local businesses targeting commuters at specific intermediate stations
- Academic transportation studies analyzing ridership patterns and station usage between urban and suburban endpoints
- Mobile app development for commuters providing real-time alerts and notifications for intermediate stops along the MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line

### Development Step 14: Largest and Smallest Washington County Seats by Land Area and 2020 Census Populations

**Description**: Identify the largest and smallest county seats by land area from the complete dataset of 39 Washington state county seats with their land area measurements. Then extract the 2020 census population data for these two specific county seats using the official data.census.gov source as specified in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- GIS-based resource allocation dashboard for Washington State Department of Health to plan rural vaccination clinics by comparing land area and population density in sprawling county seats versus compact towns
- Public transportation route optimization for Sound Transit to ensure efficient bus coverage in the largest county seat (by land area) and the smallest one, using 2020 census population figures
- Cell tower placement strategy for a telecommunications provider to maximize signal coverage in low-density, large-area county seats and high-density, small-area counterparts
- Emergency services deployment plan for the Washington State Fire Marshal’s Office, balancing response times by analyzing both land area and resident counts of the biggest and smallest county seats
- Real estate market analysis for a commercial developer evaluating potential investment in under-populated, expansive county seats versus densely settled, small-area locations
- Environmental impact assessment by the Washington Department of Ecology modeling per-capita green space availability in large-area county seats compared to compact urban centers
- Academic research by the University of Washington’s Geography Department examining correlations between county seat land area and population distribution across Washington
- State budget allocation tool for the Washington Office of Financial Management to distribute funds per capita, integrating land area size with the latest census population data

### Development Step 5: Compile Official Land Area Measurements for Washington’s 39 County Seats

**Description**: Research and extract the land area data for all 39 Washington state county seats that were identified in the previous step. Use authoritative sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, official city websites, or government geographic databases to obtain the land area measurements for each county seat city. Focus on finding the official land area figures in square miles or square kilometers for accurate comparison.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban infrastructure planning in Washington state county seats, using precise land area data to design municipal water supply networks and street maintenance schedules
- Public health service optimization across Washington county seats, mapping clinic and vaccination center coverage by city square miles for equitable access
- Emergency management resource allocation for Washington county seats, leveraging land area measurements to position fire stations and disaster response teams efficiently
- Real estate investment analysis targeting Washington county seats, correlating land area figures with property values to identify growth opportunities
- Environmental impact assessments in Washington county seats, calculating per capita green space and planning urban park development based on city land area
- Transportation network design for Washington county seats, using area statistics to model bus routes, bike lanes, and traffic flow projections
- Retail site selection and market entry strategy for chains expanding into Washington county seats, comparing city land area and population density for optimal store placement
- Educational district boundary planning in Washington county seats, utilizing land area data to balance school catchment zones and capacity planning
