    "description": "Starting comprehensive research on three Washington DC area locations to identify their closest Metro stations. This initial phase focuses on gathering official information from authoritative sources including Smithsonian websites for the Air and Space Museum, airport authority sites for the fire station, and DC Public Schools for Cleveland Elementary. The code systematically accesses multiple URLs for each location, saves HTML responses for detailed analysis, and tracks key indicators like 'metro', 'station', 'transportation', and location-specific terms. All data is being saved to workspace files for subsequent detailed parsing to extract specific addresses and Metro station proximity information.",

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed successfully and completed the initial data collection phase. The script successfully accessed 4 out of 9 target URLs (44% success rate) and saved HTML files containing relevant information about all three locations. Key findings: (1) Identified the National Air and Space Museum east of Potomac as the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA with transportation info found, (2) Located Reagan National Airport information with Metro Blue/Yellow line references for Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF, (3) Found Cleveland Elementary School data. However, the **PLAN** requires identifying specific Metro stations for each location, which hasn't been completed yet. Current output shows promising indicators but needs analysis of the saved HTML files to extract specific addresses and Metro station names. Next step: Create a follow-up script to parse the saved HTML files (museum_search_1.html, museum_search_3.html, fire_station_search_3.html, school_search_3.html) and extract specific addresses and Metro station information to complete the **PLAN** requirements.",

This phase systematically parses the saved HTML files using BeautifulSoup to identify: (1) The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA and its closest Metro access (likely Wiehle-Reston East on Silver Line), (2) Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF at Reagan National Airport and its Metro station (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Blue/Yellow lines), and (3) Cleveland Elementary School in Washington DC and its nearest Metro station. The code uses regex patterns to extract addresses, searches for Metro-related keywords, and compiles comprehensive findings into a structured JSON file for final analysis.',

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed successfully and made significant progress analyzing the HTML files collected in the previous phase. The script successfully identified 2 out of 3 Metro stations: (1) Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is clearly located at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with the Metro station 'Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport', (2) National Air and Space Museum is confirmed as Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, but the closest Metro station was not determined despite finding transportation keywords, (3) Cleveland Elementary School was confirmed in Washington, DC with address '20001' but no specific Metro station was identified. **PLAN** alignment: 66% complete - one location fully resolved, two locations need specific Metro station identification. The analysis results have been properly saved to 'workspace/metro_station_analysis.json' for reference. Next step: Perform targeted searches or use additional resources to determine the closest Metro stations for the Udvar-Hazy Center (likely involving Silver Line/Wiehle-Reston East based on Dulles area keywords) and Cleveland Elementary School (using the DC address and quadrant information found).",

This phase focuses on: (1) Researching the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center's Metro access by searching WMATA (Washington Metro) official sources for Silver Line stations, specifically identifying Wiehle-Reston East as the closest station to the Chantilly, VA location, (2) Determining the closest Metro station to Cleveland Elementary School in Washington DC 20001 by analyzing central DC Metro stations and identifying Union Station as the most likely closest station for the northeast/central DC zip code area. The code systematically searches official transportation websites, analyzes Metro system maps, and applies geographic knowledge to make informed determinations. All findings are compiled into a comprehensive final results file that provides complete answers to the PLAN requirements for all three locations and their respective closest Metro stations.",

    "description": 'Analyzing the Washington Metro system to determine if there is a direct route between Union Station (closest to Cleveland Elementary School where the person went in the wrong direction) and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station (closest to Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF, the intended destination). The code first inspects the workspace to extract the previously identified Metro stations, then researches the Washington Metro system to determine which lines serve each station. Based on Metro system knowledge, Union Station is served only by the Red Line, while Reagan National Airport is served by the Blue and Yellow Lines. Since these lines do not share any common segments, no direct route exists without changing lines. The analysis concludes that a transfer would be required, making it impossible to count intermediate stations on a single line between these two locations.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful but incorrect analysis - Code ran without errors and successfully researched Washington Metro system information, correctly identifying that Union Station serves the Red Line and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport serves Blue/Yellow Lines. However, the code contains a critical error in its Metro line analysis. The output shows the web scraping found that Union Station actually serves Red, Blue, AND Yellow Lines (as stated in 'Union Station lines found: ['Red Line', 'Blue Line', 'Yellow Line']'), but the code then incorrectly overrides this with hardcoded knowledge claiming 'Union Station lines: Red Line' only. This leads to the wrong conclusion that no direct route exists. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - the fundamental question about direct route possibility and intermediate station count is answered incorrectly due to ignoring the actual research data. The code should use the scraped data showing Union Station serves Blue/Yellow Lines, which would establish a direct route connection to Reagan National Airport. Next step: Fix the logic to use the actual research findings instead of hardcoded assumptions, then recalculate the route analysis and intermediate station count.",
