    "description": 'Starting comprehensive research on Washington DC Metro route planning between the National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac River and Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF. This initial phase focuses on: (1) Identifying the correct Air and Space Museum location east of the Potomac (likely the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA), (2) Confirming Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF location at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, (3) Gathering Metro access information for both locations, and (4) Collecting WMATA system data for route planning. The code systematically fetches official information from Smithsonian and WMATA websites, saves all content to workspace files for detailed analysis, and compiles initial findings about the two key locations and their Metro accessibility.',

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed successfully and made good progress on the research objective. The script correctly identified the National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac as the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA, and determined that Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is at Ronald Reagan National Airport. However, 2 out of 4 web requests returned 404 errors (transport info for Udvar-Hazy and DCA Metro station details), limiting the data collection. The code successfully saved 2 HTML files with useful information and created a comprehensive JSON summary. **PLAN** alignment: 60% complete - locations identified but specific Metro routing details still needed. Next steps: (1) Analyze the saved HTML files (udvar_hazy_info.html and wmata_maps.html) to extract Metro connection details, (2) Try alternative URLs for WMATA station information, (3) Research bus connections from nearest Metro station to Udvar-Hazy Center since it's in Virginia suburbs.",

The script successfully analyzed all previously collected data, conducted additional research attempts (though some URLs returned 404s), and produced a complete Metro route mapping. The code correctly identified that the National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac is the Steven F.

    "description": 'Starting comprehensive research to identify the Metro station closest to Cleveland Elementary School in the Washington DC area and analyze the Silver Line route scenario. This initial phase: (1) Searches DC Public Schools and GreatSchools databases for Cleveland Elementary School locations and addresses, (2) Investigates potential Metro stations that could serve the school area, focusing on Columbia Heights (Green Line) and U Street-Cardozo (Green/Yellow Lines) as likely candidates, (3) Researches Silver Line route maps and station information, (4) Begins analysis of the routing problem where someone took the wrong direction from Silver Line toward National Airport. The code systematically collects data from official sources, saves all content to workspace files for detailed analysis, and establishes the foundation for determining the specific Metro station, wrong direction taken, and station count calculations needed to complete the PLAN objectives.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and made excellent progress on the **PLAN** requirements. The script successfully identified Cleveland Elementary School at 1825 8th Street NW Washington DC through DCPS database research, and correctly determined that Columbia Heights Metro (Green Line) is the closest station. The code also established key facts about the Silver Line route and confirmed that National Airport is served by Blue/Yellow lines (not Silver Line). However, the **PLAN** requires calculating the specific number of stations from the wrong direction to National Airport, which wasn't completed. **PLAN** alignment: 75% complete. Next steps: (1) Analyze the saved HTML files to determine the exact closest Metro station to Cleveland Elementary, (2) Map the Silver Line route to identify specific wrong direction stations, (3) Calculate the station count from the wrong direction point to National Airport via required transfers. The comprehensive research foundation has been established - now need the specific station counting analysis.",
