    "description": 'Starting comprehensive research on Washington DC Metro route planning between the National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac River and Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF. This initial phase focuses on: (1) Identifying the correct Air and Space Museum location east of the Potomac (likely the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA), (2) Confirming Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF location at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, (3) Gathering Metro access information for both locations, and (4) Collecting WMATA system data for route planning. The code systematically fetches official information from Smithsonian and WMATA websites, saves all content to workspace files for detailed analysis, and compiles initial findings about the two key locations and their Metro accessibility.',

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed successfully and made good progress on the research objective. The script correctly identified the National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac as the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA, and determined that Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is at Ronald Reagan National Airport. However, 2 out of 4 web requests returned 404 errors (transport info for Udvar-Hazy and DCA Metro station details), limiting the data collection. The code successfully saved 2 HTML files with useful information and created a comprehensive JSON summary. **PLAN** alignment: 60% complete - locations identified but specific Metro routing details still needed. Next steps: (1) Analyze the saved HTML files (udvar_hazy_info.html and wmata_maps.html) to extract Metro connection details, (2) Try alternative URLs for WMATA station information, (3) Research bus connections from nearest Metro station to Udvar-Hazy Center since it's in Virginia suburbs.",

The script successfully analyzed all previously collected data, conducted additional research attempts (though some URLs returned 404s), and produced a complete Metro route mapping. The code correctly identified that the National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac is the Steven F.
