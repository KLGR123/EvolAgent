# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Identify which Metro station is closest to Cleveland Elementary School in the Washington DC area, then determine the wrong direction the person took from the Silver Line route. Calculate how many stations they are from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station without changing lines, considering they went the wrong direction from their intended eastbound journey to downtown DC.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The developer successfully mapped the correct route from Udvar-Hazy Center requiring eastbound Silver Line travel toward downtown DC, then transfer to Blue/Yellow Line southbound to Reagan National Airport, (2) We now need to identify where someone would end up if they went westbound instead of eastbound on the Silver Line and find the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School, (3) Expected outcome is to determine the specific Metro station near Cleveland Elementary School and count the number of stations between that location and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport without changing lines, (4) This will provide the final numerical answer for how far they are from their original destination Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Identify All MBTA Franklin-Foxboro Line Stops from South Station to Windsor Gardens (May 2023)

**Description**: Search for current MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line information as of May 2023 to identify all stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens. Focus on finding official MBTA route maps, schedules, or station listings that show the complete sequence of stations on the Franklin-Foxboro line during that time period.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban planning analysis to assess public transit accessibility for proposed residential developments along the Franklin-Foxboro line
- Real-time travel app development to provide up-to-date station lists and schedules for commuters between South Station and Windsor Gardens
- Historical transit research comparing MBTA station sequences and service changes over time for transportation studies
- Automated schedule validation for third-party trip planning platforms integrating MBTA commuter rail data
- Accessibility audit for advocacy groups evaluating which Franklin-Foxboro line stops offer ADA-compliant facilities
- Corporate shuttle coordination for businesses locating offices near specific MBTA stops, requiring precise stop listings for employee commute planning
- Emergency response planning by municipal agencies to map evacuation routes and access points using the latest MBTA station data
- Tourism website content creation, ensuring accurate and current information about train stops and connections for visitors traveling to Foxboro events

### Development Step 14: Largest and Smallest Washington County Seats by Land Area and 2020 Census Populations

**Description**: Identify the largest and smallest county seats by land area from the complete dataset of 39 Washington state county seats with their land area measurements. Then extract the 2020 census population data for these two specific county seats using the official data.census.gov source as specified in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- GIS-based resource allocation dashboard for Washington State Department of Health to plan rural vaccination clinics by comparing land area and population density in sprawling county seats versus compact towns
- Public transportation route optimization for Sound Transit to ensure efficient bus coverage in the largest county seat (by land area) and the smallest one, using 2020 census population figures
- Cell tower placement strategy for a telecommunications provider to maximize signal coverage in low-density, large-area county seats and high-density, small-area counterparts
- Emergency services deployment plan for the Washington State Fire Marshal’s Office, balancing response times by analyzing both land area and resident counts of the biggest and smallest county seats
- Real estate market analysis for a commercial developer evaluating potential investment in under-populated, expansive county seats versus densely settled, small-area locations
- Environmental impact assessment by the Washington Department of Ecology modeling per-capita green space availability in large-area county seats compared to compact urban centers
- Academic research by the University of Washington’s Geography Department examining correlations between county seat land area and population distribution across Washington
- State budget allocation tool for the Washington Office of Financial Management to distribute funds per capita, integrating land area size with the latest census population data

### Development Step 16: Determine Largest and Smallest Washington County Seats by Area and Retrieve Their 2020 Census Populations

**Description**: Identify the largest and smallest county seats by land area from the complete dataset of 39 Washington state county seats with their land area measurements. Then extract the 2020 census population data for these two specific county seats using the official data.census.gov source as specified in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban planning and zoning optimization for county commissions using land‐area extremes and 2020 census population data to prioritize infrastructure projects in Washington’s smallest and largest county seats
- Real estate investment analysis by brokerage firms comparing population density in the geographically smallest versus largest Washington county seats to identify emerging housing markets
- Emergency management resource allocation for the Washington State Department of Emergency Services, balancing response strategies between sprawling rural county seats and compact urban ones based on land area and census figures
- Environmental impact assessment by conservation NGOs evaluating human footprint in the most expansive and most confined county seats to guide habitat protection initiatives
- Healthcare facility network design for public health agencies, determining optimal clinic placement by correlating geographic size with population in Washington’s extreme county seats
- Tourism development planning by regional travel boards tailoring visitor experiences to the demographic and spatial profiles of the smallest and largest county seats
- Transportation infrastructure feasibility studies by the Washington State Department of Transportation, modeling transit options in low‐density, high‐area versus high‐density, low‐area county seats using extracted census data
- Academic urban studies research at universities investigating the relationship between land area and population dynamics in Washington’s smallest and largest county seats for peer‐reviewed publication

### Development Step 19: Sort birth cities from presidential_birthplaces.json records with minimum and maximum longitudes

**Description**: Identify the records in workspace/presidential_birthplaces.json with the minimum longitude and the maximum longitude, extract their birth_city values, sort those two city names alphabetically, and output them as a comma-separated list.

**Use Cases**:
- Identifying the westernmost and easternmost presidential birth cities to generate an interactive U.S. history road-trip planner featuring state travel tips
- Automating quality assurance in a government GIS dataset by flagging records with extreme longitude values for manual verification
- Powering an educational app module that quizzes students on the geography of presidential birthplaces by highlighting the two farthest apart cities
- Generating a dynamic map overlay for a political news website that marks the easternmost and westernmost birth locations of U.S. presidents
- Enriching a travel blog’s “Presidential Routes” section by automatically extracting and alphabetically sorting the extreme-longitude birth cities
- Supporting a demographic research project that analyzes geographic dispersion of presidential birthplaces by isolating boundary cases
- Integrating into a civic-education chatbot to quickly answer “Which president was born farthest west or east?” by fetching and sorting birth city names
