  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine metro station distance from wrong destination (Cleveland Elementary School area) to intended destination (Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF) without changing lines in 2022 Washington DC Metro system. Member 1 conducted systematic location identification: National Air and Space Museum east of Potomac = Udvar-Hazy Center (served by Silver Line stations), Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF = Reagan National Airport Metro Station (Blue/Yellow Lines), Cleveland Elementary School = Cleveland Park Metro Station (Red Line). Calculated 13 stations total via Blue Line route from Reagan Airport to Cleveland Park, but noted transfer requirement at Metro Center. Member 2 performed similar research with different Cleveland Elementary identification: located school in DC central area near Union Station (Red Line). Found Union Station serves Blue/Yellow/Red Lines, enabling direct Blue Line connection to Reagan Airport with 13 intermediate stations. Member 3 identified Cleveland Elementary at Shaw-Howard U station but incorrectly focused on Silver Line wrong-direction scenario rather than the actual wrong destination. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on 13-station distance between Reagan Airport and Cleveland-area stations. Divergence stems from Cleveland Elementary School location identification - Member 2's Union Station proximity is most geographically consistent with DC school naming patterns and provides direct Blue/Yellow Line connectivity. Member 1's Cleveland Park identification also viable but requires Red Line transfer. Integration assessment: Member 2's approach demonstrates strongest methodological rigor with comprehensive route verification and direct-line connectivity confirmation. Final validation: 13 intermediate stations on Blue Line between Union Station and Reagan National Airport represents most reliable answer.",
