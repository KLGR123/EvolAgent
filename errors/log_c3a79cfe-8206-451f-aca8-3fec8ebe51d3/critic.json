  "reason": "Task decomposition: The problem requires identifying (1) the National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac River and its Metro station, (2) Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF location and its Metro station, (3) Cleveland Elementary School's closest Metro station, and (4) counting stations between the wrong destination and intended destination without line changes. Individual solution evaluation: Member 1 identified the museum as Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport (Silver Line) but concluded 0 stations due to line transfer requirements, showing methodological rigor but misinterpreting the constraint. Member 2 identified the museum as Smithsonian Libraries Research Annex in Landover, MD (New Carrollton/Orange Line) and calculated 10 stations via Yellow Line, demonstrating systematic research but incorrect museum identification. Member 3 correctly identified the museum as Udvar-Hazy Center (Innovation Center/Silver Line), located Cleveland Elementary near Shaw-Howard University (Yellow Line), and calculated 7 stations to Reagan Airport via Yellow Line without transfers. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF being at Reagan National Airport, but divergence on museum location and Metro connections. Critical evaluation: Member 3's approach demonstrates superior geographical accuracy by correctly identifying the Udvar-Hazy Center as the only National Air and Space Museum facility definitively east of the Potomac River, while Member 2's Landover location lacks clear NASM designation. Member 3's solution path via Yellow Line connection provides the most direct interpretation of 'without changing lines' by utilizing the Yellow Line's service to both Cleveland Elementary area and Reagan Airport. Validation confirms 7 stations between Shaw-Howard University and Reagan National Airport on Yellow Line: Mount Vernon Square, Gallery Place-Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, Pentagon, Pentagon City, Crystal City.",
