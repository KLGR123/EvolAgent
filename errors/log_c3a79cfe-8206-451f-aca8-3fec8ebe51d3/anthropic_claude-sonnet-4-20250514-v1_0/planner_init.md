# Planner Initialization

## Task
The year is 2022. I am at the National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac River. I want to go to Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF using the metro. I go in the wrong direction and end up at the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School. How many metro stations am I away from my original destination if I don't change lines? Your answer should be a numerical integer value.
