    "description": "This implementation conducts comprehensive research to identify the National Air and Space Museum location east of the Potomac River in Washington DC. The approach uses multiple research phases: (1) Direct access to official Smithsonian Air and Space Museum websites to gather location information, addresses, and visitor details, (2) Google Search API queries targeting specific location and Metro station information, (3) Systematic analysis of collected data to identify location patterns and Metro access points. The code searches for key indicators like 'Udvar-Hazy', 'Chantilly', 'Virginia', and Metro station references across all sources. Based on geographical knowledge that the National Mall (main museum) is west of the Potomac, the research focuses on identifying the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia as the likely candidate for the museum 'east of the Potomac River'. The implementation saves all HTML content, extracted text, and search results to workspace files for detailed analysis, then compiles findings into a comprehensive research summary with conclusions about the specific museum location and nearest Metro station access.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code appears to have a significant bug where it's executing a completely different task than intended. The **PLAN** requires researching National Air and Space Museum locations east of the Potomac River and finding Metro stations, but the **CURRENT CODE OUTPUT** shows the script searching for 'Eva Draconis websites' and analyzing 'curved line symbols in banners' instead. This is a fundamental mismatch between the code logic and the stated objective. The code did successfully access some Smithsonian museum websites and extracted valuable location data (finding Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA with address 14390 Air and Space Museum Parkway), but then diverted to an unrelated Eva Draconis search task. **PLAN** alignment: 30% - partial museum data collected but wrong task executed. Immediate fix needed: Remove the Eva Draconis search logic and focus the code exclusively on analyzing the successfully collected Air and Space Museum location data to complete the original research objective.",

    "description": "This implementation analyzes the successfully collected museum data from the previous research phase to complete the original objective. The code inspects the museum location text files that were saved to the workspace, extracting key information about addresses, location indicators, and Metro station details. It systematically searches for patterns indicating the Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, counts mentions of key location terms (Chantilly, Udvar-Hazy, Virginia, Dulles), and identifies specific addresses like '14390 Air and Space Museum Parkway'. The analysis confirms that the Steven F.
