    "description": 'This implementation conducts comprehensive research to identify the locations and metro stations for both the National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac River and Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF. The code uses multiple research approaches including Wikipedia searches and official sources to establish that: (1) The National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac is the Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA near Dulles Airport, which requires a bus connection from the Silver Line, and (2) Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is located at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which has direct Metro access via Blue and Yellow Lines. The research establishes the starting point (Reagan Airport) and destination (Udvar-Hazy Center) for the metro journey, saving all findings to workspace/dc_metro_station_research.json with supporting HTML files for detailed analysis. This provides the foundation for planning the specific metro route in subsequent steps.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements perfectly. The script successfully identified both target locations: (1) National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac River is the Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA, served by Silver Line stations (Wiehle-Reston East, Reston Town Center, Herndon) with bus connection required, and (2) Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is located at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, VA, directly served by the 'Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport' station on Blue and Yellow Lines. The code produced comprehensive research results with proper location identification, metro station mapping, and feasibility analysis. All findings are saved to 'workspace/dc_metro_station_research.json' with supporting HTML files for reference. The **PLAN** objective has been fully achieved - both starting point (Reagan Airport Metro Station) and destination (Silver Line stations + bus to Udvar-Hazy) are clearly established for the metro journey planning.

    "description": 'This implementation inspects and analyzes the research results from the previous step to extract and summarize the key location and metro station information. The code first examines the JSON file structure to understand the data format, then extracts the critical details about both locations: (1) Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is confirmed to be at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with direct access via Blue and Yellow Line metro stations, and (2) The National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac is the Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA, which requires Silver Line access plus a bus connection. The analysis creates a comprehensive summary showing this is a multi-modal journey requiring a metro transfer from Blue/Yellow Lines to Silver Line, followed by a bus connection to reach the final destination. This establishes the foundation for detailed route planning in the next phase.',

The script successfully processed the existing research data and extracted all key location and metro station information. The code clearly identified: (1) Starting point: Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, served by 'Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport' station on Blue and Yellow Lines with direct access, and (2) Destination: National Air and Space Museum (Udvar-Hazy Center) in Chantilly, VA, requiring Silver Line stations (Wiehle-Reston East, Reston Town Center, Herndon) plus bus connection. The analysis produced a comprehensive summary showing the multi-modal journey requirements (Metro + bus) and saved results to 'workspace/metro_journey_summary.json'. The **PLAN** objective has been fully achieved - both the starting metro station and destination metro stations are clearly established. The code also properly identified that this is a complex journey requiring transfer from Blue/Yellow Lines to Silver Line, then bus connection to the final destination.
