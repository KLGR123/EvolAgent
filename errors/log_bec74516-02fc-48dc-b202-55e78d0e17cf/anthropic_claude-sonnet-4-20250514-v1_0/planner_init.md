### Identify the Secret Santa Who Did Not Give a Gift in a Twelve-Person Exchange

**TASK**: An office held a Secret Santa gift exchange where each of its twelve employees was assigned one other employee in the group to present with a gift. Each employee filled out a profile including three likes or hobbies. On the day of the gift exchange, only eleven gifts were given, each one specific to one of the recipient's interests.
