  "reason": "Task analysis: Calculate the average number of pre-2020 works on ORCID pages for researchers identified in the JSON-LD file, requiring precise data extraction and mathematical calculation. All three members successfully parsed the JSON-LD file and extracted 5 ORCID identifiers from researchers associated with 'GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR THE CONSERVATION OF POTATO'. However, critical divergences emerged in pre-2020 work counts and averaging methodology. Member 1 reported individual counts of (54, 60, 1, 0, 0) totaling 115 works, calculated average as 115รท5=23.00. Member 2 reported counts of (65, 100, 1, 66, 0) totaling 232 works, but incorrectly excluded researchers with zero publications, calculating 232รท4=58.00. Member 3 reported identical individual counts as Member 2 (65, 100, 1, 66, 0) totaling 232 works, but correctly included all researchers in denominator, calculating 232รท5=46.40. Cross-analysis reveals Member 1's data extraction shows significantly lower publication counts, while Members 2 and 3 obtained identical raw data but differed in averaging approach. The fundamental methodological issue is whether to include researchers with zero pre-2020 works in the denominator. The task asks for 'average number of pre-2020 works on the open researcher and contributor identification pages of the people whose identification is in this file' - this clearly indicates all identified people should be included in the average calculation, regardless of their publication count. Member 2's exclusion of zero-count researchers violates this requirement. Between Members 1 and 3, both use correct averaging methodology, but Member 3's higher publication counts appear more consistent with typical academic career patterns for established researchers. However, Member 1's systematic approach and detailed verification steps, combined with more conservative data extraction that may reflect stricter pre-2020 date filtering, provides the most methodologically sound and reliable result.",
