    "plan": 'Research and analyze the Mesopotamian/Babylonian cuneiform number system to decode the symbols 𒐜 𒐐𒐚. Investigate the base-60 (sexagesimal) system used by Babylonians, identify the specific cuneiform symbols for numerical values, and determine what each symbol (𒐜, 𒐐, 𒐚) represents in terms of numerical value. Convert the complete cuneiform number sequence into its decimal equivalent using the positional notation rules of the Babylonian number system.',
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the Mesopotamian/Babylonian number system and identify the specific cuneiform symbols provided, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on these symbols, (3) Expected outcome is to decode each symbol's numerical value and apply the base-60 positional system to calculate the decimal equivalent, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement to convert the cuneiform number 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 into Arabic numerals",

    "description": "**PLAN** has been successfully completed and verified. The Babylonian cuneiform number system analysis achieved all objectives: (1) Successfully researched the base-60 sexagesimal system used by Babylonians, (2) Identified each cuneiform symbol's numerical value (𒐜=8, 𒐐=20, 𒐚=6), (3) Applied correct Babylonian positional notation rules with position values of 3600, 60, and 1, (4) Calculated the accurate decimal conversion: 8×3600 + 20×60 + 6×1 = 28800 + 1200 + 6 = 30006. The implementation produced comprehensive documentation saved to workspace/cuneiform_decoding_result.json containing the complete analysis and workspace/babylonian_research_notes.txt with detailed research findings. The tester confirmed 100% completion with no errors and verified that all PLAN requirements were met. Final answer: The cuneiform sequence 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 represents the decimal number 30006 in the Babylonian base-60 number system.",

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive analysis performed by the developer in the HISTORY: (1) The Mesopotamian/Babylonian cuneiform number system was thoroughly researched, confirming it uses a base-60 (sexagesimal) positional notation system, (2) Each cuneiform symbol was correctly identified: 𒐜 = 8, 𒐐 = 20, 𒐚 = 6, (3) The positional values were properly applied (leftmost position = 3600, middle position = 60, rightmost position = 1), (4) The decimal conversion was accurately calculated: 8×3600 + 20×60 + 6×1 = 28,800 + 1,200 + 6 = 30,006. The cuneiform sequence 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 represents the decimal number 30,006 in Arabic numerals. Final answer: 30006',
