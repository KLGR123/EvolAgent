# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Calculate the standard population deviation of the red numbers and the standard sample deviation of the green numbers using Python's statistics module, then compute the average of these two values and round the result to three decimal places as specified in the TASK.

## Description
This is the final calculation step because: (1) We have successfully extracted the red numbers (31 values) and green numbers (18 values) from the image analysis, (2) The TASK requires calculating standard population deviation for red numbers and standard sample deviation for green numbers using Python 3.11's statistics module, (3) Expected outcome is to compute statistics.pstdev() for red numbers, statistics.stdev() for green numbers, take their average, and round to three decimal places, (4) This completes the TASK by providing the final numerical answer as requested

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Analyze Python code file to understand logic, trace execution, and find its final numeric output.

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Python code file data/gaia/2023/validation/f918266a-b3e0-4914-865d-4faa564f1aef.py to understand its structure and logic. Read the complete code content, identify the main execution flow, trace through any calculations or operations, and determine what the final numeric output will be when this code is executed.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated security auditing of financial services Python scripts to detect unexpected exception paths and harmful random value usages before deployment
- Integration into a CI/CD pipeline for e-commerce microservices to trace code flow changes and prevent regressions in discount calculation logic
- Pre-release validation of healthcare analytics tools, ensuring that data sampling routines (randomized values) meet compliance criteria and don’t silently fail
- Educational platform feature that step-by-step parses student-submitted Python assignments, highlighting execution flow and exception handling for teaching programming concepts
- Quality assurance automation in IoT firmware code, analyzing logic paths that generate sensor threshold alerts to catch misconfigurations early
- Documentation generator for enterprise DevOps teams that reads source files, maps function and class structures, and produces human-readable execution overviews
- Research lab tool to validate stochastic simulation scripts by tracing random number generation criteria and logging first valid outcomes for reproducibility
- Government software compliance verifier that parses public sector codebases, traces exception-raising conditions, and produces audit-ready reports of code logic paths

### Development Step 14: Estimating False Positive Papers in Nature’s 2020 Publications Using a 4% Type-I Error Rate

**Description**: Calculate the number of statistically incorrect papers using the false positive rate principle. Given that Nature published 1,002 research articles in 2020, all assumed to rely on statistical significance with an average p-value of 0.04, determine how many would be incorrectly claiming statistical significance. Apply the concept that a p-value of 0.04 means there's a 4% chance of a false positive (Type I error) when the null hypothesis is true. Calculate 1,002 × 0.04 and round up to the next integer as specified in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic journal editorial board uses the calculation to estimate how many cancer-biology papers published in 2020 may be falsely claiming novel biomarkers, guiding more rigorous peer‐review standards
- Pharmaceutical R&D risk assessment team applies the false-positive rate principle to their preclinical efficacy studies to predict the number of drug candidates likely to fail in Phase II trials due to statistical flukes
- Regulatory agency (e.g., FDA) implements the solution to audit submitted clinical trial reports and estimate how many efficacy claims could be Type I errors before approving new therapies
- Grant review panels at a national science foundation use the calculation on past proposal outcomes to gauge the prevalence of spurious pilot‐study results informing funding decisions
- Meta-analysis researchers in cognitive psychology apply the method across hundreds of published studies to quantify the expected proportion of false positives influencing overall effect‐size estimates
- Science journalists at a major media outlet leverage the approach to flag press releases from high-impact journals that might overstate findings due to Type I errors, streamlining fact-checking workflows
- University research integrity office employs the calculation to monitor departmental publication quality, identifying fields with unusually high false-positive rates for targeted statistical training

### Development Step 15: Identify Washington County Seats with Largest and Smallest Land Areas and Their 2020 Census Populations

**Description**: Identify the largest and smallest county seats by land area from the complete dataset of 39 Washington state county seats with their land area measurements. Then extract the 2020 census population data for these two specific county seats using the official data.census.gov source as specified in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban planning and zoning standardization: compare the largest and smallest county seats by land area and 2020 population to set minimum service coverage benchmarks across Washington counties
- Real estate investment analysis: analyze population density in the smallest land-area county seat versus the largest to identify high-growth, undervalued development opportunities
- Emergency response optimization: model ambulance and fire station placement by contrasting travel times and resource needs in the most expansive and most compact county seats
- Environmental impact and conservation planning: assess undeveloped land proportions in the largest county seat against population pressure in the smallest to prioritize habitat protection projects
- GIS dashboard automation for state agencies: build a data pipeline that extracts area extremes and census populations monthly to update interactive public maps
- Academic demographic research: conduct comparative studies on land-use efficiency and population distribution between the largest and smallest county seats for peer-reviewed journals
- Logistics network design for distributors: use area-to-population ratios of the extreme county seats to optimize warehouse siting and last-mile delivery routes
- Public health resource allocation: model hospital bed and vaccination clinic requirements based on population density differences in the largest versus smallest county seats

### Development Step 14: Check START Cell’s Two-Cell Cardinal Neighbors’ Display Text and Hex Fill Colors

**Description**: Inspect workspace/grid_data.json entries for the four cardinal two-cell neighbor coordinates of the START cell by locating the coordinates (start_x±2, start_y) and (start_x, start_y±2) based on the recorded START position in workspace/start_end_coordinates.json; report each neighbor’s displayed text and 6-digit hex fill color to verify which moves from START are actually legal.

**Use Cases**:
- Autonomous warehouse navigation and rack clearance verification, checking two-bin-away grid cells from the forklift’s start position to ensure safe travel paths.
- Robotics competition maze solver, evaluating two-step cardinal moves from the entry cell to identify viable corridors and wall-free zones for path planning.
- Board game AI for a custom “two-square” mover piece, scanning cells at (x±2, y) and (x, y±2) to validate legal moves and color-coded threat areas.
- Pharmaceutical high-throughput screening grid analysis, extracting assay well labels and hex color readouts two wells away from a control sample.
- GIS-based wildfire spread modeling, sampling vegetation density and hex-coded risk levels at two-cell offsets from current fire-start coordinates.
- Pixel-art editing tool that reports text labels and 6-digit hex fill colors of pixels exactly two units away from a selected start pixel for precise color transformations.
- Automated aerial drone flight planner over farmland plots, verifying crop health indicators and color-coded NDVI values at two-field offsets from the launch point.
