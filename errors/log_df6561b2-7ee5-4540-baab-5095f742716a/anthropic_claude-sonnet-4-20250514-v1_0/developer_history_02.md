    "description": 'This implementation uses GPT-4o Vision API to analyze the attached image and extract all red and green numbers. The approach: (1) Loads and encodes the image file for API processing, (2) Sends a detailed prompt to GPT-4o requesting systematic identification of red and green colored numbers, (3) Processes the API response to extract structured data about found numbers, (4) Saves both the complete analysis and a structured summary to workspace files. The code includes comprehensive error handling, file validation, and detailed progress reporting. This is the initial step to identify all colored numbers in the image using advanced vision capabilities.',

The GPT-4o Vision API successfully analyzed the image and identified 31 red numbers and 18 green numbers with their specific positions and values. The code properly distinguished between red and green colored numbers as required, providing detailed location information for each number found. Output files were correctly saved to workspace including both the complete analysis (red_green_numbers_analysis.txt) and structured summary (red_green_numbers_summary.json). The PLAN objective of using optical character recognition and image analysis techniques to extract and distinguish red vs green numbers has been fully achieved. No further development is needed - the implementation successfully extracted all visible red and green numbers from the image with proper color identification and positioning data.',

The implementation successfully used optical character recognition and image analysis techniques to accurately capture numerical values while distinguishing between red-colored and green-colored numbers based on their visual appearance. No further development is needed as the task is complete.',

The approach: (1) Inspects the workspace directory structure to understand available files, (2) Examines the JSON summary file structure before parsing to understand data format, (3) Extracts numerical values from the text descriptions using regex patterns to handle different formats, (4) Validates the extracted counts against expected values (31 red, 18 green), (5) Uses statistics.pstdev() for red numbers population standard deviation and statistics.stdev() for green numbers sample standard deviation, (6) Calculates the average of both values and rounds to 3 decimal places as specified. The code includes comprehensive error handling, alternative extraction methods, and saves detailed calculation results to workspace for verification.",
