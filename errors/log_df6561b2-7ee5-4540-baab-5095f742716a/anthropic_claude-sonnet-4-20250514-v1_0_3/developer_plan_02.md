# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Calculate the standard population deviation of the red numbers and the standard sample deviation of the green numbers using Python's statistics module, then compute the average of these two values and round the result to three decimal places.

## Description
This is the final calculation step because: (1) We have successfully extracted all red numbers [24, 74, 28, 54, 73, 33, 64, 73, 60, 53, 59, 40, 65, 76, 48, 34, 62, 70, 31, 24, 51, 38, 55, 78, 76, 41, 77, 51] and green numbers [39, 29, 28, 72, 68, 47, 64, 74, 72, 40, 75, 26, 27, 37, 31, 55, 44, 64, 65, 46, 66, 35, 76, 61, 53, 49] from the image analysis, (2) We need to use statistics.pstdev() for population standard deviation of red numbers and statistics.stdev() for sample standard deviation of green numbers as specified in the TASK, (3) Expected outcome is to calculate both deviations, take their average, and round to three decimal places, (4) This completes the TASK by providing the final numerical answer as requested

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Analyze Python code file to understand logic, trace execution, and find its final numeric output.

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Python code file data/gaia/2023/validation/f918266a-b3e0-4914-865d-4faa564f1aef.py to understand its structure and logic. Read the complete code content, identify the main execution flow, trace through any calculations or operations, and determine what the final numeric output will be when this code is executed.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated security auditing of financial services Python scripts to detect unexpected exception paths and harmful random value usages before deployment
- Integration into a CI/CD pipeline for e-commerce microservices to trace code flow changes and prevent regressions in discount calculation logic
- Pre-release validation of healthcare analytics tools, ensuring that data sampling routines (randomized values) meet compliance criteria and don’t silently fail
- Educational platform feature that step-by-step parses student-submitted Python assignments, highlighting execution flow and exception handling for teaching programming concepts
- Quality assurance automation in IoT firmware code, analyzing logic paths that generate sensor threshold alerts to catch misconfigurations early
- Documentation generator for enterprise DevOps teams that reads source files, maps function and class structures, and produces human-readable execution overviews
- Research lab tool to validate stochastic simulation scripts by tracing random number generation criteria and logging first valid outcomes for reproducibility
- Government software compliance verifier that parses public sector codebases, traces exception-raising conditions, and produces audit-ready reports of code logic paths

### Development Step 4: Find oldest closed ‘Regression’ issue in numpy.polynomial and record its label addition time

**Description**: Search GitHub for numpy.polynomial issues to identify all closed issues that have the 'Regression' label. Focus on finding the oldest closed issue with this label and determine when the 'Regression' label was added to that specific issue. Use GitHub's issue search functionality with filters for repository 'numpy/numpy', path 'polynomial', status 'closed', and label 'Regression'. Extract the issue creation date, closure date, and label addition timestamp for the oldest matching issue.

**Use Cases**:
- Legacy codebase performance tracking in a financial software firm to identify and timestamp regressions in numerical computations after major releases
- Automated monitoring in a scientific research group analyzing regression bug introduction and triage times in community libraries like numpy.polynomial to optimize development workflows
- QA audit workflow in a biotech company tracking the first occurrence and labeling date of computational inaccuracies in polynomial fitting modules for regulatory compliance
- Open source community health dashboard for foundation maintainers to visualize historical regression labeling trends and resolution times in core numerical libraries
- DevOps incident response system auto-generating alerts when new regression issues appear in polynomial routines, capturing creation and label addition timestamps for SLA management
- Academic study on software engineering practices examining the latency between issue reporting and regression labeling in large-scale scientific computing repositories
- Product engineering team in an aerospace simulation project auditing third-party library stability by retrieving and analyzing the earliest regression issues and labeling events in polynomial modules

### Development Step 5: Find oldest closed numpy.polynomial Regression issue and its label-addition time

**Description**: Search GitHub for numpy.polynomial issues to identify all closed issues that have the 'Regression' label. Focus on finding the oldest closed issue with this label and determine when the 'Regression' label was added to that specific issue. Use GitHub's issue search functionality with filters for repository 'numpy/numpy', path 'polynomial', status 'closed', and label 'Regression'. Extract the issue creation date, closure date, and label addition timestamp for the oldest matching issue.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic research teams auditing the history of polynomial-related regressions in NumPy to validate the stability of scientific computation methods before citing them in a journal publication
- Software quality assurance engineers automating the extraction of “Regression” label addition timestamps for polynomial modules to measure and improve bug-fix turnaround times in each release cycle
- Data science teams monitoring changes and regressions in NumPy’s polynomial functions to ensure consistency and reproducibility of machine learning model fitting pipelines
- DevOps engineers integrating this GitHub search script into CI/CD workflows to automatically flag new closed regression issues in the polynomial path and prevent regressions from reaching production
- Product managers generating dashboards on closed regression issues for NumPy’s polynomial subpackage to inform road-mapping decisions and resource allocation for maintenance work
- Open-source project maintainers analyzing label-addition timelines on polynomial regression issues to benchmark community response times and prioritize high-impact bug fixes
- Compliance officers in finance or healthcare auditing the lifecycle of critical regression bugs in numerical libraries for regulatory reporting and software validation documentation
- Software educators creating case studies on real-world issue management by tracing the oldest closed regression issues in NumPy’s polynomial module and illustrating best practices in bug triage
