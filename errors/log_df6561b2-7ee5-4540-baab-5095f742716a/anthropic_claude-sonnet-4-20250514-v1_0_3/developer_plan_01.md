# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/df6561b2-7ee5-4540-baab-5095f742716a.png to identify and extract all red-colored numbers and green-colored numbers. Use image processing techniques to detect the different colored numbers, extract their numerical values, and organize them into separate lists for subsequent statistical analysis.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to examine the image to identify and extract the red and green numbers before performing any statistical calculations, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this image file, (3) Expected outcome is to have two separate lists of numbers - one for red numbers and one for green numbers - ready for statistical analysis, (4) This provides the foundation needed to calculate the standard population deviation of red numbers and standard sample deviation of green numbers using Python's statistics module

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Excel Grid Parsing: Record Cell Coordinates, Text, Fill Colors, Identify START and END Cells

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx to extract the complete grid structure: record for each cell its row–column coordinate, displayed text, and fill color as a 6-digit hex code, then identify the coordinates of the cell containing 'START' and the cell containing 'END'.

**Use Cases**:
- Project timeline extraction for construction management: parse a color-coded Gantt chart in Excel to import each task’s grid position, label, and scheduling colors, then automatically locate the “START” kickoff milestone and “END” completion point.
- Retail shelf planogram automation: extract the full store shelving grid with product names and color-coded stock levels from an Excel layout, identify the beginning (“START”) and end (“END”) of each aisle for dynamic planogram updates.
- AGV navigation map generation in manufacturing: read an Excel-based factory floor grid with zones highlighted by fill color, output precise coordinates for every cell, and locate the “START” docking station and “END” delivery bay for autonomous guided vehicles.
- Classroom seating performance analysis: parse a teacher’s Excel seating chart where student names and test scores are color-coded, record each desk’s coordinates and find designated “START” and “END” rows for group activities arrangement.
- Game level prototyping: convert a level design represented in Excel cells (with obstacles and power-ups color-coded) into JSON; pinpoint the “START” spawn cell and “END” exit cell for rapid engine import.
- Real estate floorplan digitization: extract room labels, dimensions, and color-coded zones (e.g., living, kitchen, bedrooms) from an Excel blueprint, capturing each cell’s coordinates and fill color, then identify the main “START” entrance and emergency “END” exits.
- High-throughput screening data mapping in biotech: interpret a microtiter plate layout from Excel, record each well’s row–column address, sample identifier, and color-coded assay result, and locate the “START” reference well and “END” control well for automated analysis.

### Development Step 2: Parse Excel File for Cell Coordinates, Text, Fill Colors, and ‘START’/‘END’ Locations

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx to extract the complete grid structure: record for each cell its row–column coordinate, displayed text, and fill color as a 6-digit hex code, then identify the coordinates of the cell containing 'START' and the cell containing 'END'.

**Use Cases**:
- Warehouse AGV route optimization and automated navigation using Excel grid layouts; extract cell coordinates, fill colors for storage zones, and identify START (loading bay) and END (docking station)
- Video game level map ingestion and design automation by parsing Excel-based tile grids, reading cell colors for terrain types, and locating START/END spawn points

- Research experiment plate map analysis for high-throughput screening; extract cell coordinates and reagent status colors, then pinpoint START and END wells for liquid handling robots
- Event seating arrangement and attendee flow mapping by parsing color-coded Excel seating charts; extract seat coordinates and colors for zones, identifying START (entry gate) and END (exit gate) points

- Automated validation of data integrity in migration projects by extracting and verifying URLs encoded within image-based Python scripts
- Cybersecurity incident investigation by decoding suspicious URL patterns embedded in code screenshots recovered from compromised machines
- Educational tool for teaching reverse engineering and code analysis, allowing students to extract and interpret logic from image-based scripts
- Legal e-discovery workflows where evidence is stored as screenshots of code, enabling analysts to reconstruct and analyze hidden web links
- Automated monitoring of competitor website changes by extracting and following reconstructed archive URLs from shared code snippets
- Digital forensics for recovering lost or deleted web resources by analyzing image files containing code that encodes access URLs
- Compliance auditing in regulated industries by extracting and verifying reference links from image-based documentation containing Python scripts
