  "final_answer": "Penguin",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the specific bird species featured in BBC Earth's YouTube video 'Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments', requiring accurate video identification and content analysis. All three members successfully located the target BBC Earth video (URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Njmx-UuU3M) and reached unanimous consensus on the answer. Member 1 conducted efficient metadata analysis, identifying 'the tenacious penguin' explicitly mentioned in the video description - demonstrated clear, direct approach with reliable source verification. Member 2 employed similar metadata analysis methodology, confirming the same penguin reference while also researching additional potential bird species for comprehensive coverage - showed thorough analytical thinking. Member 3 implemented the most sophisticated approach, combining textual analysis with computer vision frame-by-frame examination of video content, achieving 42.9% bird detection rate across analyzed frames and validating findings through alternative BBC Earth content - demonstrated highest technical rigor and multi-modal verification. Convergence analysis: Perfect agreement across all members on 'Penguin' as the answer, with consistent identification of the same textual evidence source. No contradictions detected between approaches. Cross-validation through Member 3's visual analysis confirms textual findings. Integration assessment: All methodologies are sound and complementary, with Member 3's approach providing strongest validation through dual verification methods. Final answer 'Penguin' is supported by explicit textual evidence, visual content analysis, and unanimous team consensus with high confidence level.",
