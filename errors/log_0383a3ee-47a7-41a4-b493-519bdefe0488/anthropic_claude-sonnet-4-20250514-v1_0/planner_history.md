    "plan": "Search for the BBC Earth YouTube video titled 'Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments' and analyze its content to identify any bird species featured in the video. Use web search queries like 'BBC Earth Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments YouTube', 'site:youtube.com BBC Earth silliest animal moments', and 'BBC Earth funny animal compilation bird species'. Access the video content, examine it systematically throughout its duration to detect and identify any bird species that appear, and document the specific bird species featured in this compilation.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate the specific BBC Earth YouTube video about silly animal moments to analyze its content, (2) No previous research has been conducted based on the empty HISTORY, (3) Expected outcome is to find and access the video to examine what animal species, particularly birds, are featured, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK of identifying the bird species in this specific BBC Earth video compilation.',
