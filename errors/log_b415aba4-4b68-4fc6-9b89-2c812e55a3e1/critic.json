  "final_answer": "quantum dots",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the nano-compound studied in the single Scientific Reports 2012 conference proceedings article that does not mention plasmons or plasmonics, with instructions to remove any 'nano' prefix. All three members executed identical systematic approaches: (1) Located Nature's Scientific Reports 2012 conference proceedings collection containing exactly 4 articles, (2) Analyzed each article for plasmon/plasmonic content, (3) Identified 3 articles with plasmon mentions (5-188 occurrences) and 1 article with zero mentions, (4) Confirmed the target article as 'Diamond photonic crystal slab: Leaky modes and modified photoluminescence emission of surface-deposited quantum dots'. Convergence analysis shows perfect agreement across all members on article identification and methodology. Member evaluation reveals: Member 1 provided comprehensive statistical analysis (21 diamond mentions, 6 quantum dot mentions) but concluded with 'diamond' as primary compound. Member 2 identified multiple compounds (photonic crystals, quantum dots, diamond, silicon) but gave ambiguous final answer mentioning both photonic crystals and quantum dots. Member 3 conducted detailed frequency analysis (9 quantum dot mentions, 6 nanocrystal mentions, 16 nano-structure mentions) and definitively concluded 'quantum dots'. Cross-analysis of the article content confirms it studies quantum dots deposited on diamond photonic crystal surfaces, with quantum dots being the active nanomaterial being investigated for photoluminescence properties. The diamond serves as the substrate/platform rather than the compound being studied. Integration assessment: Member 3's analysis most accurately identifies the research focus on quantum dots as the nano-compound under investigation, supported by the article's emphasis on quantum dot photoluminescence behavior. Final validation confirms quantum dots as the correct answer.",
