### 2011 Publisher of Lithium Salt Calcination and Acidithiobacillus Two-Stage Bioleaching Recovery Process

**TASK**: In 2011, which publisher published a work covering a process that recovers nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals from spent automotive catalysts using calcination with lithium salts, and detailing a two-stage bioleaching method employing Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans targeting low-grade cobalt ores?
