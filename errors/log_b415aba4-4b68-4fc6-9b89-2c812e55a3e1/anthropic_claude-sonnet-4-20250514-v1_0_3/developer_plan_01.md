# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for Nature journal's Scientific Reports conference proceedings from 2012 to identify all articles published in that collection. Focus on locating the specific conference proceedings section or special issue from 2012, then analyze each article to determine which ones mention plasmons or plasmonics and identify the one article that does not contain these terms. Extract information about the nano-compound studied in that specific article.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate the specific Scientific Reports conference proceedings from 2012 to establish the scope of articles to analyze, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the 2012 conference proceedings and identify all articles within that collection, (4) This establishes the foundation for systematically examining each article to find the one without plasmon/plasmonic mentions and determine what nano-compound it studies

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Total Peer-Reviewed Research Articles Published by Nature Journal in 2020

**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic library research output tracking and annual reporting for institutional reviews
- Pharmaceutical R&D intelligence gathering by monitoring Nature’s 2020 publications for competitor drug discovery trends
- Grant agency compliance verification through automated counting of peer-reviewed articles by funded investigators in 2020
- Systematic review and meta-analysis support for epidemiologists collecting and filtering Nature 2020 research studies
- University department KPI dashboard automation to report faculty publication counts in top-tier journals like Nature
- Science policy analysis of publication trends in Nature 2020 to inform government funding allocations
- Biotech marketing campaign planning by extracting Nature 2020 article data containing key technology keywords

### Development Step 5: Total Peer-Reviewed Research Articles Published by Nature Journal in 2020

**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Use Cases**:
- University research office benchmarking annual publication output by counting peer-reviewed Nature research articles from 2020 to assess departmental performance
- Pharmaceutical R&D intelligence team extracting the total number of Nature 2020 immunology papers to prioritize drug discovery projects
- Funding agency audit unit verifying grantees met their 2020 deliverable of publishing in Nature by tallying approved research articles
- Biotech market analysis group monitoring Nature’s 2020 research volume in genomics to inform competitive positioning and investor pitches
- Academic library automation workflow updating catalog records by identifying and importing all 2020 Nature journal research publications
- Science newsroom editorial planning compiling “Top Breakthroughs of 2020” from Nature by filtering and ranking the year’s key research papers
- Intellectual property analysts mapping novel technologies by surveying all 2020 Nature research articles for patent landscaping
- Environmental NGO policy team quantifying 2020 Nature biodiversity studies to support evidence-based conservation advocacy

### Development Step 1: Total number of Nature journal’s peer-reviewed research articles published in 2020

**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Use Cases**:
- University research office compiling annual publication metrics for performance review and grant reporting
- Academic librarians analyzing Nature’s 2020 research output to negotiate subscription licenses and budget allocations
- Meta-analysis researchers quantifying publication trends in high-impact journals for bibliometric studies
- Science journalists aggregating peer-reviewed article counts for end-of-year coverage on Nature’s scientific impact
- Data scientists integrating Nature 2020 research article statistics into institutional dashboards for strategic planning
- Grant administrators verifying peer-reviewed publication counts to support funding proposals and renewal dossiers
- Library consortia benchmarking Nature’s research output against competing journals to inform collection development decisions

### Development Step 12: Count of Nature Journal Peer-Reviewed Research Articles Published in 2020

**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Use Cases**:
- Pharmaceutical R&D portfolio reporting: automatically extracting and counting peer-reviewed clinical trial articles published in 2020 from major journal archives to track pipeline progress
- Banking compliance audit: parsing financial regulator websites to tally mandatory circulars and exclude advisory notices, generating compliance metrics for internal audit teams
- IT vulnerability management: scanning vendor release‐note archives to count security patch announcements issued over the past year, supporting risk assessment dashboards
- Government transparency portal: aggregating and counting policy white papers published by various ministries in 2020—excluding opinion pieces—for public data visualizations
- Tech product performance tracking: extracting performance benchmark reports from corporate blog archives to quantify improvements across hardware releases
- Nonprofit impact reporting: mining donor-facing portals to count grant award announcements in 2020 while filtering out event news for annual impact statements
- Academic department benchmarking: collecting research article counts by discipline from university publication records to support annual faculty performance reviews
