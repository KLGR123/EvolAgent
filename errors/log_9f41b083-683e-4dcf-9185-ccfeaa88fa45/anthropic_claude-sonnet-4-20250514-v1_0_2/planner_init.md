### Estimating Number of False-Positive Nature 2020 Papers with Mean p-Value of 0.04

**TASK**: If we assume all articles published by Nature in 2020 (articles, only, not book reviews/columns, etc) relied on statistical significance to justify their findings and they on average came to a p-value of 0.04, how many papers would be incorrect as to their claims of statistical significance? Round the value up to the next integer.

Accessed Nature journal's official 2020 research articles archive\n2. Downloaded and analyzed archive content from multiple Nature journal pages\n3. Performed pattern matching to identify article count indicators\n4. Verified filters confirmed research articles only (type=article parameter)\n5. Cross-referenced findings across multiple archive files\n6.
