    "description": "Initiating comprehensive search for the specific 2023 IPCC report that is 85 pages long. This implementation uses SerpAPI to execute 12 targeted search queries covering various angles: direct page count searches, official IPCC site searches, synthesis report searches, and AR6 references. The approach systematically collects results, analyzes them for relevance using a scoring system based on key indicators (IPCC mention, 2023 year, official website, PDF format, 85-page reference), and identifies the most promising candidates. Results are saved to workspace/ for further analysis. The search strategy covers both specific queries for '85 pages' and broader IPCC 2023 searches to ensure comprehensive coverage, as the IPCC published multiple reports in 2023 and we need to locate the exact 85-page version.",

Key findings include: (1) Multiple search results specifically mention 'AR6 Synthesis Report: Climate Change 2023' as being 85 pages, (2) Official IPCC sources were found at ipcc.ch with direct PDF links, (3) The code identified the correct document as 'IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf' available at the official IPCC website.

    "description": "Implementing direct download of the confirmed 85-page IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report from 2023. Based on the comprehensive search results from the previous step, we identified the target document as 'IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf' available at the official IPCC website. This implementation: (1) Downloads the PDF directly from https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf, (2) Uses proper headers to mimic browser requests for reliable access, (3) Implements streaming download with progress tracking for large files, (4) Verifies file integrity and creates comprehensive metadata, (5) Saves the document to workspace/ with descriptive filename for nuclear energy analysis. The approach ensures we have the correct 85-page 2023 IPCC report ready for the next phase of searching for nuclear energy mentions and policy discussions.",
