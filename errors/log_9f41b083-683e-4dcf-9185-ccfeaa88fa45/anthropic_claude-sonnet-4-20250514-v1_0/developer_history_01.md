    "description": "Initial search phase to identify the specific 85-page IPCC 2023 report. This implementation uses SerpAPI to execute 8 targeted search queries designed to locate IPCC publications from 2023 with exactly 85 pages. The approach prioritizes official IPCC sources (ipcc.ch) and looks for key indicators like '85 pages', 'PDF', and '2023'. Results are analyzed with a comprehensive relevance scoring system that weighs factors like official source status, page count mentions, and publication year. All search results are saved to workspace for further analysis, and top candidates are identified for the next phase where we'll verify page counts and download the correct report. The search strategy covers various IPCC report types including synthesis reports, working group reports, and summaries for policymakers to ensure we capture the specific 85-page document mentioned in the TASK.",

    "description": "This implementation completes the PLAN by downloading the identified 85-page IPCC 2023 report. Based on the tester feedback confirming that the IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report 'Longer Report' is exactly 85 pages and available at the official IPCC URL, this code directly downloads the PDF from https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf. The approach includes: (1) Proper HTTP headers to ensure successful download from the official IPCC server, (2) Progress tracking during download with file size monitoring, (3) File integrity verification comparing downloaded size with expected size, (4) Comprehensive metadata creation documenting the report details, download process, and task context, and (5) Complete workspace summary showing all created files. The code handles potential network issues with appropriate error handling and timeout management. Upon successful completion, the 85-page IPCC 2023 report will be saved to workspace with full verification, ready for the subsequent nuclear energy analysis phase. This directly fulfills the PLAN requirements to search for, identify, and download the specific 85-page IPCC report from 2023.",

The approach systematically: (1) Inspects the workspace to locate the downloaded IPCC PDF and associated metadata files, (2) Uses LangChain's PyPDFLoader to parse the entire 85-page PDF document into individual pages, (3) Conducts comprehensive nuclear energy search using 16 nuclear-related terms with regex word boundary matching to avoid false positives, (4) Extracts contextual information (150 characters before/after) for each nuclear mention to understand usage, (5) Provides detailed statistical analysis including term frequency, page distribution, and percentage coverage, (6) Saves comprehensive results to JSON for documentation and further reference. The search covers terms like 'nuclear', 'nuclear energy', 'nuclear power', 'fission', 'uranium', 'radioactive', etc. to ensure complete coverage of nuclear energy references. Results include exact page numbers, context snippets, and frequency analysis to provide a thorough assessment of how nuclear energy is discussed in the IPCC 2023 report. This directly addresses the TASK requirement to analyze nuclear energy mentions in the specific 85-page IPCC report from 2023.",
