    "plan": "Access the Ben & Jerry's online flavor graveyard website to locate and analyze the collection of discontinued flavors. Identify which flavor is designated as the 'oldest flavor' in their graveyard, then examine the photo of that flavor's headstone to find the background headstone that contains a rhyme under its flavor name. Extract the complete rhyme text and identify the last line.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to navigate to Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard to understand the layout and identify the oldest flavor, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this specific website or graveyard collection, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the oldest flavor's headstone photo and identify the background headstone with the rhyme, (4) This establishes the foundation for finding the specific last line of the rhyme as requested in the TASK",
