Navigate to the Ben & Jerry's website or official flavor graveyard section, locate information about discontinued flavors, and determine which flavor is considered the oldest. Then examine the photo of that oldest flavor's headstone to identify any other headstones visible in the background.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate Ben & Jerry's official online flavor graveyard and understand its structure to find the oldest flavor, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this specific website or flavor information, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the Ben & Jerry's flavor graveyard website and determine which flavor is considered the oldest based on their records as of end of 2022, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to examine the photo of the oldest flavor's headstone and identify background headstones with rhymes as requested in the TASK",

    "description": 'The PLAN objective has been successfully completed. I have:\n\n✓ **Located Ben & Jerry\'s flavor graveyard**: Successfully found and accessed information about the official Ben & Jerry\'s flavor graveyard through alternative sources (Atlas Obscura and Quirky Travel Guy) after the direct website was blocked.\n\n✓ **Identified the oldest flavor**: Through corrected year extraction analysis, I determined that **Dastardly Mash (1979-1991)** is the oldest flavor in the graveyard, starting in 1979.\n\n✓ **Found the oldest flavor\'s headstone**: Using GPT-4o vision analysis on downloaded graveyard images, I successfully located the Dastardly Mash headstone in image #2 (ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-800x533.jpg). The headstone was found in the middle of the image, in front of a person wearing a yellow jacket, with clearly readable text showing "Dastardly Mash 1979-1991".\n\n✓ **Examined background headstones**: The GPT-4o analysis identified **4 background headstones** visible behind the Dastardly Mash headstone:\n   1. **Peanut Butter and Jelly** (back row left side)\n   2. **Vermonty Python** (left back row)\n   3. **The Full Vermonty** (middle back row)\n   4. **Turvy** (center back row)\n\n✓ **Additional headstones in the same photo**: The analysis also identified 4 other headstones in the foreground and sides:\n   - Chocolate Comfort (1999)\n   - Econoline (1989-1990)\n   - Purple Passion Fruit (1998-2003)\n   - Plus the main Dastardly Mash headstone\n\n**Final Results**: The comprehensive analysis found a total of 8 visible headstones in the photo containing Dastardly Mash, with 4 specifically identified as background headstones. All analysis results, downloaded images, and detailed findings have been saved to workspace files including:\n- ben_jerry_headstone_analysis_final.json (comprehensive results)\n- Individual analysis files for each examined image\n- ben_jerry_oldest_flavor_corrected_analysis.json (oldest flavor identification)\n- Downloaded graveyard images for reference\n\nThe PLAN has been fully executed with detailed documentation of both the oldest flavor\'s headstone location and the specific background headstones visible in its photograph.',
