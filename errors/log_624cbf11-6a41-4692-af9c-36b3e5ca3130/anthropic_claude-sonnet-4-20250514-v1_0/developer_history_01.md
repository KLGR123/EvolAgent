The code includes extensive print statements to track progress and error handling for network issues. If the direct website access fails, it falls back to Google search using SerpAPI. All extracted content (HTML, text, analysis data) is saved to workspace/ for subsequent examination of headstone photos and background details.",

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed without errors and successfully accessed 2 alternative graveyard sources (Atlas Obscura and Quirky Travel Guy) after Ben & Jerry's official site remained blocked. The code collected valuable data including 36 headstone images and flavor information with years. However, there's a critical issue with the year extraction: the regex pattern '(19|20)\\d{2}' only captured the first two digits ('19', '20') instead of full 4-digit years, making the 'oldest year: 19' result meaningless. **PLAN** alignment: 60% complete - we have graveyard data and headstone images, but cannot properly identify the oldest flavor due to the year parsing error. The code found specific mentions like 'Fresh Georgia Peach (1986-1991)' and 'Dastardly Mash (1979-1991)' in the text, suggesting 1979 might be the actual oldest year. Next step: Fix the regex pattern to capture full 4-digit years (r'\\b(19|20)\\d{2}\\b') and re-analyze the saved text files to properly identify the oldest flavor and its corresponding headstone image.",

I'm: (1) First inspecting the saved text files to understand their structure, (2) Using a corrected regex pattern `r'\\b(19\\d{2}|20\\d{2})\\b'` to capture complete 4-digit years, (3) Extracting flavor entries with the pattern `Flavor Name (YYYY-YYYY)` to identify specific flavors and their date ranges, (4) Sorting all flavors by start year to find the absolute oldest, (5) Cross-referencing with the saved headstone images to find photos of the oldest flavor's headstone, (6) Providing specific recommendations for which headstone image to examine for background details. This corrected approach should properly identify flavors like 'Dastardly Mash (1979-1991)' as the oldest and locate its corresponding headstone photo for background examination.",

The regex pattern was fixed to capture full 4-digit years, and the analysis properly identified **Dastardly Mash (1979-1991)** as the oldest flavor in Ben & Jerry's graveyard, starting in 1979. The code found 88 total flavors and 36 headstone images from the saved text files. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - we have located the graveyard, identified the oldest flavor, and have access to headstone images. However, no direct image match was found for 'Dastardly Mash' specifically. The code identified several general graveyard overview images that could contain the oldest flavor's headstone. The comprehensive analysis has been saved to 'ben_jerry_oldest_flavor_corrected_analysis.json' with all findings. Next step: Examine the general graveyard images (particularly the ones marked as 'POTENTIAL GRAVEYARD OVERVIEW IMAGE') to locate Dastardly Mash's headstone and identify any other headstones visible in the background of that photo.",

The GPT-4o analysis will thoroughly examine each image for foreground, background, and side headstones, providing detailed information about what other flavors' headstones are visible behind or around the oldest flavor's headstone.",
