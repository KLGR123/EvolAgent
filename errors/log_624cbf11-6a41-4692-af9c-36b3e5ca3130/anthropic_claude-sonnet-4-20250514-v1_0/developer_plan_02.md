# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Examine the photo of the Dastardly Mash headstone (the oldest flavor from 1979) that was identified in the previous analysis to read the complete rhymes on each of the 4 background headstones (Peanut Butter and Jelly, Vermonty Python, The Full Vermonty, and Turvy). Extract the full text of each rhyme and identify which headstone has a flavor name, then determine the last line of the rhyme under that specific flavor name as requested in the TASK.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The previous analysis successfully identified Dastardly Mash as the oldest flavor and located 4 background headstones in its photo, but we need to read the actual rhymes on those headstones to find the one with a flavor name and extract its last line, (2) We have the specific image file (ben-jerrys-flavor-graveyard-800x533.jpg) containing the Dastardly Mash headstone with the 4 background headstones visible, (3) Expected outcome is to extract the complete text of the rhymes on the background headstones and identify the last line of the rhyme under the flavor name as specified in the TASK, (4) This directly completes the assignment by providing the specific text requested from the background headstone's rhyme

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 7: Solve an anagram to reveal a famous 100-letter line from Shakespeare’s Hamlet using all letters once.

**Description**: Solve the anagram by rearranging the letters from 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten' to find the original Shakespeare line from Hamlet that this phrase represents. Focus on identifying one of Shakespeare's most well-known lines from the tragedy, ensuring all 100 letters are used exactly once in the rearrangement.

**Use Cases**:
- Literary scholarship: Verifying the authenticity of Shakespearean quotations in academic research by matching anagrams to original text.
- Educational technology: Creating interactive classroom puzzles where students solve anagrams to learn famous literary lines.
- Digital humanities: Automating the identification and reconstruction of scrambled literary passages for corpus analysis projects.
- Museum exhibit design: Generating engaging displays that challenge visitors to decode anagrams of iconic quotes using systematic algorithms.
- Publishing workflow: Ensuring accurate reproduction of classic texts by cross-checking anagrammed promotional material against the source.
- Game development: Integrating advanced anagram solvers into word-based puzzle games featuring historical literature.
- Copyright and plagiarism detection: Analyzing reworded or disguised Shakespearean content to confirm proper attribution in digital media.
- Archival restoration: Reconstructing damaged or incomplete manuscripts by matching letter frequencies to known literary works.

### Development Step 8: Solve an anagram to reveal a famous 100-letter line from Shakespeare's Hamlet.

**Description**: Solve the anagram by rearranging the letters from 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten' to find the original Shakespeare line from Hamlet that this phrase represents. Focus on identifying one of Shakespeare's most well-known lines from the tragedy, ensuring all 100 letters are used exactly once in the rearrangement.

**Use Cases**:
- University literature professors creating challenging anagram-based assessments to test students’ knowledge of classic texts and critical thinking skills
- Escape room designers incorporating complex literary anagram puzzles that require solvers to reconstruct famous quotes for game progression
- Digital humanities researchers verifying the authenticity of historical manuscripts by matching scrambled or fragmented text to canonical literary sources
- Automated grading systems for online Shakespeare courses that check student-submitted anagram solutions against original play lines for accuracy
- Educational app developers building interactive games where users solve anagrams to unlock famous passages from classic literature
- Publishers and editors using automated tools to detect and reconstruct misprinted or jumbled lines in digitized versions of public domain works
- Trivia competition organizers generating unique, high-difficulty questions by scrambling iconic literary quotes for contestants to solve
- Museum curators designing interactive exhibits where visitors unscramble anagrams to reveal and learn about significant literary quotations

### Development Step 9: Title: Unscramble Anagram to Reveal Famous Hamlet Line Using All 100 Letters Exactly Once

**Description**: Solve the anagram by rearranging the letters from 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten' to find the original Shakespeare line from Hamlet that this phrase represents. Focus on identifying one of Shakespeare's most well-known lines from the tragedy, ensuring all 100 letters are used exactly once in the rearrangement.

**Use Cases**:
- University literature professor designing an automated quiz system that generates anagram puzzles from classic texts for student engagement and assessment
- Digital humanities researcher verifying the authenticity of historical Shakespeare quotations using letter frequency analysis and anagram solving
- Escape room game designer creating challenging literary puzzles that require participants to reconstruct famous lines from scrambled clues
- Educational technology developer building an interactive app where students solve anagrams to learn about Shakespearean language and context
- Publishing house editor checking for plagiarism or unauthorized text modifications in submitted manuscripts by comparing letter distributions of famous quotes
- AI-powered chatbot for museums or cultural institutions, providing visitors with interactive Shakespeare trivia based on anagram decoding
- Forensic linguist analyzing ransom notes or anonymous letters for hidden references to classic literature using strategic anagram matching
- Automated grading tool for creative writing assignments, validating that student-generated anagrams accurately reconstruct the original literary source

### Development Step 12: Solve an anagram to reveal a famous 100-letter line from Shakespeare’s Hamlet.

**Description**: Solve the anagram by rearranging the letters from 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten' to find the original Shakespeare line from Hamlet that this phrase represents. Focus on identifying one of Shakespeare's most well-known lines from the tragedy, ensuring all 100 letters are used exactly once in the rearrangement.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated grading of literature quizzes by verifying student solutions to Shakespearean anagram challenges
- Digital humanities research for reconstructing original texts from cryptic literary puzzles in historical archives
- Educational game development where players solve famous literary anagrams to unlock new levels or content
- Museum exhibit interactive kiosks that allow visitors to unscramble classic lines from Shakespeare using touchscreens
- Plagiarism detection in academic writing by matching rearranged text to canonical Shakespeare passages
- Content moderation tools for online forums that identify and flag disguised quotations from copyrighted works
- AI-powered chatbot assistants for English teachers that generate and validate anagram-based homework assignments
- Archival restoration projects that use letter frequency analysis to reconstruct damaged or incomplete Shakespeare manuscripts
