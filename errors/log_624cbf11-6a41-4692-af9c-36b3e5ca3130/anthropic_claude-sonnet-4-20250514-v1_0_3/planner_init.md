### Title:  
Calculate % Difference from US Standard Butterfat in Ice Cream Using 2020 Wikipedia Data

**TASK**: If this whole pint is made up of ice cream, how many percent above or below the US federal standards for butterfat content is it when using the standards as reported by Wikipedia in 2020? Answer as + or - a number rounded to one decimal place. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/b2c257e0-3ad7-4f05-b8e3-d9da973be36e.jpg
