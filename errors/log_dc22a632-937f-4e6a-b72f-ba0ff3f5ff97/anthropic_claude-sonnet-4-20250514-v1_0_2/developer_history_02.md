The searches cover: (1) General Ali Khan TV show and budget food content, (2) Specific 'Cheap Eats' show search with New Mexico focus, (3) New Mexican cuisine episodes and restaurants, (4) James Beard Award winners restaurant book connection. Each search result is saved to workspace for detailed analysis. This systematic approach will help identify the show name, format, specific New Mexico episodes, and the restaurant that was later recommended by James Beard Award winners in a book.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed comprehensive searches for Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show. The searches successfully identified the show as 'Cheap Eats' which started in 2015 on Cooking Channel, and found key information including a specific New Mexico episode (Albuquerque - Season 1, Episode 3) and restaurant mentions (Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant and Cree-Mee Drive). All four search results were properly saved to workspace JSON files. The output reveals important findings: the show format (Ali Khan visits cities with $35 budget for meals), specific New Mexico locations (Albuquerque episode, Cimarron restaurant), and restaurant details (Papa Felipe's with sopaipilla stuffed with carne, Cree-Mee Drive with green/red chile). However, the James Beard Award winners book connection wasn't clearly established in the search results. **PLAN** alignment: 80% complete - show identification and New Mexico episodes found, but the specific restaurant recommended by James Beard Award winners needs further investigation. Next step: Analyze the saved JSON files more deeply to extract specific episode details and search more specifically for the James Beard Award winners restaurant book connection.",

First inspecting the JSON file structures to understand their format, then systematically extracting key details including: (1) Show identification - 'Cheap Eats' starting 2015 on Cooking Channel, (2) New Mexico episodes - Albuquerque Season 1 Episode 3, (3) Specific restaurants visited - Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant and Cree-Mee Drive with their featured dishes and locations, (4) Show format details - $35 budget per city. Compiling all findings into a structured summary and identifying that the James Beard Award winners book connection still needs further investigation.

The script successfully extracted and compiled key information about Ali Khan's show 'Cheap Eats' (started 2015 on Cooking Channel), identified the Albuquerque episode (Season 1, Episode 3), and found two New Mexico restaurants: Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant (featuring sopaipilla stuffed with carne) and Cree-Mee Drive in Cimarron (featuring green/red chile and strawberry shake). The analysis properly structured the findings and saved them to 'ali_khan_compiled_findings.json'. However, the James Beard Award winners book connection remains unidentified - the search4 results didn't contain clear connections between the restaurants Ali Khan visited and any James Beard Award winners' book recommendations. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - show name, format, New Mexico episodes and restaurants are identified, but the crucial James Beard Award connection is missing. Next step: Conduct more targeted searches specifically for James Beard Award winners who wrote restaurant recommendation books that mention either Papa Felipe's or Cree-Mee Drive, or search for New Mexico restaurant guidebooks by James Beard Award winners.",

This directly answers the **PLAN** requirement to identify which restaurant Ali Khan visited that was later recommended by two James Beard Award winners in a book. The code also properly reviewed existing compiled findings showing the complete picture: Show = 'Cheap Eats' (2015, Cooking Channel), New Mexico restaurants = Papa Felipe's (Albuquerque) and Cree-Mee Drive (Cimarron), and now the James Beard connection = Jane and Michael Stern's 2009 publication recommending Papa Felipe's. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - all major requirements identified except need to confirm the specific book title. The searches were properly saved to workspace files for reference.

The searches focus on: (1) Direct search for Jane and Michael Stern's 2009 book with Papa Felipe's mention, (2) Their restaurant guidebooks from 2009 with New Mexico focus, (3) General search for their 2009 publications with restaurant recommendations, (4) Site-specific search of the source that mentioned their 2009 publication. This systematic approach should help identify the complete book title as requested in the PLAN. Also checking existing workspace files to understand any previous research context.

The searches were properly saved to workspace files and the output shows some promising results, particularly from Search 1 which found the nmgastronome.com source mentioning 'In 2009, James Beard Award-winning food journalists Jane and Michael Stern published a terrific...' However, the code output was truncated and didn't complete all four searches or show the full analysis. The searches appear to have found the key connection between Jane and Michael Stern's 2009 publication and Papa Felipe's restaurant, but the specific complete book title (with numbers in plain text format as requested) was not extracted from the results. **PLAN** alignment: 70% complete - the James Beard Award winners (Jane and Michael Stern) and publication year (2009) are confirmed, and the Papa Felipe's connection is established, but the exact book title still needs to be extracted.

Using pattern matching to look for common book title indicators like 'published a', 'wrote a', 'book titled', and quoted text that might contain the title.

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed a comprehensive analysis of existing search results to identify the specific book title by Jane and Michael Stern. The analysis successfully found the crucial information: Jane and Michael Stern published a book in 2009 that recommended Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant. From the search results, particularly in Clue 11 from stern_book_search2.json, the code extracted a key pattern showing 'published a terrific tome entitled 500 Things to Eat'. This appears to be the book title we're looking for - '500 Things to Eat Before It's Too Late' by Jane and Michael Stern, published in 2009. The analysis properly examined multiple search files, used pattern matching to extract potential book titles, and identified the connection between the 2009 publication and Papa Felipe's recommendation. However, the complete title extraction could be clearer and the numbers should be converted to plain text format as requested. **PLAN** alignment: 90% complete - the book appears to be identified as '500 Things to Eat Before It's Too Late' but needs confirmation and plain text number conversion (Five Hundred Things to Eat Before It's Too Late). Next step: Confirm this is the correct complete title and format it with numbers in plain text as specified in the plan requirements.",
