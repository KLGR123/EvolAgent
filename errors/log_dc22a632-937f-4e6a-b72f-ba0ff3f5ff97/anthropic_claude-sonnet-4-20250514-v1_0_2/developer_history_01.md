Each search result is saved to workspace for detailed analysis. This systematic approach will help identify the show name, format, specific New Mexico episodes, and the restaurant that was later recommended by James Beard Award winners in a book.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed comprehensive searches for Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show. The searches successfully identified the show as 'Cheap Eats' which started in 2015 on Cooking Channel, and found key information including a specific New Mexico episode (Albuquerque - Season 1, Episode 3) and restaurant mentions (Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant and Cree-Mee Drive). All four search results were properly saved to workspace JSON files. The output reveals important findings: the show format (Ali Khan visits cities with $35 budget for meals), specific New Mexico locations (Albuquerque episode, Cimarron restaurant), and restaurant details (Papa Felipe's with sopaipilla stuffed with carne, Cree-Mee Drive with green/red chile). However, the James Beard Award winners book connection wasn't clearly established in the search results. **PLAN** alignment: 80% complete - show identification and New Mexico episodes found, but the specific restaurant recommended by James Beard Award winners needs further investigation. Next step: Analyze the saved JSON files more deeply to extract specific episode details and search more specifically for the James Beard Award winners restaurant book connection.",

First inspecting the JSON file structures to understand their format, then systematically extracting key details including: (1) Show identification - 'Cheap Eats' starting 2015 on Cooking Channel, (2) New Mexico episodes - Albuquerque Season 1 Episode 3, (3) Specific restaurants visited - Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant and Cree-Mee Drive with their featured dishes and locations, (4) Show format details - $35 budget per city. Compiling all findings into a structured summary and identifying that the James Beard Award winners book connection still needs further investigation.

The script successfully extracted and compiled key information about Ali Khan's show 'Cheap Eats' (started 2015 on Cooking Channel), identified the Albuquerque episode (Season 1, Episode 3), and found two New Mexico restaurants: Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant (featuring sopaipilla stuffed with carne) and Cree-Mee Drive in Cimarron (featuring green/red chile and strawberry shake). The analysis properly structured the findings and saved them to 'ali_khan_compiled_findings.json'. However, the James Beard Award winners book connection remains unidentified - the search4 results didn't contain clear connections between the restaurants Ali Khan visited and any James Beard Award winners' book recommendations. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - show name, format, New Mexico episodes and restaurants are identified, but the crucial James Beard Award connection is missing. Next step: Conduct more targeted searches specifically for James Beard Award winners who wrote restaurant recommendation books that mention either Papa Felipe's or Cree-Mee Drive, or search for New Mexico restaurant guidebooks by James Beard Award winners.",

This directly answers the **PLAN** requirement to identify which restaurant Ali Khan visited that was later recommended by two James Beard Award winners in a book. The code also properly reviewed existing compiled findings showing the complete picture: Show = 'Cheap Eats' (2015, Cooking Channel), New Mexico restaurants = Papa Felipe's (Albuquerque) and Cree-Mee Drive (Cimarron), and now the James Beard connection = Jane and Michael Stern's 2009 publication recommending Papa Felipe's. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - all major requirements identified except need to confirm the specific book title. The searches were properly saved to workspace files for reference.
