This initial implementation conducts three targeted Google searches: (1) general search for Ali Khan TV show 2015 with cost-conscious keywords, (2) specific Food Network search with budget/cheap eats terms, and (3) targeted search for 'Cheap Eats' show which is likely the show we're looking for. The code uses SerpAPI to gather comprehensive search results, displays key information from each search (titles, URLs, snippets), and saves all results to workspace/ali_khan_search_results.json for further analysis. This approach allows us to cast a wide net initially to identify the correct show name and format before drilling down into specific episodes and New Mexico restaurant visits.",

The search results clearly show that the show is called 'Cheap Eats' which premiered in 2015 on Cooking Channel. Key findings: (1) Show name: 'Cheap Eats', (2) Format: Ali Khan visits different US cities with only $35 and 12 hours to find great deals for breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner, (3) Network: Cooking Channel (not Food Network), (4) Premiered: September 22, 2015. The search results have been saved to workspace/ali_khan_search_results.json for reference. **PLAN** alignment: 30% complete - show identification successful, but still need to search specifically for New Mexico episodes, James Beard Award winner restaurant recommendations, and related books.

    "description": "Building on the successful show identification from the previous search, this implementation conducts targeted searches for the remaining PLAN requirements. First, I inspect the existing search results file to understand its structure and confirm our findings about 'Cheap Eats'. Then I conduct four additional focused searches: (1) Cheap Eats New Mexico episodes, (2) Albuquerque-specific episodes, (3) James Beard Award winners with New Mexico restaurant connections, and (4) New Mexican cuisine James Beard winners with books/cookbooks. The code saves all new results to workspace/ali_khan_nm_james_beard_results.json and creates a comprehensive research summary in workspace/ali_khan_research_summary.json. This systematic approach ensures we gather all necessary information about New Mexico episodes, James Beard Award winner restaurant recommendations, and any related books, completing the full scope of the PLAN requirements.",

The script successfully inspected previous search results, conducted 4 additional targeted searches for New Mexico episodes and James Beard connections, and saved comprehensive results to multiple files. Key accomplishments: (1) Confirmed show identification: 'Cheap Eats' hosted by Ali Khan, premiered September 22, 2015 on Cooking Channel, (2) Found specific New Mexico evidence: Cree-Mee Drive in Cimarron, NM and Papa Felipe's in Albuquerque where Ali Khan visited, (3) Identified James Beard Award winner Cheryl Alters Jamison with New Mexico food expertise, (4) Created organized data files: ali_khan_nm_james_beard_results.json and ali_khan_research_summary.json. The output contains valuable research data (200+ lines) with specific restaurant names, episode details, and James Beard connections. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - successfully identified the show, found New Mexico restaurant visits, and located James Beard connections. Recommendation: Save the detailed search results output to 'workspace/detailed_search_analysis.txt' for future reference, then analyze the saved JSON files to extract specific episode names and book titles to fully complete the PLAN requirements.",

    "description": "This final implementation completes the comprehensive analysis of Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show research. First, I safely inspect all JSON files in the workspace to understand their structure before accessing any data - following the reminder about proper file inspection practices. Then I systematically extract and analyze the search results to identify: (1) specific New Mexico restaurants visited (Cree-Mee Drive in Cimarron, Papa Felipe's in Albuquerque), (2) James Beard Award winner connections (Cheryl Alters Jamison), and (3) books with restaurant recommendations (Rancho de Chimayo Cookbook). The code creates two final output files: a comprehensive JSON analysis (cheap_eats_final_analysis.json) and a human-readable report (cheap_eats_final_report.txt) that documents all findings. This systematic approach ensures 100% completion of the PLAN requirements by identifying the show name, format, New Mexico episodes with specific restaurants, James Beard Award winner connections, and related books - providing a complete research deliverable.",

The script inspected all saved JSON files, extracted specific information about New Mexico restaurants (Cree-Mee Drive in Cimarron, Papa Felipe's in Albuquerque), identified James Beard Award winner Cheryl Alters Jamison with New Mexico expertise, and found the Rancho de Chimayo Cookbook as a book with restaurant recommendations. The code created two final output files: 'cheap_eats_final_analysis.json' with structured data and 'cheap_eats_final_report.txt' with a human-readable summary. All PLAN objectives have been achieved: (1) Show identified: 'Cheap Eats' by Ali Khan starting 2015, (2) Format confirmed: $35 budget, 12 hours per city, (3) New Mexico episodes found with specific restaurants, (4) James Beard Award winner identified, (5) Book with restaurant recommendations located.
