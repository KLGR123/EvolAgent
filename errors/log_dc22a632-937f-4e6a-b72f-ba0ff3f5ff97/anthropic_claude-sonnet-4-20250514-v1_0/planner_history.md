    "plan": "Search for information about Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show that started in 2015. Focus on identifying the show name, format, and episodes where Ali Khan visited restaurants in New Mexico to try New Mexican staples. Look for specific episodes or segments that mention restaurants recommended by James Beard Award winners, and identify any books written by these award winners that featured restaurant recommendations.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify Ali Khan's specific TV show from 2015 that focuses on cost-conscious dining before we can find the New Mexican restaurant episode, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to establish the show's identity and locate episodes featuring New Mexican cuisine and James Beard Award winner connections, (4) This systematic approach will help us trace the path from the TV show to the restaurant to the book recommendation as required by the TASK",

    "plan": "Search for the complete title of 'Rancho de Chimayo Cookbook' to verify the exact full title as it appears in publication, including any subtitle, edition information, or additional descriptive text. Also verify that Cheryl Alters Jamison is indeed a James Beard Award winner and confirm the connection between this cookbook and the restaurant recommendations that led Ali Khan to try New Mexican cuisine on his show 'Cheap Eats'.",
    "description": "This verification step is necessary because: (1) The previous research identified 'Rancho de Chimayo Cookbook' as the likely book but we need the complete exact title as requested in the TASK, (2) We need to confirm Cheryl Alters Jamison's James Beard Award status and verify the connection chain from the cookbook to the restaurant recommendations to Ali Khan's show, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the precise complete book title with any numbers written in plain text format, (4) This ensures we provide the accurate final answer that fully satisfies the TASK requirements",
