# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for information about Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show that started in 2015. Focus on identifying the show name, format, and episodes where Ali Khan visited restaurants in New Mexico to try New Mexican staples. Look for specific episodes or segments that mention restaurants recommended by James Beard Award winners, and identify any books written by these award winners that featured restaurant recommendations.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify Ali Khan's specific TV show from 2015 that focuses on cost-conscious dining before we can find the New Mexican restaurant episode, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to establish the show's identity and locate episodes featuring New Mexican cuisine and James Beard Award winner connections, (4) This systematic approach will help us trace the path from the TV show to the restaurant to the book recommendation as required by the TASK

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 5: Extract Teal’c’s response to “Isn’t that hot?” from YouTube video 1htKBjuUWec.

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Consumer electronics review video summarization and hot phrase detection for product marketing teams
- Podcast episode transcription and targeted keyword extraction for journalism archives
- Court deposition video transcription and specific quote identification for legal case preparations
- Academic lecture video segment tagging and concept extraction for e-learning curriculum development
- Compliance training video review to locate mandatory disclaimers and policy acknowledgments in corporate audit workflows
- Media archiving and cataloging to index iconic catchphrases and scene metadata in television episode databases
- Social media influencer video analysis to extract brand mentions and measure sentiment for marketing research
- Accessibility enhancement by transcribing video content and generating precise caption segments for hearing-impaired audiences

### Development Step 2: Locate “Isn’t That Hot?” Dialogue in YouTube Video and Document Teal’c’s Exact Response

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate eLearning team retrieving and timestamping critical Q&A segments from training videos for onboarding documentation
- Legal eDiscovery specialists scanning and transcribing targeted dialogue from publicly posted deposition videos for case evidence preparation
- Marketing analysts monitoring influencer product reviews on YouTube, extracting and cataloging instances of brand mentions for sentiment tracking
- Academic linguistics researchers locating and transcribing specific phonetic phenomena in lecture videos to support corpus-based language studies
- Compliance officers identifying segments in financial webinars where regulatory requirements are discussed, to ensure accurate policy implementation
- Podcast producers automating extraction of sponsor-read ad segments from long-form video content to streamline editing and QC processes
- Accessibility coordinators generating precise transcripts of key interactions in educational videos to improve captioning accuracy for hearing-impaired students

### Development Step 6: Locate “Isn’t that hot?” exchange and transcribe Teal’c’s exact response from the YouTube video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Customer support call transcription and specific complaint keyword spotting for quality assurance in contact centers
- Lecture video transcription and student question‐answer extraction for e-learning platforms
- Surveillance audio analysis and suspicious phrase detection for security operations in law enforcement
- Focus group session transcription and sentiment keyword identification for product development teams
- Archival broadcast video indexing and catchphrase search for media libraries and content distributors
- Medical consultation recording transcription and symptom keyword extraction for electronic health record enhancement
- Podcast episode transcription and topic segment annotation for content creators and publishers
- Legal deposition video transcription and critical phrase highlighting for law firms and court reporting services

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Extracting and timestamping key customer feedback phrases (e.g., “This product saved me”) from recorded user testimonial videos to streamline marketing content creation
- Automatically identifying and isolating objection-handling responses (e.g., “Isn’t that expensive?”) in sales training recordings for targeted coaching improvements
- Scanning archived corporate town hall livestreams to locate and transcribe specific policy-related Q&A segments (e.g., “How will this impact our benefits?”) for HR documentation
- Monitoring compliance in financial webinars by detecting and extracting disclaimers (e.g., “Past performance does not guarantee future results”) to ensure regulatory adherence
- Harvesting precise technical definitions (e.g., “A tensor is…”) from recorded academic lectures to build a searchable glossary for e-learning platforms
- Analyzing product review unboxing videos to find and compile sensory reaction comments (e.g., “It feels so smooth”) for R&D insights on material performance
- Reviewing legal deposition videos to pinpoint and transcribe witness admissions of fact (e.g., “I saw him at 8 p.m.”) to accelerate case preparation
- Indexing cooking show episodes to extract chef remarks on safety (e.g., “Be careful—this oil is extremely hot”) for automated closed-caption warnings in streaming services

### Development Step 4: Find Teal’c’s Response to “Isn’t That Hot?” in YouTube Video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Extracting and transcribing customer support training videos to locate “Isn’t that required?” questions and capture the trainer’s exact clarifications for building an automated FAQ database
- Processing courtroom hearing recordings to find when attorneys ask “Isn’t that admissible?” and documenting the judge’s precise rulings for legal case management systems
- Analyzing product demo webinars to identify “Isn’t that expensive?” viewer queries and extract the presenter’s detailed cost‐benefit responses for marketing collateral
- Indexing academic lecture videos to transcribe moments when students ask “Isn’t that assumption flawed?” and record the professor’s counterarguments for online course summaries
- Reviewing medical conference sessions to locate “Isn’t that harmful?” audience concerns and capture the expert’s exact explanations for compliance documentation
- Localizing film trailers by transcribing “Isn’t that dramatic?” taglines and extracting actors’ follow‐up lines to generate accurate subtitles and dubbing scripts
- Auditing internal compliance briefing videos to find “Isn’t that mandatory?” employee queries and preserve the compliance officer’s responses for policy enforcement records
