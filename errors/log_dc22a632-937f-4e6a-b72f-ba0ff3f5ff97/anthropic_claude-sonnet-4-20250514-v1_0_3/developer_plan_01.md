# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for information about Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show that started in 2015. Focus on identifying the show's name, format, and episodes where Ali Khan visited New Mexican restaurants to try local staples. Look for episodes that featured restaurants recommended by James Beard Award winners in books, and identify the complete title of such books including any numbers written in plain text.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify Ali Khan's 2015 cost-conscious TV show and find episodes featuring New Mexican cuisine before we can locate the specific restaurant and book recommendations, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to narrow down the show and identify episodes with New Mexican restaurant visits that were featured in books by James Beard Award winners, (4) This systematic approach will help us trace the connection between the TV show, restaurant visit, and book recommendation to find the complete book title as requested

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 5: Extract Teal’c’s response to “Isn’t that hot?” from YouTube video 1htKBjuUWec.

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Consumer electronics review video summarization and hot phrase detection for product marketing teams
- Podcast episode transcription and targeted keyword extraction for journalism archives
- Court deposition video transcription and specific quote identification for legal case preparations
- Academic lecture video segment tagging and concept extraction for e-learning curriculum development
- Compliance training video review to locate mandatory disclaimers and policy acknowledgments in corporate audit workflows
- Media archiving and cataloging to index iconic catchphrases and scene metadata in television episode databases
- Social media influencer video analysis to extract brand mentions and measure sentiment for marketing research
- Accessibility enhancement by transcribing video content and generating precise caption segments for hearing-impaired audiences

### Development Step 4: Find Teal’c’s Response to “Isn’t That Hot?” in YouTube Video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Extracting and transcribing customer support training videos to locate “Isn’t that required?” questions and capture the trainer’s exact clarifications for building an automated FAQ database
- Processing courtroom hearing recordings to find when attorneys ask “Isn’t that admissible?” and documenting the judge’s precise rulings for legal case management systems
- Analyzing product demo webinars to identify “Isn’t that expensive?” viewer queries and extract the presenter’s detailed cost‐benefit responses for marketing collateral
- Indexing academic lecture videos to transcribe moments when students ask “Isn’t that assumption flawed?” and record the professor’s counterarguments for online course summaries
- Reviewing medical conference sessions to locate “Isn’t that harmful?” audience concerns and capture the expert’s exact explanations for compliance documentation
- Localizing film trailers by transcribing “Isn’t that dramatic?” taglines and extracting actors’ follow‐up lines to generate accurate subtitles and dubbing scripts
- Auditing internal compliance briefing videos to find “Isn’t that mandatory?” employee queries and preserve the compliance officer’s responses for policy enforcement records
