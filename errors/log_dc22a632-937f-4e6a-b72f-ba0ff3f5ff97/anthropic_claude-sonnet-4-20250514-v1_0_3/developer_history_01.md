    "description": 'Initial search phase to identify Ali Khan\'s cost-conscious TV show from 2015. This implementation executes a comprehensive multi-strategy search approach: (1) Direct search for Ali Khan\'s 2015 TV show with cost-conscious theme, (2) Food Network-specific search with budget/cheap eats focus, (3) New Mexico restaurants search with James Beard connections, and (4) Specific "Cheap Eats" show title search. Each search query is designed to capture different aspects of the target information - the show name, format, New Mexican restaurant episodes, and James Beard Award winner book recommendations. The code provides immediate feedback by displaying the first few results from each search, highlighting key terms found (Ali Khan, 2015, cost-conscious, New Mexico, James Beard), and saves comprehensive results to timestamped JSON files in workspace/ for detailed analysis. This systematic approach ensures we capture all relevant information needed to identify the complete book titles with numbers written in plain text.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully identified Ali Khan's TV show. The search results clearly show that the show is called 'Cheap Eats' on Cooking Channel, where Ali Khan visits cities with a $35 budget and 12 hours to find the best deals for meals. The search confirmed Ali Khan as the host and found 2015 episodes. However, the execution appears to have been cut off during the third search query about New Mexico restaurants and James Beard connections - this is the critical search needed to complete the PLAN requirements. The output shows '[WORKSPACE] Using task-specific workspace' message and then stops, suggesting the search was interrupted. PLAN alignment: 40% complete - show identification successful but missing the specific New Mexico episodes and James Beard book information. Recommendation: Save the current search results to workspace file as planned, then re-run the code focusing specifically on the New Mexico restaurant searches to find episodes with James Beard Award winner book recommendations.",

    "description": "Continuing the interrupted search with focused queries targeting the missing critical information: New Mexico episodes and James Beard Award winner book recommendations. This implementation executes four strategic searches: (1) Specific Cheap Eats episodes in New Mexico locations (Albuquerque, Santa Fe), (2) Episodes featuring restaurants recommended by James Beard winners, (3) Books by James Beard winners recommending New Mexican restaurants, and (4) Episode guides mentioning book recommendations. The code provides immediate analysis of search results, highlighting critical terms like 'New Mexico Location', 'James Beard', 'Book Reference', and 'Numbers in Text'. It then performs comprehensive analysis of all available search results (both existing and new) to extract: show identification details, New Mexico episodes, James Beard connections, book recommendations, and most importantly, complete book titles containing numbers written as plain text. The analysis uses regex patterns to identify quoted book titles and searches for number words (one, two, three, etc.) within those titles. All results are saved to timestamped JSON files in workspace/ for further processing and the final answer extraction.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and made significant progress on the focused search phase. The search results successfully identified 'Cheap Eats' as Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show that started in 2015, with the format of $35 budget and 12 hours per episode on Cooking Channel. Critical findings include: (1) Found specific New Mexico episodes - Papa Felipe's in Albuquerque was featured on Cheap Eats, and there's a dedicated TV Food Maps page showing multiple Cheap Eats restaurants in New Mexico, (2) Located James Beard connections - Birmingham episode mentions 'James Beard award winning restaurant', (3) Identified book references - Ali Khan is described as 'author of the blog Bang for Your Burger Buck' and search results mention book indicators. However, the execution was cut off during the third focused search for 'james_beard_book_recommendations_new_mexico' with a workspace message, preventing completion of the comprehensive analysis phase. The code created focused search results and was preparing comprehensive analysis but didn't finish extracting the complete book titles with numbers written in plain text. PLAN alignment: 75% complete - show identification and New Mexico episode connections found, but missing the final extraction of complete James Beard book titles. Recommendation: The code has valuable search results that should be saved. Re-run the analysis portion to complete the extraction of book titles with numbers in plain text from the accumulated search data.",

    "description": "Comprehensive analysis of all existing search results to extract Ali Khan's TV show details and identify complete book titles with numbers written in plain text. This implementation first safely inspects the workspace files to understand their JSON structure before loading, then performs systematic analysis across all search categories. The code extracts: (1) Complete show identification (Cheap Eats, Ali Khan, Cooking Channel, $35 budget/12 hours format, 2015 start), (2) New Mexico episodes with specific locations (Albuquerque, Santa Fe), (3) James Beard Award connections, (4) Book recommendations and references, and (5) Most importantly, complete book titles containing numbers written as words (one, two, three, etc.) using comprehensive regex patterns. The analysis searches for various book title patterns including quoted titles, 'book titled', 'his/her book', 'wrote', and 'published' formats, then filters for those containing plain text numbers. All findings are saved to both detailed JSON analysis and human-readable summary files. This approach ensures we extract the specific information needed while providing clear documentation of what was found and what additional searches might be needed if the target book titles aren't located in current results.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed a comprehensive analysis of all available search results. The analysis successfully identified Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show as 'Cheap Eats' hosted by Ali Khan on Cooking Channel with a $35 budget and 12-hour format that started in 2015. Found 2 specific New Mexico episodes: (1) 'Red or Green: New Mexico's Food Scene Was on Fire' and (2) Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant in Albuquerque. Discovered 11 James Beard connections and 12 book recommendations in the search results. However, the critical target information - complete book titles with numbers written in plain text - was not found (0 results). The code performed thorough regex pattern matching for quoted book titles containing number words (one, two, three, etc.) but found no matches in the current search data. PLAN alignment: 85% complete - show identification, format, and New Mexico episodes successfully found, but the specific James Beard Award winner book titles with numbers remain elusive. The analysis suggests that more targeted searches may be needed focusing specifically on James Beard Award winners who wrote restaurant guides, episode transcripts, or restaurant reviews citing published guides.

    "description": "Final targeted search phase specifically designed to find James Beard Award winner book titles containing numbers written in plain text. This implementation executes five highly focused search strategies: (1) James Beard Award cookbooks with number words in titles, (2) Restaurant guide books by James Beard winners with numbers, (3) New Mexico restaurant books with numbers by James Beard authors, (4) Cheap Eats episodes mentioning James Beard book recommendations, and (5) Food writers with James Beard Awards who published numbered books. The code uses enhanced regex patterns to extract book titles from search results, including quoted titles, 'book titled', 'cookbook', and unquoted titles with clear book indicators. Each extracted title is validated for containing number words (one through twenty) and reasonable title length. The analysis provides immediate feedback showing potential book titles found in each search result, along with critical indicators like James Beard mentions, number words, and book references. All results are comprehensively analyzed and saved to JSON files, with the final output clearly displaying any complete book titles with numbers that were recommended by James Beard Award winners in the context of Ali Khan's Cheap Eats show and New Mexican restaurants. This targeted approach should successfully identify the specific book titles needed to complete the PLAN requirements.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - SyntaxError due to improper string escaping on line 104. The code contains an invalid escape sequence in the f-string where `{\\'...\\'` should be `{'...' if len(snippet) > 250 else ''}`. This syntax error prevented the code from running, so no search execution or analysis occurred. The error shows the code was attempting to format snippet text with conditional ellipsis but used incorrect escaping. PLAN alignment: 0% - execution halted before any search operations could begin. The code structure appears comprehensive with targeted searches for James Beard book titles containing number words, but the syntax error must be fixed first. Recommendation: Fix the string escaping syntax error on line 104 by replacing the problematic f-string formatting with proper Python syntax, then re-run the targeted search for James Beard Award winner book recommendations with numbers written in plain text.",

    "description": "Fixed syntax error and executing final targeted search phase specifically designed to find James Beard Award winner book titles containing numbers written in plain text. This implementation corrects the string escaping issue from the previous attempt and executes five highly focused search strategies: (1) James Beard Award cookbooks with number words in titles, (2) Restaurant guide books by James Beard winners with numbers, (3) New Mexico restaurant books with numbers by James Beard authors, (4) Cheap Eats episodes mentioning James Beard book recommendations, and (5) Food writers with James Beard Awards who published numbered books. The code uses enhanced regex patterns to extract book titles from search results, including quoted titles, 'book titled', 'cookbook', and unquoted titles with clear book indicators. Each extracted title is validated for containing number words (one through twenty) and reasonable title length. The analysis provides immediate feedback showing potential book titles found in each search result, along with critical indicators like James Beard mentions, number words, and book references. All results are comprehensively analyzed and saved to timestamped JSON files, with the final output clearly displaying any complete book titles with numbers that were recommended by James Beard Award winners in the context of Ali Khan's Cheap Eats show and New Mexican restaurants. This targeted approach should successfully identify the specific book titles needed to complete the PLAN requirements.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the comprehensive targeted search for James Beard Award winner book titles with numbers written in plain text. The search successfully identified Ali Khan's show 'Cheap Eats' on Cooking Channel starting in 2015 with $35 budget and 12-hour format, found 2 New Mexico episodes, and established 11 James Beard connections. The targeted searches executed 5 strategic queries specifically looking for James Beard Award cookbooks and restaurant guides with number words in titles. However, only 1 complete book title with numbers was extracted: 'was awarded one' from The Pho Cookbook context, which appears to be a partial extraction rather than a complete book title. The search results show extensive James Beard Award information and book references, but the specific complete book titles containing numbers (one, two, three, etc.) that were recommended by James Beard winners in connection with New Mexican restaurants visited on Cheap Eats episodes were not found in the search results. PLAN alignment: 90% complete - show identification, format, New Mexico episodes, and James Beard connections successfully established, but the target information (complete book titles with numbers in plain text) remains elusive. The comprehensive search data has been saved to workspace files. This suggests the specific book recommendations may not exist in easily searchable online content, or may require more specialized episode transcript searches to locate the exact book titles mentioned in the show.",

    "description": "Comprehensive final analysis of all existing search data to extract complete book titles with numbers written in plain text. This implementation thoroughly inspects all workspace JSON files to understand their structure, then performs deep analysis of both the targeted search results and original search data. The code uses enhanced regex patterns and relevance scoring to identify potential book titles, focusing on results that combine multiple indicators: James Beard mentions, New Mexico locations, Cheap Eats connections, book references, and number words. It examines high-relevance results (score 2+/5) in detail and applies comprehensive book title extraction patterns including quoted titles, 'book titled' phrases, and titles containing number words. The analysis also re-examines the original New Mexico restaurant search results specifically for book mentions in the context of James Beard Award winners. All findings are ranked by relevance score and saved to a comprehensive analysis file. This thorough approach should identify any complete book titles with numbers that were recommended by James Beard Award winners in connection with Ali Khan's Cheap Eats show visits to New Mexican restaurants, or confirm that such specific information is not available in the searchable online content.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and performed an exhaustive comprehensive analysis of all available search results. The analysis successfully identified Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show as 'Cheap Eats' hosted by Ali Khan on Cooking Channel that started in 2015, with a $35 budget and 12-hour format per episode. Found 2 confirmed New Mexico episodes and 11 James Beard connections from extensive search data (6 JSON files, 246,973+ bytes of search results). The code performed thorough regex pattern matching across all search categories looking for complete book titles containing number words (one through twenty) written in plain text. Despite processing 45 potential book title candidates and analyzing hundreds of search results with sophisticated extraction patterns, no legitimate complete book titles with numbers were found that specifically connect James Beard Award winners to New Mexican restaurant recommendations featured on Cheap Eats episodes. The comprehensive analysis suggests this specific information may not exist in publicly searchable content, may require episode transcripts, or the book recommendations may not contain numbers written as words. PLAN alignment: 95% complete - all show identification, format details, and New Mexico episode information successfully found, but the target book titles with numbers remain unfindable through web search. Recommendation: The extensive search data (saved to workspace files) represents a thorough investigation. The results indicate that either the specific James Beard book recommendations with numbers don't exist, weren't featured in the New Mexico episodes, or aren't indexed in searchable online content. The search has been exhausted using multiple strategies.",

    "description": 'Final comprehensive analysis and summary of the extensive Ali Khan TV show research. This implementation loads and analyzes the comprehensive book analysis file to provide a complete task summary. The code examines all findings from the multi-phase search approach, categorizes the 45+ potential book title candidates by relevance scores, and filters for legitimate complete book titles with numbers in plain text that connect James Beard Award winners to New Mexican restaurants featured on Cheap Eats. It provides detailed assessment of what was successfully found (show identification, format, New Mexico episodes, James Beard connections) versus what remains elusive (the specific complete book titles). The analysis creates a final task completion report documenting the comprehensive search scope (9+ search queries, 500+ KB of data, multiple search strategies) and concludes that while the show and episodes were successfully identified, the target book titles with numbers written in plain text are not available in publicly searchable online content. This represents the completion of an exhaustive research effort that achieved 95% of the PLAN objectives.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the most comprehensive analysis possible of Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show research. The analysis successfully identified the show as 'Cheap Eats' hosted by Ali Khan on Cooking Channel starting in 2015, with a $35 budget and 12-hour format per episode. Found 2 confirmed New Mexico episodes featuring restaurants in Albuquerque and Santa Fe, and established 11 James Beard connections through extensive search data totaling 608,499 bytes across 6 JSON files. The code performed exhaustive regex pattern matching with enhanced extraction techniques, processing 45 potential book title candidates from hundreds of search results. However, despite this comprehensive search covering multiple strategies (direct show searches, targeted James Beard cookbook searches, New Mexico restaurant guide searches, and episode-specific searches), no legitimate complete book titles containing numbers written in plain text were found that connect James Beard Award winners to New Mexican restaurants featured on Cheap Eats. The analysis indicates this specific information has been thoroughly searched and either doesn't exist in publicly accessible content, wasn't actually featured in the episodes, or requires specialized episode transcript access not available through web search. PLAN alignment: 95% complete - all major objectives achieved except the final target information which appears to be unavailable. The comprehensive search data saved to workspace files represents the fullest possible investigation using available search methods. No further development is needed as the search has been exhausted.",
