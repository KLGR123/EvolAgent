    "plan": "Search for information about Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show that started in 2015. Focus on identifying the show's name, format, and episodes where Ali Khan visited New Mexican restaurants to try local staples. Look for episodes that featured restaurants recommended by James Beard Award winners in books, and identify the complete title of such books including any numbers written in plain text.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify Ali Khan's 2015 cost-conscious TV show and find episodes featuring New Mexican cuisine before we can locate the specific restaurant and book recommendations, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to narrow down the show and identify episodes with New Mexican restaurant visits that were featured in books by James Beard Award winners, (4) This systematic approach will help us trace the connection between the TV show, restaurant visit, and book recommendation to find the complete book title as requested",

    "description": "Task completed with comprehensive search exhaustion. Based on the extensive analysis performed by the developer: (1) Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show 'Cheap Eats' starting in 2015 was successfully identified, along with confirmed New Mexico episodes featuring restaurants in Albuquerque and Santa Fe area, (2) Multiple James Beard Award connections were established across the show's episodes, (3) Despite exhaustive searches covering 97 search results, 50+ book title candidates, and 608,499+ bytes of data across 9 JSON files using multiple strategic approaches, no complete book title with numbers written in plain text by James Beard Award winners recommending New Mexican restaurants featured on Cheap Eats could be definitively identified in publicly available online content. The search methodologies included direct show searches, James Beard cookbook searches, restaurant guide searches, episode-specific searches, and comprehensive cross-analysis. While the investigation successfully mapped the show format, New Mexico episodes, and James Beard connections, the specific book title appears to either not exist in searchable online content, require specialized episode transcript access, or may not have been publicly documented in the expected format. Final answer: Unable to determine the complete book title despite comprehensive search completion.",
