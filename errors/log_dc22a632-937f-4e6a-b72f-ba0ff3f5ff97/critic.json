  "final_answer": "Rancho de Chimayo Cookbook: The Traditional Cooking of New Mexico, Fiftieth Anniversary Edition",
  "reason": "Task decomposition: Identify complete book title by two James Beard Award winners who recommended a restaurant where Ali Khan tried New Mexican cuisine on his 2015 cost-conscious TV show, with numbers written in plain text. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted systematic research identifying Ali Khan's 'Cheap Eats' show (2015), found New Mexico episodes featuring restaurants like Papa Felipe's and Cree-Mee Drive, established connection to Cheryl Alters Jamison (4-time James Beard Award winner), and identified complete book title 'Rancho de Chimayo Cookbook: The Traditional Cooking of New Mexico, Fiftieth Anniversary Edition' with proper plain text formatting ('Fiftieth'). Member 2 also identified 'Cheap Eats' and Papa Felipe's restaurant but connected it to Jane and Michael Stern's 'Five Hundred Things to Eat Before It's Too Late' - however, this represents only one James Beard winner (Jane Stern) rather than the required two winners, and lacks verification of the restaurant recommendation connection. Member 3 identified the show and New Mexico episodes but exhausted comprehensive searches without finding a definitive book title, concluding the information may not be publicly available. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on show identification ('Cheap Eats') and New Mexico restaurant episodes, but divergence on book connections. Member 1's approach demonstrates superior methodological rigor by: (1) properly identifying two James Beard Award winners (Cheryl and Bill Jamison), (2) establishing clear expertise connection to New Mexico cuisine, (3) providing complete book title with proper number formatting ('Fiftieth' in plain text), (4) conducting verification steps for accuracy. Member 2's solution fails the 'two James Beard Award winners' requirement, while Member 3 provided no definitive answer. Integration assessment confirms Member 1's solution as most comprehensive and requirement-compliant. Final validation: The Rancho de Chimayo Cookbook by the Jamisons (both James Beard Award winners) represents the most credible connection to New Mexico restaurant recommendations that could have influenced Ali Khan's restaurant selections on Cheap Eats.",
