    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the starting point by accessing Carl Nebel's Wikipedia page as it appeared in August 2023, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the Wikipedia page, identify the first citation reference, and begin tracing the path to the target webpage with images, (4) This establishes the foundation for systematically following the citation link and analyzing the image content for chronological dates.",
