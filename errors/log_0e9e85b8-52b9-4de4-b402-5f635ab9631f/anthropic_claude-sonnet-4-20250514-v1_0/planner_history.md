Extract the complete page content and identify all citation reference links, focusing on locating the first citation reference link in the article. Document the specific URL or source that this first citation points to for subsequent analysis.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to establish the exact state of Carl Nebel's Wikipedia page as it existed in August 2023 to ensure we're working with the correct version, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the archived page content and identify the first citation reference link that we'll need to follow, (4) This establishes the foundation for the multi-step process of following the citation link and then analyzing the resulting webpage for chronological year dates.",
