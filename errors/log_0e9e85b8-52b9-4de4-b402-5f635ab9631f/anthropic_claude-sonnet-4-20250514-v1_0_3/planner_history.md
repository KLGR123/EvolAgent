Extract the first citation reference link from the page and prepare to follow it to the target webpage.

    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to locate Carl Nebel's Wikipedia page and examine its citation structure to identify the first reference link, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the Wikipedia page and extract the first citation reference URL, (4) This establishes the foundation for subsequently accessing the referenced webpage and analyzing any images containing chronological year dates.",

    "description": 'Task completed successfully! The **PLAN** objective has been fully achieved:\n\n✅ **Carl Nebel Wikipedia Page Access**: Successfully accessed the archived version from March 2023 (closest to August 2023) using the Wayback Machine API.\n\n✅ **First Citation Reference Extraction**: Located the References section, identified 9 citations with [1] being the first, and successfully extracted the first citation reference link pointing to \'Thieme-Becker\' (http://web.archive.org/web/20230306063201/https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thieme-Becker).\n\n✅ **Target Webpage Analysis**: Successfully followed the first citation link to the target webpage, which led to the German Wikipedia page for Thieme-Becker art lexicon. The target page was fully accessed, parsed, and analyzed.\n\n**Key Results Achieved**:\n- First citation format: [1] reference number with link text "Thieme-Becker"\n- Citation leads to archived German Wikipedia page about the Thieme-Becker art encyclopedia\n- Target webpage content: 39,037 characters of clean text extracted\n- Page structure analyzed: 5 main headings identified\n- All content saved to workspace with complete metadata\n\n**Files Created**:\n1. `carl_nebel_citation_link_extracted.json` (1,009 bytes) - Citation analysis with link details\n2. `target_webpage_content.html` (181,555 bytes) - Raw HTML of target page\n3. `target_webpage_text.txt` (40,570 bytes) - Clean text content\n4. `target_webpage_analysis.json` (909 bytes) - Structural analysis\n5. `carl_nebel_wikipedia_august_2023.html` (100,144 bytes) - Original Wikipedia archive\n6. `carl_nebel_clean_text.txt` (5,648 bytes) - Clean Wikipedia text\n\n**Technical Achievement**: The implementation successfully navigated Wikipedia\'s reference structure, correctly distinguished between the References heading and actual reference list content, extracted valid external links while filtering internal anchors, and properly handled archived content via Wayback Machine.\n\nThe task is complete - we have successfully identified the first citation reference format, extracted the specific external link it points to, and thoroughly analyzed the target webpage content. The citation system analysis shows that Carl Nebel\'s Wikipedia page properly references the Thieme-Becker art encyclopedia as its first source, demonstrating standard Wikipedia citation practices.',
