  "final_answer": "1803",
  "reason": "Task decomposition: Find the latest chronological year date written in images on the webpage accessed through the first citation reference link from Carl Nebel's Wikipedia page as of August 2023. This requires: (1) accessing the correct Wikipedia version, (2) identifying the first citation reference, (3) following that link, and (4) analyzing images specifically for year dates. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 accessed Carl Nebel's Wikipedia page and followed the first citation to https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Rose_Lemercier, conducting focused analysis of 24 images and their contexts (table cells, captions, parent elements), finding years 1792 and 1803 specifically in image-related contexts, concluding 1803 as the latest. Member 2 accessed the Wikipedia page but followed a different citation reference to the Thieme-Becker page, finding 97 years (1763-2023) but analyzed general webpage content rather than focusing specifically on images, concluding 2023. Member 3 also accessed the Thieme-Becker page, found 96 years (1763-2012) through general content analysis rather than image-specific analysis, concluding 2012. Cross-analysis reveals critical divergence: Members 2 and 3 followed different citation links than Member 1, and analyzed general webpage content rather than focusing specifically on images as required by the task. Member 1's approach demonstrates superior task comprehension by: (1) correctly identifying the first citation reference link, (2) focusing analysis specifically on images and their contexts rather than general webpage content, (3) using systematic methodology to examine image-related elements. Synthesis evaluation: The task specifically asks for 'year date written in the image' - Member 1's focused image analysis methodology directly addresses this requirement, while Members 2 and 3 conducted broader content analysis that doesn't specifically target images. Final validation: Member 1's answer of 1803 represents the most methodologically sound approach with proper focus on image-specific content analysis as required by the task specification.",
