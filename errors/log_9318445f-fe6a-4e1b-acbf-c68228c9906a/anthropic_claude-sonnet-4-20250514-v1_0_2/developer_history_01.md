    "description": "This is the first step in analyzing the image to extract fractions and sample problems. I'm using GPT-4o Vision API to comprehensively analyze the image and identify all fractions that use '/' as the fraction line, along with any sample problems and their answers. The approach includes: (1) Verifying the image file exists and is in a supported format, (2) Encoding the image for API processing, (3) Creating a detailed prompt that specifically asks for fractions using '/' and sample problems in order of appearance, (4) Sending the request to GPT-4o Vision API, (5) Saving the complete analysis to workspace for further processing. This will provide the foundation for creating the comma-separated list as required by the plan. The output will be saved to workspace/fraction_extraction_analysis.txt and workspace/extracted_elements.txt for subsequent formatting steps.",

The GPT-4o Vision API analyzed the image and extracted all fractions using '/' as the fraction line plus sample problems with their answers.

The complete extraction list with 25 total elements has been saved to workspace files. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete. The extracted elements are ready for final formatting as a comma-separated list with no whitespace.

    "description": 'This is the final step to complete the PLAN by formatting the extracted elements as a comma-separated list with no whitespace. The approach includes: (1) Reading the extracted elements from the previous GPT-4o analysis stored in workspace, (2) Parsing the numbered list format to extract just the fraction and sample problem values, (3) Removing numbering and formatting to get clean elements, (4) Joining all elements with commas and no spaces to create the final result, (5) Performing verification checks to ensure all 25 elements are captured correctly (18 fractions + 7 sample problems), (6) Saving the final comma-separated list and a detailed summary to workspace files. Based on the HISTORY feedback, the expected result should be: 3/4,1/4,3/4,1/4,2/4,1/2,5/35,7/21,30/5,2/4,1/2,6/8,4/60,30/90,8/18,9/72,44/66,206/340,6/8=,4/60=,30/90=,8/18=,9/72=,44/66=,206/340=. This completes the PLAN requirements by providing the final formatted output ready for submission.',
