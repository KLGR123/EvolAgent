# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png to identify all fractions that use '/' as the fraction line and extract the answers to any sample problems shown. Parse the image content systematically to locate each fraction in the order they appear, then compile them into a comma-separated list with no whitespace as requested.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to examine the provided image to identify fractions using '/' notation and sample problem answers, (2) No previous analysis of this image file has been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to extract all relevant fractions and answers in their order of appearance, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK requirements for creating the ordered comma-separated list

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 6: Python Script Analysis: String Array Operations from Image File data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png

**Description**: Extract and analyze the Python script from the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png to understand what operations it performs on string arrays.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated reconstruction of obfuscated URLs from archived web data for digital forensics investigations
- Dynamic generation of access links for protected resources in enterprise document management systems
- Extraction and reordering of encoded identifiers in bioinformatics pipelines for genome sequence analysis
- Restoration of original file paths from scrambled logs in cybersecurity incident response
- Custom URL creation for marketing campaigns where tracking codes are embedded via character reordering
- Decoding and validation of license keys or activation codes in software distribution workflows
- Reverse engineering of string-based puzzles or CAPTCHAs in automated testing environments
- Generating anonymized user profile links by permuting string identifiers in privacy-focused web applications

- Using an array of indices (url_indices) to specify character selection order
- Joining the selected characters to form a new string
- Concatenating with a base URL prefix to create the final result

This is essentially a string permutation/reordering operation based on index mapping.

### Development Step 1: Parse File Road Layout, Locate Houses, Mile Markers, Define Coordinates, Compute House-Tower Distances

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached file data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt to understand the road layout, identify all house positions, and map their locations relative to mile markers. Extract the visual representation showing dashes (-) as mile markers and H symbols as houses, then determine the coordinate system and calculate distances between houses and potential tower locations.

**Use Cases**:
- Rural broadband deployment planning: parse the ASCII road layout to extract house locations by mile marker, then calculate optimal fiber cable routes to bring high-speed internet to each home.
- Emergency medical services optimization: analyze the distances between mapped house positions and candidate ambulance station sites to determine the fastest response coverage along a remote highway.
- Postal delivery route automation: ingest the text-based road map to pinpoint rural mailbox locations, then compute the shortest delivery loop for mail carriers using mile-marker coordinates.
- Electric grid maintenance scheduling: map household positions relative to power line inspection crewsâ€™ depots to sequence pipeline or line checks by proximity and minimize downtime.
- Mobile network coverage analysis: identify service gaps by measuring distances from village houses to existing cell towers and recommend new tower installations to fill black spots.
- Environmental sensor network design: use the extracted house coordinates along farmland roads to position weather or soil-moisture sensors at optimal intervals for agricultural research.
- Real estate site evaluation: chart the distribution of roadside properties via mile markers to spotlight high-density clusters for targeted development and marketing campaigns.
