# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png to extract all fractions that use the forward slash (/) as the fraction line and identify any sample problems with their answers. Parse the image content systematically to locate fractions in the order they appear and compile them into a comma-separated list without whitespace as requested.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to examine the provided image to identify all fractions using / as the fraction line and any sample problem answers, (2) No previous analysis of this image file has been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to extract all relevant fractions and answers in their order of appearance, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK requirements for creating the ordered comma-separated list

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 6: Python Script Analysis: String Array Operations from Image File data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png

**Description**: Extract and analyze the Python script from the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png to understand what operations it performs on string arrays.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated reconstruction of obfuscated URLs from archived web data for digital forensics investigations
- Dynamic generation of access links for protected resources in enterprise document management systems
- Extraction and reordering of encoded identifiers in bioinformatics pipelines for genome sequence analysis
- Restoration of original file paths from scrambled logs in cybersecurity incident response
- Custom URL creation for marketing campaigns where tracking codes are embedded via character reordering
- Decoding and validation of license keys or activation codes in software distribution workflows
- Reverse engineering of string-based puzzles or CAPTCHAs in automated testing environments
- Generating anonymized user profile links by permuting string identifiers in privacy-focused web applications

The script performs character reordering by:

- Using an array of indices (url_indices) to specify character selection order
- Joining the selected characters to form a new string
- Concatenating with a base URL prefix to create the final result

This is essentially a string permutation/reordering operation based on index mapping.
