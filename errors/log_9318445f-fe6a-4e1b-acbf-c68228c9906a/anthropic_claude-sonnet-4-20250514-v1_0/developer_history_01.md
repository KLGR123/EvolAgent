    "description": "This is the initial step to analyze the image file for fractions and sample problems. I'm using GPT-4o Vision API to examine the image and extract all fractions that use forward slash notation (/) as well as identify and solve any sample problems present. The approach involves: (1) Verifying the image file exists and is in a supported format, (2) Encoding the image to base64 for API processing, (3) Creating a comprehensive prompt that asks GPT-4o to find all fractions with forward slash notation in order of appearance, (4) Requesting identification and solution of any sample problems, (5) Asking for a complete ordered list of all findings. The results will be saved to workspace/fraction_analysis_results.txt for further processing if needed. This establishes the foundation for creating the comprehensive list requested in the PLAN.",
