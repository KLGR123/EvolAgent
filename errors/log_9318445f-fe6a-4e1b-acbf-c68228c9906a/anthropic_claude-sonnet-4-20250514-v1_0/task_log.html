The task was to execute the Python script logic against the provided string array to generate a URL containing C++ source code, which has been successfully accomplished. The execution results show: (1) All 34 array elements were properly mapped and accessible, (2) The index array [33, 4, 8, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 23, 0, 26, 27, 28, 5, 30, 31, 32, 2] was used to select elements in the correct order, (3) The selected elements were joined to form &#x27;https://rosettacode.org/wiki/sorting_algorithms/Quicksort#C++&#x27;, (4) This was concatenated with the archive prefix to produce the final URL: &#x27;https://web.archive.org/web/20230609112831/https://rosettacode.org/wiki/sorting_algorithms/Quicksort#C++&#x27;. The script successfully adapted to the provided array structure without bounds issues and generated the resulting URL pointing to C++ Quicksort source code on Rosetta Code. No further development is needed as the **PLAN** objective has been fully achieved with 100% completion as confirmed by the tester.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Download the C++ source code from the URL https://web.archive.org/web/20230609112831/https://rosettacode.org/wiki/sorting_algorithms/Quicksort#C++ and save it to workspace/quicksort.cpp for compilation and execution.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully generated the URL containing C++ source code from the Python script execution, (2) We need to obtain the actual C++ code before we can compile and run it against the integer array [35, 12, 8, 99, 21, 5], (3) Expected outcome is to have the Quicksort C++ source code downloaded and ready for compilation, (4) This progresses toward the final goal of running the C++ code and calculating the sum of the third and fifth integers in the sorted array&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;**PLAN COMPLETION SUMMARY**: The task has been successfully completed by the previous developer. The objective was to download the C++ source code from the specified URL and save it to workspace/quicksort.cpp for compilation and execution, which has been fully accomplished.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF COMPLETED WORK**:\n1. **Successful URL Access**: The previous developer successfully fetched the webpage from the web archive URL (https://web.archive.org/web/20230609112831/https://rosettacode.org/wiki/sorting_algorithms/Quicksort#C++) with HTTP status 200 and processed 1,382,475 characters of content.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Code Extraction**: The implementation systematically analyzed 393 potential C++ code blocks from the Rosetta Code page, using multiple search patterns and scoring candidates based on C++ indicators like &#x27;#include&#x27;, &#x27;std::&#x27;, &#x27;template&lt;&#x27;, &#x27;quicksort&#x27;, &#x27;partition&#x27;, etc.\n\n3. **Optimal Code Selection**: The highest-scoring candidate (Score: 6/6) was selected - a professional C++ quicksort implementation featuring:\n   - Standard library includes (`&lt;iterator&gt;`, `&lt;algorithm&gt;`, `&lt;functional&gt;`)\n   - Template-based generic implementation\n   - Median-of-three pivot selection for optimal performance\n   - STL algorithms integration (`std::partition`)\n   - Comprehensive helper functions and operators\n   - 1,912 characters of well-structured code\n\n4. **File Management**: The C++ source code was successfully saved to `workspace/quicksort.cpp` (1,912 bytes) and verification confirmed the content integrity.\n\n**DELIVERABLE STATUS**: The quicksort.cpp file is ready for compilation and execution as required by the **PLAN**.

The ice cream product butterfat percentage calculation and federal compliance analysis has been thoroughly executed with comprehensive results.\n\n**Key accomplishments:**\n\n1. **Complete Butterfat Calculation**: Successfully calculated the actual butterfat percentage from the extracted nutritional data: 21g total fat per 144g serving = 14.6% butterfat content.\n\n2. **Federal Standard Comparison**: Accurately compared the product against the US federal minimum butterfat standard of 10% as established by FDA regulations and extracted from Wikipedia 2020 information.\n\n3. **Compliance Analysis**: Determined that the ice cream product EXCEEDS the federal standard by +4.6 percentage points, indicating full regulatory compliance.\n\n4. **Mathematical Verification**: Applied correct calculation methodology: (21g ÷ 144g) × 100 = 14.5833% = 14.6% (rounded to one decimal place as requested).\n\n5. **Answer Format Compliance**: Expressed the final answer exactly as requested in the TASK: **+4.6** (as +/- a number rounded to one decimal place).\n\n6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: All calculations, analysis, and supporting data have been saved to workspace files:\n   - `ice_cream_butterfat_compliance_analysis.json` (complete analysis with all calculations)\n   - `butterfat_analysis_summary.txt` (human-readable summary)\n   - Previous files containing federal standard research and product analysis\n\n**Final Result**: The ice cream product contains 14.6% butterfat, which is **+4.6 percentage points** above the US federal minimum standard of 10%. This indicates the product exceeds federal requirements for legal ice cream classification.\n\n**Answer**: +4.6\n\nThe PLAN objective has been fully achieved with accurate calculation of the actual butterfat percentage, proper comparison against the federal standard, and expression of the difference in the exact format requested.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;Task completed successfully.
