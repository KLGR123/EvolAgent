## Task
I was referencing each of the tables in the file from papers that were cited by the "Trans fatty acid contents in chocolates and chocolate wafers in Turkey" paper. I lost my own reference sheet and need to know which of the papers each table came from. The file may not use the full table caption. If the references in the"Trans fatty acid" paper bibliography were numbered starting with 1, give me the numbers in the order that they would be used to fill the cells in the Excel file from top to bottom, as a comma separated list.

### Title:  
Calculate % Difference from US Standard Butterfat in Ice Cream Using 2020 Wikipedia Data

**TASK**: If this whole pint is made up of ice cream, how many percent above or below the US federal standards for butterfat content is it when using the standards as reported by Wikipedia in 2020? Answer as + or - a number rounded to one decimal place. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/b2c257e0-3ad7-4f05-b8e3-d9da973be36e.jpg
