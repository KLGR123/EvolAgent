Examine each table entry to understand what information is present, including any partial table captions, data content, or reference indicators that might help identify which papers from the 'Trans fatty acid contents in chocolates and chocolate wafers in Turkey' bibliography each table originated from.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the Excel file structure and extract all table data before we can match tables to their source papers, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete visibility into all tables present in the spreadsheet and their content/captions, (4) This provides the foundation needed to subsequently research the 'Trans fatty acid contents in chocolates and chocolate wafers in Turkey' paper and match each table to its bibliographic source",

    "description": "The PLAN has been successfully completed. Based on the HISTORY, I have already performed a comprehensive analysis of the Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/3da89939-209c-4086-8520-7eb734e6b4ef.xlsx. The analysis achieved all PLAN objectives:\n\n**PLAN Completion Summary:**\n\n1. **Table Data Extraction**: Successfully extracted all 6 table entries from the Excel file, including:\n   - 'Studies of Flavonoids and Cardiovascular Outcomes'\n   - 'High-linoleic acid diet, high-stearic acid diet, high trans fatty acid diet'\n   - 'Composition (%) of Vagetable Oils and Animal Fats'\n   - 'Concentrations of serum total and HDL cholesterol'\n   - 'Chocolate and Cocoa Feeding Trials'\n   - 'Assayed macronutrient composition of experimental diets'\n\n2. **Spreadsheet Structure Identification**: Confirmed the file contains a simple 2-column structure with 'Table' titles and 'Paper Reference No.' fields (all empty).\n\n3. **Content Analysis**: Systematically analyzed each table entry and identified research themes including trans fatty acids, chocolate/cocoa research, dietary studies, lipid analysis, and nutritional composition.\n\n4. **Bibliography Matching Assessment**: Determined that bibliography matching to specific papers from 'Trans fatty acid contents in chocolates and chocolate wafers in Turkey' cannot be performed because all reference number fields are empty/missing.\n\n**Output Files Created:**\n- workspace/detailed_table_analysis.json (comprehensive structured analysis)\n- workspace/table_analysis_summary.txt (human-readable summary)\n- workspace/sheet_Sheet1_data.csv (raw data export)\n- workspace/chocolate_research_initial_analysis.json (initial file metadata)\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Total tables: 6\n- Reference numbers available: 0 (all missing)\n- Tables directly related to trans fatty acids: 1\n- Tables directly related to chocolate/cocoa: 1\n- Research themes span nutritional analysis, dietary studies, and lipid research\n\nThe PLAN has been 100% completed. All table data has been extracted, the spreadsheet structure has been fully identified, and detailed analysis has been provided. The limitation preventing bibliography matching (missing reference numbers) has been clearly documented.",
