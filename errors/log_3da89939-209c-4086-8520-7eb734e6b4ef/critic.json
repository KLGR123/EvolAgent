  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine reference numbers from the 'Trans fatty acid contents in chocolates and chocolate wafers in Turkey' paper bibliography that correspond to 6 table titles in an Excel file, ordered top to bottom. All three members successfully extracted the same 6 table titles from the Excel file: (1) Studies of Flavonoids and Cardiovascular Outcomes, (2) High-linoleic acid diet, high-stearic acid diet, high trans fatty acid diet, (3) Composition (%) of Vegetable Oils and Animal Fats, (4) Concentrations of serum total and HDL cholesterol, (5) Chocolate and Cocoa Feeding Trials, (6) Assayed macronutrient composition of experimental diets. Member 1 evaluation: Downloaded the target paper successfully, extracted 6 references from bibliography, but provided inconsistent final answer 'N/A,1,1,N/A,N/A,1' with limited matching rationale - assigned multiple tables to same reference without clear justification. Member 2 evaluation: Also successfully located and downloaded the paper, extracted complete 21-reference bibliography (more comprehensive than Member 1), performed systematic cross-referencing with keyword matching and semantic similarity scoring, provided detailed matching rationale for each assignment, resulted in answer '2,8,14,18,18,7' with clear scoring methodology. Member 3 evaluation: Identified the correct paper but failed to access the bibliography due to authentication barriers, could not complete the matching task despite comprehensive alternative access attempts. Cross-analysis reveals Member 2 had superior methodology with 21 references vs Member 1's 6 references, suggesting Member 2 accessed more complete bibliography. Member 2's systematic scoring approach (Reference #2 for flavonoids/cardiovascular, #8 for trans fatty acids, #14 for oils/fats composition, #18 for cholesterol/lipoproteins and feeding trials, #7 for experimental diets) demonstrates logical content-based matching. Convergence analysis shows Members 1 and 2 both successfully accessed the paper but with different bibliography completeness. Final answer validation: Member 2's approach with 21 references and systematic scoring provides most reliable foundation for matching decisions.",
