    "plan": "Search for and access the Wikipedia page on 'Principle of double effect' to locate its complete revision history. Extract comprehensive information about all edits made to this page from its creation to present, focusing specifically on identifying when images of St. Thomas Aquinas were first added. Analyze the revision history to find the earliest edit that included a picture, photograph, or image of St. Thomas Aquinas on the page.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the Wikipedia page for 'Principle of double effect' and access its complete edit history to track image additions, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the page's revision history and identify the specific date when a St. Thomas Aquinas image was first added, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement to determine when the first picture of St. Thomas Aquinas appeared on this Wikipedia page, which we can then format as DD/MM/YYYY.",
