  "final_answer": "No picture of St. Thomas Aquinas has ever been added to the Wikipedia page on the Principle of double effect",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine the specific date when a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas was first added to the Wikipedia 'Principle of double effect' page, requiring DD/MM/YYYY format. Individual evaluation reveals significant contradictions: Member 1 claims the earliest addition was 05/05/2009 when user Koavf added a Thomas Aquinas category (not an image), but acknowledges this was category addition rather than image addition. Member 2 conducted comprehensive analysis using multiple detection patterns and definitively concluded NO images of St. Thomas Aquinas have ever existed on this page - finding zero images of any kind across 436 revisions from 2003-2025. Member 3 claims images were added on 11/09/2015 via {{Thomas Aquinas}} template by user Smetanahue. Critical contradiction analysis: Members 1 and 3 provide specific dates but Member 1 admits finding category addition rather than images, while Member 3 claims template addition introduced images. Member 2's methodology appears most rigorous - conducting deep content analysis with 6 different image detection patterns, analyzing all 19 templates, and finding zero images throughout entire page history. Cross-verification assessment: Member 2's finding that the page is text-only aligns with the philosophical nature of 'Principle of double effect' as an abstract concept page. The contradiction between Members 1/3 (claiming image additions) and Member 2 (no images ever) requires resolution through methodological soundness evaluation. Member 2's systematic approach using multiple detection methods and comprehensive template analysis provides highest confidence. Final determination: The evidence strongly supports that no pictures of St. Thomas Aquinas have ever been added to this Wikipedia page.",
