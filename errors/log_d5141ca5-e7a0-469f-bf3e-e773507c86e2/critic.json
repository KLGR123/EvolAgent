  "final_answer": "No St. Thomas Aquinas picture was ever added to the Principle of double effect Wikipedia page",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine the specific date when a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas was first added to the Wikipedia page on 'Principle of double effect', formatted as DD/MM/YYYY. Individual member evaluation reveals a critical contradiction: Members 1 and 2 both claim St. Thomas Aquinas images were first added on September 11, 2015 (11/09/2015) via a '{{Thomas Aquinas}}' template by user Smetanahue in revision ID 680565228. Both used comprehensive methodologies analyzing all 436 revisions and employed content-based analysis of wiki markup. However, Member 3 conducted equally thorough analysis of the same 436 revisions using similar methodology but reached the opposite conclusion - that no St. Thomas Aquinas images have ever been added to the page. Cross-analysis of methodologies: All three members used appropriate Wikipedia API approaches, analyzed complete revision histories, and employed content-based analysis rather than relying solely on edit summaries. The critical divergence centers on interpretation of the '{{Thomas Aquinas}}' template. Resolution analysis: A {{Thomas Aquinas}} template typically creates a navigation box or infobox that may contain an image of Aquinas, but this is not the same as directly adding 'a picture of St. Thomas Aquinas' to the page content. Member 3's analysis specifically examined the current page and found zero images of any kind, which suggests the template either doesn't include an image or was subsequently removed. Given that Member 3's verification of current page content shows no images whatsoever, and their methodology was equally rigorous, their conclusion that no picture was ever added appears most accurate. The template addition identified by Members 1 and 2 may not constitute adding 'a picture' in the direct sense required by the task.",
