# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for and access the latest 2022 Lego English Wikipedia article to identify and count all images present in the article. Use web search to locate the Wikipedia page for 'Lego' or 'The Lego Group', then examine the article content to systematically count all embedded images, including photographs, diagrams, logos, and any other visual media elements that appear within the article text and sections.

## Description
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to locate the specific 2022 version of the Lego Wikipedia article to ensure we're analyzing the correct timeframe, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to access the Wikipedia page and identify all visual content for systematic counting, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement to determine the total number of images in the latest 2022 Lego English Wikipedia article.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 5: Analyze 2022 Legume Wikipedia Logs for Content Violations and Decode ‘R’ Policy Meaning

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Wikipedia community management: Auditing the edit history of high-traffic plant taxonomy pages (like “Legume”) to flag all vandalism, spam, or unsourced content removals before December 2022 and ensure policy compliance.
- Academic research on collaborative editing: Extracting detailed rollback summaries and policy references from the Legume page’s 2022 logs to analyze how “No Original Research” (NOR) and “Verifiability” (V) issues evolve in botanical articles.
- Data journalism investigation: Mining the public history of articles on crop nutrition to identify when and why nutritional claims were removed or reverted, helping reporters document misinformation trends in legumes.
- Legal and copyright compliance review: Systematically collecting all entries marked “deleted,” “removed,” or “rollback” from the Legume page to verify that no copyrighted text was inadvertently retained in public edits during 2022.
- Non-profit conservation monitoring: Automating a monthly scan of endangered plant species pages (including legumes) to detect policy violations and generate alerts for curators when unsourced or promotional content appears.
- Bot development for policy enforcement: Feeding the parsed 2022 edit summaries into a custom moderation bot that recognizes “RV,” “SPAM,” and “VAND” tags to automatically revert or flag noncompliant edits in ecology-related articles.
- Digital literacy education: Leveraging real flagged entries from the Legume page to teach students about the three core Wikipedia policies (NPOV, V, NOR) and how to spot and document content violations in collaborative platforms.
- SEO and brand management: Reviewing promotional content removals on corporate-sponsored legume pages to understand why certain claims were reverted, guiding marketing teams to craft compliance-ready copy.

### Development Step 8: Analyzing 2022 Legume Wikipedia Log Violations: Violation Type and “R” Policy Definition

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Regulatory compliance audits of pharmaceutical Wikipedia pages to verify source reliability and detect No Original Research violations before drug approval submissions
- Media watchdog automated monitoring of political biography edits to flag Neutral Point of View breaches and biased language patterns
- Legal discovery workflows extracting historical revert (RV) actions and Reliable Sources disputes in trademark-related Wikipedia articles for litigation support
- Academic research data pipelines aggregating policy violation incidents across STEM entries to analyze trends in misinformation and editorial bias
- NGO crisis response teams tracking Verifiability breaches and unverified health claims on disaster-related Wikipedia pages to ensure accurate public information
- Corporate brand management platforms monitoring unauthorized promotional edits in product and competitor Wikipedia articles to safeguard brand integrity
- Wikipedia training programs leveraging real-world violation case studies from the Legume page to educate new editors on NPOV, Verifiability, and No Original Research policies

### Development Step 7: Legume Wikipedia 2022 Logs: Identify Violated Content Type and Define “R” in Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Nonprofit Wikipedia oversight reporting: Volunteers automate extraction of 2022 content violations on the Legume page to create training materials that improve community guideline compliance.
- Media fact‐checking workflow: A newsroom integrates the solution to flag policy‐violating edits on botanical topics before December 2022 as part of their verification pipeline.
- Corporate knowledge management audit: An enterprise mirrors public Wikipedia logs into its internal wiki and uses this code to detect and remove content that breaches core policy standards.
- Academic research on online governance: Scholars parse violation incidents and policy interpretations from Legume’s logs to quantify trends in user‐generated content moderation for a peer‐reviewed study.
- AI training data curation: A machine learning engineer filters out any text from pre‐December 2022 Wikipedia dumps that violated core policies, ensuring only reliable, policy‐compliant data is used.
- Digital archival quality audit: A library’s digital preservation team runs the script on archived Wikipedia snapshots to verify adherence to NPOV, Verifiability, and No Original Research policies.
- Legal risk assessment: A consultancy analyzes public log violations for trademark or defamation risks on the Legume page, advising clients on potential exposure from user edits.

### Development Step 6: Identify 2022 Legume Wikipedia Content Violations Before December and the ‘R’ in Three Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate knowledge base compliance auditing: scanning internal wiki logs for policy breaches (e.g., NPOV, Verifiability, NOR) and automatically generating violation reports
- Legal team wiki content review for copyright infringement: parsing edit histories to identify removed or reverted content due to alleged copyright violations in 2022
- Academic research on collaborative content governance: analyzing Wikipedia talk pages and revision logs to study policy violation patterns and their resolutions
- Non-profit NGO media monitoring: tracking changes on advocacy-related Wikipedia pages to detect vandalism or biased edits and ensure neutrality
- Automated documentation pipeline in software development: integrating violation scanning to flag policy breaches in project documentation before publication
- Government agency digital archive auditing: reviewing web archive captures to identify and document policy violations on public information pages for regulatory compliance
- Media company brand monitoring: analyzing Wikipedia page edits and removal incidents to detect vandalism or misinformation about company products and mitigate reputational risks
- University academic integrity assessment: auditing student-contributed wiki revisions to enforce "No Original Research" policy and Verifiability guidelines in coursework

### Development Step 2: Legume Wikipedia 2022 Content Violations: Identify Violated Content, Core Policies, ‘R’ Definition

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated moderation workflow for agricultural wiki: scan the 2022 edit history of the “Legume” article to flag violations of Neutral Point of View, Verifiability, and “R” (Reliable sourcing) policies and alert community administrators.
- Academic research on content censorship: analyze public logs from January–November 2022 for the Legume page to quantify removals of unsourced material and correlate them with the three core Wikipedia policies in a peer-reviewed study.
- Corporate intranet documentation audit: apply the HTML/JSON inspection pipeline to internal policy pages, detect unauthorized removals or reverts, and enforce company information governance standards after each quarterly review.
- Digital preservation tool for libraries: monitor policy breaches and vandalism on taxonomy and species articles, record every content removal incident through 2022, and archive original revisions for long-term access.
- Investigative journalism dashboard: ingest Wikipedia edit histories for high-traffic science pages (e.g., Legume) to identify sudden spikes in “removed” or “vandalism” mentions during key events and support data-driven reporting.
- NGO transparency reporting: track policy infractions across public knowledge platforms, generate monthly summaries of content violations in agricultural entries, and publish compliance metrics for donors and stakeholders.
- Government open-data monitoring: continuously inspect municipal and environmental wiki pages for unauthorized edits or policy violations, trigger security tickets for high-priority incidents, and maintain public trust in service documentation.
