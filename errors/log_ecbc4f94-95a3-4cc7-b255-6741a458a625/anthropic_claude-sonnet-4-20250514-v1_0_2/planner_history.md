    "plan": "Search for and access the latest 2022 version of the Lego Wikipedia article on English Wikipedia. Use targeted web searches or Wikipedia's revision history to locate the specific version of the Lego article as it appeared at the end of 2022. Once found, analyze the article content to identify and count all images present in that version, including photographs, diagrams, logos, and any other visual media embedded within the article.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific 2022 version of the Lego Wikipedia article before counting images, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this image analysis task, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the correct article version from late 2022 and extract comprehensive image data, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement to determine the exact number of images in the latest 2022 version of the English Wikipedia Lego article.',
