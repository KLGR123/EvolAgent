Extract the complete page content and systematically count all images present in the article, including inline images, gallery images, infobox images, and any other visual media elements. Identify each image by analyzing the page's HTML structure, wikitext markup, or API response to provide an accurate total count of images in the 2022 version of the Lego Wikipedia page.",
