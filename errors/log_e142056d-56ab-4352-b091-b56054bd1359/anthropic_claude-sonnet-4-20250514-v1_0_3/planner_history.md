    "plan": "Analyze the game show coin distribution problem to determine all valid ways the host can place 30 coins across three boxes given the constraints: (1) one box must contain at least 2 coins, (2) one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. Then determine Bob's optimal guessing strategy that maximizes his minimum guaranteed winnings, considering that he wins coins equal to his guess only if his guess is less than or equal to the actual number of coins in each box.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) This is a complex optimization problem requiring systematic analysis of valid coin distributions and optimal guessing strategies, (2) No previous analysis has been conducted on this game theory problem, (3) Expected outcome is to identify all possible coin arrangements, determine Bob's best strategy, and calculate the minimum guaranteed winnings, (4) This directly addresses the TASK by finding the optimal strategy and minimum winnings Bob can achieve in this constrained game scenario.",

    "description": "The game show coin distribution analysis is complete and fully addresses all PLAN objectives. The comprehensive solution found 13 valid coin distributions using the systematic algebraic approach x, x+6, 24-2x, verified all constraints are satisfied, and determined Bob's optimal guaranteed strategy is to guess 0 coins (guaranteeing 0 coins regardless of host's choice due to distributions containing 0-coin boxes). The analysis includes detailed risk vs reward evaluation showing that while higher guesses offer better expected values (up to 1.85 coins for guess=3), they also risk total loss. Key findings: (1) Valid distributions range from [0,6,24] to [8,8,14] coins, (2) Two critical distributions [0,6,24] and [0,12,18] limit Bob's guaranteed winnings to 0, (3) Bob faces classic risk-reward tradeoff between guaranteed returns vs expected value, (4) Complete mathematical verification confirms all distributions satisfy both constraints. Final comprehensive results saved to workspace/final_comprehensive_analysis.json with all mathematical proofs, strategic insights, and detailed breakdowns for future reference.",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. The developer has conducted a comprehensive analysis of Bob's game show optimization problem and determined the definitive answer. The analysis found 13 valid coin distributions that satisfy both constraints: (1) at least one box must contain â‰¥2 coins, and (2) one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. Using systematic algebraic modeling with the form [x, x+6, 24-2x], all valid distributions were identified ranging from [0,6,24] to [8,8,14]. The critical finding is that two distributions contain boxes with 0 coins: [0,6,24] and [0,12,18]. Since Bob wins nothing if he guesses higher than the actual number of coins in any box, and the host can choose any valid distribution, Bob's optimal guaranteed strategy is to guess 0 coins for all three boxes. This ensures he wins 0 coins regardless of which distribution the host selects, making this his minimum guaranteed winnings. While higher guesses offer better expected values (up to 1.85 coins for guess=3), they risk total loss when the host selects distributions with 0-coin boxes. Final answer: $0 (Bob's minimum guaranteed winnings using optimal strategy).",
