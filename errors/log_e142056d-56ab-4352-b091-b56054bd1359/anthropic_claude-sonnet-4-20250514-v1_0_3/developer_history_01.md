    "description": "Starting the analysis of the coin distribution game by systematically finding all valid ways to distribute 30 coins across three boxes. The code generates all possible combinations and filters them based on the two constraints: (1) at least one box must contain at least 2 coins, and (2) one box must contain exactly 6 more coins than another box. This establishes the foundation for determining Bob's optimal strategy by first understanding all possible game scenarios he might face. The results are saved to workspace for further analysis of Bob's optimal guessing strategy in the next iteration.",

The script successfully loaded and analyzed both saved analysis files, providing a complete solution summary with detailed verification. The output shows: (1) 12 valid distributions were correctly identified and all satisfy both constraints, (2) Bob's optimal strategy is to guess 0 coins with 0 minimum guaranteed winnings, (3) Mathematical verification confirms this is optimal because two distributions contain boxes with 0 coins, making any positive guess risky, (4) Alternative strategy analysis shows all positive guesses also have 0 minimum guaranteed winnings. The analysis includes comprehensive verification of constraints, winning mechanisms, and mathematical proofs. Three well-organized files were generated: distribution analysis, strategy analysis, and complete solution summary. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all objectives fully achieved with thorough verification. The solution correctly determines that Bob cannot guarantee any positive winnings due to the existence of distributions with 0-coin boxes, making his optimal strategy to guess 0 coins.

    "description": "The coin distribution game analysis has been completed successfully and comprehensively. All objectives from the PLAN have been achieved: (1) All 12 valid ways to distribute 30 coins across three boxes have been identified, satisfying both constraints (at least one box with ≥2 coins, and one box containing exactly 6 more coins than another), (2) Bob's optimal guessing strategy has been determined through systematic analysis of minimum guaranteed winnings for all possible guess values, (3) The mathematical proof shows Bob's optimal strategy is to guess 0 coins with 0 minimum guaranteed winnings, because two distributions ([0,6,24] and [0,12,18]) contain boxes with 0 coins, making any positive guess risky. The analysis includes comprehensive verification, alternative strategy evaluation, and complete documentation. Three detailed files have been generated: workspace/coin_distribution_analysis.json (distribution analysis), workspace/bob_optimal_strategy.json (strategy analysis), and workspace/complete_solution_summary.json (comprehensive summary). The solution is mathematically rigorous and addresses all aspects of the PLAN with thorough verification and explanation.",
