    "feedback": "Execution successful but reveals a critical logical error - Code ran without errors and completed Bob's strategy analysis, but the results show a fundamental flaw in the approach. All three strategies (Choose Box 1, 2, or 3) yield identical minimum guaranteed winnings of 0 coins, making the 'optimal' choice arbitrary. This occurs because the analysis treats each box position independently, but the real insight should be that Bob needs a smarter strategy than just picking a fixed box position. The code correctly identified 66 arrangements and performed minimax analysis, but the conclusion that Bob can only guarantee 0 coins suggests the strategy space wasn't fully explored. **PLAN** alignment: 75% complete - the technical implementation is sound, but the strategic analysis may be missing key insights like choosing based on visible information or using randomized strategies. Recommendation: Investigate whether Bob has any information about the boxes (like their relative positions or any distinguishing features) that could inform a better strategy, or consider if the problem requires a different approach than fixed position selection.",

    "description": 'Conducting advanced strategy analysis beyond simple fixed-box selection to find Bob\'s truly optimal approach. This code explores multiple sophisticated strategies: (1) Mixed randomized strategies where Bob chooses each box with equal probability, (2) "Choose middle value" strategy where Bob selects the box with the median coin amount, (3) "Avoid minimum" strategy where Bob randomly chooses between non-minimum boxes, and (4) Theoretical upper bound analysis. The analysis compares minimum guaranteed winnings, average expected winnings, and strategic feasibility for each approach. This addresses the tester\'s feedback about the limitation of fixed-position strategies and explores whether Bob can use observable information about the coin distributions to make better decisions. The goal is to find a strategy that truly maximizes Bob\'s minimum guaranteed winnings beyond the 0-coin guarantee of fixed strategies.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and provided a comprehensive advanced strategy analysis that significantly improves upon the previous approach. The analysis correctly identified that all fixed-box strategies only guarantee 0 coins, but then explored sophisticated alternatives including mixed strategies, middle-value selection, and minimum-avoidance approaches. Key findings: (1) 'Avoid Minimum' strategy provides the best practical minimum guarantee of 11.50 coins, (2) Mixed strategy guarantees exactly 10.00 coins, (3) Middle-value strategy guarantees 6.00 coins. However, there's a logical error in the final conclusion - the code incorrectly selected 'Choose Maximum (theoretical)' as optimal, which requires perfect information that Bob doesn't have. The truly optimal feasible strategy should be 'Avoid Minimum' with 11.50 coins guaranteed. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - excellent analysis of distribution patterns and strategy comparison, but needs correction of the final optimal strategy selection to focus on practically implementable approaches rather than theoretical upper bounds.",

    "description": "Correcting the logical error from the previous analysis by properly distinguishing between practical strategies that Bob can actually implement versus theoretical strategies requiring perfect information. This code first inspects the comprehensive analysis file structure, then separates practical from theoretical strategies. It correctly identifies 'Avoid Minimum' as the optimal practical strategy (guaranteeing 11.50 coins vs 0 coins for fixed strategies), provides detailed implementation steps, and compares it against the theoretical upper bound. The analysis explains why this strategy works: Bob can observe the coin amounts, identify the minimum, and choose randomly between non-minimum boxes, thus exploiting the constraint structure that forces inequality between boxes. This provides the definitive, implementable solution to maximize Bob's minimum guaranteed winnings.",

The script properly separated practical strategies (that Bob can actually implement) from theoretical strategies (requiring information Bob doesn't have), and correctly identified 'Avoid Minimum' as the optimal practical strategy with 11.50 coins minimum guaranteed winnings. The analysis provides comprehensive verification showing this strategy achieves 95.8% efficiency compared to the theoretical maximum, detailed implementation steps, and clear reasoning about why avoiding the minimum value leverages the constraint structure. The output includes proper strategy ranking, sample verification with coin arrangements, and saves the corrected solution to 'workspace/final_corrected_solution.json'. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - both major components are fully addressed: (1) all 66 valid coin distributions identified, and (2) Bob's optimal strategy determined with clear implementation guidance.
