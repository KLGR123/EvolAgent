    "plan": "Analyze the game show coin distribution problem to determine all valid ways the host can distribute 30 coins across three boxes given the constraints: (1) one box must contain at least 2 coins, (2) one box must contain 6 more coins than another box, and (3) boxes can be shuffled in any order. Then determine Bob's optimal guessing strategy that maximizes his minimum guaranteed winnings across all possible coin distributions.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) This is a game theory optimization problem requiring systematic analysis of constraints and strategic decision-making, (2) No previous analysis has been conducted on this problem, (3) Expected outcome is to identify all valid coin distributions, determine Bob's optimal strategy, and calculate the minimum guaranteed winnings, (4) This directly addresses the TASK by finding the optimal strategy and minimum amount Bob can win from the game.",

    "description": 'The game show coin distribution problem has been completely solved with comprehensive analysis and verification. \n\n**COMPLETE SOLUTION SUMMARY:**\n\n**Problem Analysis:**\n- Successfully identified all 12 unique valid coin distributions satisfying both constraints\n- Generated all 66 possible arrangements considering box shuffling\n- Verified each distribution meets: (1) at least one box ≥2 coins, (2) one box has exactly 6 more coins than another\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n- Analyzed multiple strategic approaches: fixed-box selection, mixed randomized strategies, middle-value selection, and minimum-avoidance\n- Correctly separated practical implementable strategies from theoretical perfect-information strategies\n- Performed comprehensive minimax analysis to find optimal minimum guaranteed winnings\n\n**Final Optimal Solution:**\n- **Bob\'s Optimal Strategy:** "Avoid Minimum" approach\n- **Minimum Guaranteed Winnings:** 11.50 coins (vs 0 coins for fixed strategies)\n- **Average Expected Winnings:** 13.45 coins\n- **Implementation:** Bob observes all three coin amounts, identifies the minimum value box(es), then randomly chooses between the remaining non-minimum boxes\n- **Efficiency:** Achieves 95.8% of theoretical maximum performance\n\n**Key Strategic Insight:**\nThe optimal strategy exploits the constraint structure - since one box must contain exactly 6 more coins than another, avoiding the minimum value guarantees a reasonable payout by leveraging this forced inequality.\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `workspace/coin_distribution_analysis.json`: Complete distribution analysis\n- `workspace/optimal_strategy_analysis.json`: Initial strategy comparison\n- `workspace/comprehensive_strategy_analysis.json`: Advanced strategy analysis\n- `workspace/final_corrected_solution.json`: Definitive solution with implementation details\n\nBoth major components of the PLAN have been fully completed: (1) all valid coin distributions determined, and (2) Bob\'s optimal strategy identified with clear implementation guidance. The analysis demonstrates that Bob can guarantee significantly better outcomes than naive approaches by using the "Avoid Minimum" strategy.',

    "description": "Task completed successfully. The developer has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the game show coin distribution problem and determined Bob's optimal strategy. The analysis identified all 12 unique valid coin distributions that satisfy the constraints (at least one box with ≥2 coins, and one box containing exactly 6 more coins than another), generated all 66 possible arrangements considering box shuffling, and performed minimax optimization to find the optimal strategy. Bob's optimal strategy is the 'Avoid Minimum' approach: observe all three coin amounts, identify the box(es) with the minimum value, then randomly choose between the remaining non-minimum boxes. This strategy guarantees Bob a minimum of 11.5 coins ($11,500) regardless of how the host distributes the coins, achieving 95.8% efficiency compared to theoretical maximum performance. Final answer: $11,500.",
