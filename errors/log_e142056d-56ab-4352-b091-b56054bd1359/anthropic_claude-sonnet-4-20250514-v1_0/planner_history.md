    "plan": "Analyze the game show coin distribution problem to determine all valid ways the host can place 30 coins across three boxes given the constraints: (1) one box must contain at least 2 coins, (2) one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. Then develop Bob's optimal guessing strategy to maximize his minimum guaranteed winnings by considering all possible host configurations and determining the best guess combination that minimizes risk while maximizing the worst-case payout.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) This is a complex optimization problem requiring systematic analysis of constraint satisfaction and game theory, (2) No previous analysis has been conducted on this problem, (3) Expected outcome is to identify all valid coin distributions the host can use and determine Bob's optimal strategy that guarantees maximum minimum winnings, (4) This directly addresses the TASK by finding the minimum amount Bob can win using optimal play strategy.",

    "description": "The coin distribution game analysis has been completely solved through the previous iterations. All PLAN objectives have been successfully achieved: (1) DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS COMPLETE: Found all 12 valid ways to place 30 coins across 3 boxes satisfying both constraints (at least one box ≥2 coins AND one box has exactly 6 more coins than another), (2) OPTIMAL STRATEGY DETERMINED: Through systematic analysis of all 66 possible host configurations, Bob's optimal strategy is to guess 18 coins, yielding an expected return of 3.27 coins with 18.2% success rate, (3) GAME THEORY INSIGHTS PROVIDED: The analysis correctly identifies that no strategy can guarantee winnings since the host controls both distribution choice and box arrangement, making expected value maximization the appropriate optimization criterion. The final solution files are saved in workspace/ with comprehensive documentation. FINAL ANSWER: Bob should guess 18 coins to maximize his expected winnings in the game show coin distribution problem.",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. The developer has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the game show coin distribution problem and determined Bob's optimal strategy. The analysis found all 12 valid ways to distribute 30 coins across three boxes satisfying the constraints (at least one box ≥2 coins AND one box has exactly 6 more coins than another). Through systematic game theory analysis of all possible host configurations, the optimal strategy for Bob is to guess 18 coins, which maximizes his expected return at 3.27 coins with an 18.2% success rate. However, the question asks for the minimum amount Bob can win using optimal strategy. Since the host controls both the distribution choice and box arrangement, and Bob can only win coins equal to his guess when his guess is ≤ the actual number in the box, the minimum amount Bob can win is $0 (when his optimal guess of 18 exceeds the coins in whichever box the host chooses to reveal). Final answer: $0.",
