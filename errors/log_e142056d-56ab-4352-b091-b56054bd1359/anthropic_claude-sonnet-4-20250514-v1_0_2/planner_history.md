    "plan": "Analyze the game show coin distribution problem to determine all valid ways the host can distribute 30 coins across three boxes given the constraints: (1) one box must contain at least 2 coins, (2) one box must contain 6 more coins than another box, and (3) boxes can be shuffled in any order. Then determine Bob's optimal guessing strategy that maximizes his minimum guaranteed winnings across all possible distributions.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to systematically identify all valid coin distributions that satisfy the given constraints before determining optimal strategy, (2) No previous analysis has been conducted on this game theory problem, (3) Expected outcome is to enumerate all possible distributions and then calculate Bob's optimal guessing strategy that maximizes his worst-case scenario winnings, (4) This directly addresses the TASK by finding the minimum amount Bob can guarantee to win using optimal play",

    "description": "The game show coin distribution problem has been completely solved. The analysis successfully identified all 12 valid ways to distribute 30 coins across three boxes satisfying the constraints: (1) at least one box contains ≥2 coins, and (2) one box contains exactly 6 more coins than another. The valid distributions are: [0,6,24], [0,12,18], [1,7,22], [2,8,20], [2,11,17], [3,9,18], [4,10,16], [5,11,14], [6,9,15], [6,12,12], [7,10,13], and [8,8,14]. These create 66 total possible arrangements when considering all permutations. For Bob's optimal strategy analysis, the code used game theory principles to determine that Bob's maximum guaranteed minimum winnings is 0 coins. This is because distributions [0,6,24] and [0,12,18] contain boxes with 0 coins, and the adversarial host can always arrange these distributions so that whichever box Bob chooses contains 0 coins. Therefore, all three strategies (always pick Box 1, Box 2, or Box 3) are equivalent and guarantee exactly 0 coins minimum. The complete analysis with verification has been saved to workspace files: 'coin_distribution_analysis.json', 'optimal_strategy_analysis.json', and 'corrected_strategy_analysis.json'. The PLAN has been 100% completed with both mathematical rigor and game-theoretic correctness confirmed.",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. The developer has conducted a comprehensive game theory analysis of Bob's coin guessing game and determined the optimal strategy. The analysis identified all 12 valid ways to distribute 30 coins across three boxes satisfying the constraints: (1) at least one box contains ≥2 coins, and (2) one box contains exactly 6 more coins than another box. These distributions create 66 total possible arrangements when considering permutations. The key finding is that distributions like [0,6,24] and [0,12,18] contain boxes with 0 coins, and since the adversarial host can shuffle the boxes in any order, the host can always ensure that whichever box Bob chooses contains 0 coins in the worst-case scenario. Therefore, using game theory principles for adversarial games, Bob's optimal strategy guarantees a minimum of 0 coins regardless of which guessing approach he uses. Final answer: $0 (zero dollars) is the minimum amount Bob can win using optimal strategy.",
