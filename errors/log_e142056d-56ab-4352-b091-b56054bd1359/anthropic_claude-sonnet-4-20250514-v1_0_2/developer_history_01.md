    "description": "Starting the analysis by finding all valid coin distributions that satisfy both constraints. I'm systematically checking all possible ways to distribute 30 coins across 3 boxes, verifying that: (1) at least one box has ≥2 coins, and (2) one box has exactly 6 more coins than another. This establishes the foundation for determining Bob's optimal strategy by first understanding all possible game scenarios the host could create. The code generates all valid distributions, removes duplicates, and analyzes the frequency of different coin amounts to understand the problem structure.",

The script successfully identified all 12 valid coin distributions that satisfy both constraints, verified each distribution's compliance, and performed frequency analysis of coin amounts. The output shows comprehensive results including the valid distributions ranging from [0,6,24] to [8,8,14], frequency analysis showing coins 6, 8, and 12 appear most frequently (25% each), and saved detailed results to 'workspace/coin_distribution_analysis.json'. PLAN alignment: ~40% complete - successfully found all valid distributions but still needs Bob's optimal strategy analysis.

    "feedback": "Execution failed - Code crashed with a ValueError at line 89 due to a string formatting issue. The error occurred when trying to format coin amounts from the frequency distribution data - the code attempted to use 'd' format specifier on string keys instead of integers. The script successfully loaded the analysis file, displayed the 12 valid distributions correctly, and started the strategy evaluation (showing conservative strategies worked), but failed when processing the frequency-based analysis section. PLAN alignment: ~60% complete - the systematic search for optimal strategy was not reached due to the crash. Recommended fix: Convert the coin_frequency dictionary keys from strings to integers when loading from JSON, or modify the format string to handle string keys properly. The core strategy analysis logic appears sound and should work once this data type issue is resolved.",

    "description": "Fixed the data type issue by converting string keys to integers when processing the frequency distribution data from the JSON file. Now implementing the complete optimal strategy analysis using game theory principles. The code systematically tests different guessing strategies using the minimax approach - finding the strategy that maximizes Bob's minimum guaranteed winnings across all possible host choices. This addresses the core game theory problem where Bob needs to protect against the worst-case scenario. The analysis includes conservative strategies, frequency-based approaches, and a comprehensive systematic search across reasonable guess ranges (0-15 coins). The solution identifies the optimal strategy, analyzes its performance against each distribution, and provides detailed worst-case analysis to explain why this strategy is optimal.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the comprehensive game theory analysis as required by the PLAN. The script successfully fixed the data type issue from the previous attempt, loaded all 12 valid distributions, and performed systematic strategy evaluation using multiple approaches (conservative, frequency-based, and exhaustive search). The analysis tested 4,096 different strategies and identified the optimal minimax strategy: Bob should guess [5, 6, 12] to guarantee at least 18 coins regardless of the host's choice. The output shows detailed performance analysis against each distribution, identifies 16 alternative strategies achieving the same optimal minimum, and provides comprehensive worst-case analysis. The results demonstrate that 7 distributions yield the minimum 18 coins while 5 distributions yield 23 coins. PLAN alignment: 100% complete - all requirements have been fulfilled including finding all valid distributions, determining Bob's optimal strategy, and analyzing the game theory aspects.

    "description": "The game show coin distribution problem has been completely solved. The analysis successfully identified all 12 valid distributions that satisfy both constraints: (1) at least one box must contain ≥2 coins, and (2) one box must contain exactly 6 more coins than another box. Using game theory principles, specifically the minimax strategy, the optimal solution for Bob has been determined: he should guess [5, 6, 12] coins across the three boxes. This strategy guarantees Bob will win at least 18 coins regardless of which valid distribution the host chooses, with an expected average of 20.1 coins. The analysis tested 4,096 different strategies and found 16 strategies that achieve the same optimal minimum of 18 coins. Detailed results including performance against each distribution, worst-case analysis, and alternative strategies have been saved to 'workspace/optimal_strategy_analysis.json'. The solution demonstrates that 7 distributions yield the minimum 18 coins (worst-case scenarios) while 5 distributions yield 23 coins (best-case scenarios), confirming the robustness of the minimax approach.",
