  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine the minimum amount Bob can win using optimal strategy in a coin guessing game with 30 coins distributed across 3 boxes under specific constraints. All members correctly identified the constraint satisfaction problem requiring: (1) at least one box ≥2 coins, and (2) one box containing exactly 6 more coins than another. Cross-analysis reveals critical divergence in interpretation and methodology: Member 1 focused on expected value maximization, concluding Bob should guess 18 coins but acknowledging minimum winnings could be $0. Member 2 employed rigorous minimax game theory analysis, systematically testing 4,096 strategies to find optimal guaranteed strategy of guessing [5,6,12] coins, ensuring minimum winnings of 18 coins ($18,000) regardless of host's distribution choice. Member 3 used algebraic modeling to find valid distributions but made critical error by including distributions with 0-coin boxes, which violate the constraint that 'at least one box must contain at least 2 coins' - this constraint applies to the distribution itself, not just that one box somewhere has ≥2 coins. Methodological evaluation: Member 2's minimax approach correctly addresses the question's focus on 'minimum amount' using 'optimal strategy' - this requires worst-case optimization, not expected value maximization. Member 2's systematic testing of all possible strategies and mathematical verification provides highest analytical rigor. Constraint interpretation verification: The phrase 'one box must contain at least 2 coins' means in any valid distribution, the minimum value across all three boxes must be ≥2, eliminating Member 3's 0-coin distributions. Final validation: Member 2's solution guarantees Bob wins exactly his guess amounts when guesses ≤ actual coins, with strategy [5,6,12] ensuring total winnings of 18 coins minimum across all valid host distributions. Confidence level: high.",
