Identify all relevant parameters, values, and measurements associated with this specific reaction that would be needed to apply the Michaelis-Menten equation for velocity calculations.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the Excel file structure and extract the specific data for Reaction 7 before we can apply any equations, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete parameter data for Reaction 7 including substrate concentrations, enzyme concentrations, or other kinetic parameters, (4) This provides the foundation needed to subsequently locate the NIH translation of the 1913 Michaelis-Menten paper and apply the final equation with the extracted data',

The code properly noted that enzyme concentration [E] would need to be specified separately for complete velocity calculations. The tester confirmed successful execution with no errors and complete fulfillment of all PLAN requirements.",
