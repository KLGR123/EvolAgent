  "reason": "Task decomposition: Calculate reaction velocity using the final equation from the NIH translation of the 1913 Michaelis-Menten paper applied to Reaction 7 data from the provided Excel file, requiring precision to four decimal places. Individual member evaluation: All three members demonstrated methodical and accurate approaches. Member 1 systematically extracted Reaction 7 parameters ([S] = 72.3, kcat = 0.0429, Km = 0.052) from the Excel file, located the NIH translation in PMC article PMC3381512, identified the final equation as v = (kcat * [S]) / (Km + [S]), and calculated velocity = 0.0429. Member 2 followed identical methodology, extracting the same parameters, locating the same NIH source, identifying the equation in its original form ν = C·Φ·[S] / ([S] + k) with proper variable definitions, and reaching the same result of 0.0429. Member 3 conducted comprehensive biochemical data analysis, extracted identical Reaction 7 parameters, located multiple NIH translation sources, identified the 1913 equation as v = C·S/(S+KS), and performed multiple verification approaches all yielding 0.0429. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: All members extracted identical parameters from the Excel file, located the same NIH translation sources, and applied mathematically equivalent forms of the Michaelis-Menten equation. No contradictions exist between approaches. Synthesis evaluation: The calculation v = (0.0429 × 72.3) / (0.052 + 72.3) = 3.10167 / 72.352 = 0.04286... rounds to 0.0429 to four decimal places. Final validation: Multiple independent verifications confirm the accuracy of both parameter extraction and mathematical calculation. Confidence level: Very high, supported by unanimous member agreement and multiple verification methods.",
