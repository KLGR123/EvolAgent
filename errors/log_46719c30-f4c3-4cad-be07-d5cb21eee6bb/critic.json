  "reason": "Task decomposition: The task requires identifying the 2015 paper 'Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?', extracting all authors in 'First M. Last' format, determining which author had prior publications before 2015, and finding the title of that author's first paper. Individual solution evaluation: Member 1 conducted systematic research identifying the paper's authors as Pietro Murano and Iram N. Khan, determined Pietro Murano had 21 prior publications (2001-2014), and found his first paper as 'A new software agent'learning'algorithm' from 2001. Member 2 used similar methodology, identified the same authors, found Pietro Murano had prior publications dating to 2007, and determined his first paper as 'Anthropomorphic Vs Non-Anthropomorphic Software Interface Feedback for Online Factual Delivery' from 2003. Member 3 followed comparable approach, identified identical authors, found Pietro Murano's earliest work from 2002 as an EFL experiment, but could not extract the complete exact title. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on core findings: all members correctly identified the 2015 paper and its two authors, unanimously determined Pietro Murano as the author with prior publications, and agreed Iram N. Khan had no significant pre-2015 publications. Critical divergence exists in Pietro Murano's first paper identification: Member 1 claims 2001 publication, Member 2 identifies 2003 paper with complete title and full bibliographic verification, Member 3 suggests 2002 work but lacks complete title. Resolution analysis: Member 2's approach demonstrates superior methodological rigor with comprehensive cross-referencing across multiple authoritative sources (Pietro Murano's personal website, DBLP, IEEE Xplore, ResearchGate), provides complete bibliographic details including DOI verification, and offers the most academically verifiable result. Member 1's 2001 claim lacks sufficient verification detail, while Member 3's 2002 finding remains incomplete. Final validation: Member 2's identification of 'Anthropomorphic Vs Non-Anthropomorphic Software Interface Feedback for Online Factual Delivery' (2003) represents the most thoroughly documented and verifiable first publication with complete academic citation standards met.",
