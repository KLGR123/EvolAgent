# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Research the publication histories of Pietro Murano and Iram N. Khan to determine which author had prior papers before 2015, and identify the title of the first paper authored by that person. Search academic databases, Google Scholar, and author profiles to find their earliest publications and chronologically order their work to determine who had previous research experience and what their inaugural paper was titled.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The previous research successfully identified the two authors of the 2015 'Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?' paper as Pietro Murano and Iram N. Khan, (2) We now need to investigate each author's publication history to determine which one had authored papers prior to 2015, (3) Expected outcome is to identify which author had previous publications and extract the title of their first/earliest paper, (4) This will complete the TASK by finding the specific author with prior work and determining their inaugural publication title

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Determine Year David Sklar First Published Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine

**Description**: Search for information about David Sklar and Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine journal. Focus on finding the specific year when David Sklar first introduced or published Innovation Reports in this medical education publication. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Academic database searches for 'David Sklar Innovation Reports Academic Medicine', (2) PubMed searches combining these terms, (3) Google Scholar searches for relevant publications, (4) Direct searches of Academic Medicine journal archives. Extract publication dates, article titles, and verify the connection between David Sklar and the Innovation Reports concept.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historian mapping the origin of “Innovation Reports” by David Sklar in Academic Medicine to contextualize a literature review on medical education advancements

### Development Step 4: Locate 1851 Atheistic Naturalism Phrenology Mesmerism Book and 2009 Reissuing Publisher

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify a co-authored book from 1851 that advocated for atheistic naturalism, systematically explored phrenology and mesmerism, was controversial for these topics, and was reissued by a publisher in 2009. Search using keywords including '1851 book atheistic naturalism phrenology mesmerism co-authored', '1851 controversial book phrenology mesmerism reissued 2009', 'atheistic naturalism 1851 publication', and 'phrenology mesmerism 1851 authors'. Focus on identifying both the original 1851 publication details and the specific publisher who reissued it in 2009.

**Use Cases**:
- University research library digitization team using the multi-engine search script to locate and verify obscure 1851 scientific texts for digital archive inclusion and confirm 2009 reissue details.
- Historical society librarian employing automated Google Scholar, Bing, JSTOR, and archive.org queries to compile a complete bibliography of co-authored controversial phrenology and mesmerism treatises for a museum exhibition.
- Digital humanities scholar mapping the spread of atheistic naturalism by systematically harvesting primary sources and modern reprint information from multiple search engines for network analysis.
- Rare bookseller validating a potential 1851 first edition’s provenance by cross-referencing academic databases and general web searches to confirm authorship, publication history, and a 2009 specialty press reissue.
- PhD candidate in history of science leveraging the Python multi-method search to uncover mid-19th century philosophical works on phrenology and mesmerism across library catalogs and online archives for dissertation research.
- Independent publisher’s research team discovering forgotten public domain texts for annotated reissues by scanning academic sites and search engines to identify obscure co-authored volumes and track modern rights holders.
- Data journalist investigating the revival of fringe-science publications by extracting publication metadata and reissue patterns from search logs to illustrate how 19th-century controversial works reappear in contemporary niche markets.

### Development Step 7: Identify First Name in Holabird & Roche Firm Title and Variations as of June 2023

**Description**: Research the architectural firm Holabird & Roche to determine the first name appearing in the firm's name as of June 2023. Focus on finding: (1) The complete firm name and any variations or successors, (2) The chronological order of names in the firm title, (3) Verify the firm's status and naming convention as of June 2023, (4) Confirm which name appears first alphabetically or positionally in the official firm designation. Look for the firm's current website, professional directories, architectural databases, and recent project listings to establish the exact naming format used in 2023.

**Use Cases**:
- Architectural heritage management: automating the extraction of founding architect first names (e.g., “William” from Holabird & Root) when cataloging historic Chicago buildings in a digital preservation database
- Legal due diligence for mergers and acquisitions: parsing historical firm titles to confirm partner identities and ensure accurate naming conventions in transaction documents
- Museum exhibit curation: generating founder biographies by programmatically extracting first names from archival architectural firm names for exhibit labels and multimedia displays
- Marketing automation for industry conferences: populating speaker and sponsor profiles with correct founder first names by analyzing firm names in registration data
- Academic publishing workflow: integrating a script to pull principal architect first names from firm titles for citation footnotes in urban design and architectural history journals
- Real estate property management: tagging building portfolios with founding architect first names to enrich maintenance records and promotional brochures for heritage properties
- CRM data enrichment in the AEC sector: automatically appending founders’ first names to architectural firm records in customer databases to enable personalized outreach and relationship tracking
