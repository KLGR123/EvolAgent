This initial phase conducts 4 different searches: (1) Direct title and year search with exact quotes, (2) Academic database search using related keywords, (3) Scholar-specific search targeting academic databases, and (4) HCI research search focusing on menu interface studies. Each search analyzes results for relevance by checking for key terms like 'pie menus', 'linear menus', and '2015'. The code includes detailed result analysis with relevance scoring and saves all search results to workspace for further analysis. This comprehensive approach should help identify the exact paper and extract the author information needed.",

    "description": "Analyzing the comprehensive search results to extract and verify the complete author list for the 2015 paper 'Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?'. The code first inspects the JSON file structure to understand the search data, then systematically processes each search category to identify exact title matches and extract author information. It uses multiple approaches: (1) Direct text analysis for author names, (2) Regex patterns to capture various author name formats, (3) Cross-reference verification across multiple reliable sources, and (4) Publication detail extraction. The analysis found numerous exact matches across ResearchGate, the author's personal website, academic repositories, and Google Scholar, consistently identifying Pietro Murano as the first author and Iram N. Khan as the second author (appearing in various formats like 'I. N. Khan', 'IN Khan' in citations). The code formats the final author names in the required 'First M. Last' format and provides comprehensive verification evidence from multiple independent sources.",
