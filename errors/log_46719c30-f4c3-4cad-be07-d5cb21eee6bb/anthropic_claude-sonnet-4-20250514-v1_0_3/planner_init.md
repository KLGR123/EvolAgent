    "description": "The PLAN has been successfully completed! Through systematic searching across multiple sources, I found the definitive page count for 'Descender Volume 1: Tin Stars' by Jeff Lemire and Dustin Nguyen. The search process involved:\n\n1. **Initial searches**: Started with general book retailers and databases\n2. **Comic-specific databases**: Expanded to specialized comic book sources like ComicVine, League of Comic Geeks, MyComicShop, InStockTrades, and Midtown Comics\n3. **ISBN-based API searches**: Used the ISBN (9781632154262) found from Midtown Comics to query authoritative bibliographic databases\n4. **Final verification**: Successfully extracted the page count from saved Google Books API response\n\n**FINAL RESULT**: Descender Volume 1: Tin Stars has **160 pages**\n\n**Source**: Google Books API - a highly reliable, official bibliographic database that provides accurate publication metadata directly from publishers.\n\n**Confidence Level**: High - This information comes from Google's official book database, which aggregates data directly from publishers and distributors.\n\n**Files Created**:\n- `workspace/descender_final_answer.json` - Contains the definitive answer with full metadata\n- `workspace/google_books__response.json` - Raw API response from Google Books\n- `workspace/open_library__response.json` - Raw API response from Open Library\n- Multiple search result files documenting the comprehensive search process\n\nThe search methodology proved that while retail comic book sites often don't display page counts, official bibliographic APIs like Google Books maintain accurate publication specifications. The 160-page count is consistent with typical comic trade paperback volumes that collect 6 single issues plus additional content.",
