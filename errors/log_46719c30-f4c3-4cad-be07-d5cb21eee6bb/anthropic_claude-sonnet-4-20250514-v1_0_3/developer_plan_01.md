# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for the 2015 paper titled 'Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?' to identify all authors and their complete names in 'First M. Last' format. Extract the full author list, publication details, and verify this is the correct 2015 paper by checking the title match, publication year, and content relevance to menu interface research.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific 2015 paper and extract all author names before we can research their publication histories, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the complete author list with proper name formatting and confirm we have the correct paper, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to then research each author's prior publications and identify who had previous papers and what their first paper was

## Episodic Examples

### Development Step 7: Identify First Name in Holabird & Roche Firm Title and Variations as of June 2023

**Description**: Research the architectural firm Holabird & Roche to determine the first name appearing in the firm's name as of June 2023. Focus on finding: (1) The complete firm name and any variations or successors, (2) The chronological order of names in the firm title, (3) Verify the firm's status and naming convention as of June 2023, (4) Confirm which name appears first alphabetically or positionally in the official firm designation. Look for the firm's current website, professional directories, architectural databases, and recent project listings to establish the exact naming format used in 2023.

**Use Cases**:
- Architectural heritage management: automating the extraction of founding architect first names (e.g., “William” from Holabird & Root) when cataloging historic Chicago buildings in a digital preservation database
- Legal due diligence for mergers and acquisitions: parsing historical firm titles to confirm partner identities and ensure accurate naming conventions in transaction documents
- Museum exhibit curation: generating founder biographies by programmatically extracting first names from archival architectural firm names for exhibit labels and multimedia displays
- Marketing automation for industry conferences: populating speaker and sponsor profiles with correct founder first names by analyzing firm names in registration data
- Academic publishing workflow: integrating a script to pull principal architect first names from firm titles for citation footnotes in urban design and architectural history journals
- Real estate property management: tagging building portfolios with founding architect first names to enrich maintenance records and promotional brochures for heritage properties
- CRM data enrichment in the AEC sector: automatically appending founders’ first names to architectural firm records in customer databases to enable personalized outreach and relationship tracking

- Competitive intelligence for product teams: parse search engine results and press release archives to pinpoint the exact year a rival company introduced a flagship feature, enabling data-driven roadmap planning.
- Academic editorial research: mine online journal archives and search metadata to determine when a specific section (e.g., “Case Studies”) was first established and credit the founding editor with publication details.
- Legal compliance tracking: analyze government websites and legal databases to extract the enactment year of a new regulation by detecting keywords like “enacted” or “established” in legal snippets.
- Patent analytics for R&D: aggregate patent office search results and automatically extract filing and grant years for key inventions in a target technology domain, ranking them by relevance.
- Marketing campaign monitoring: search news aggregators and corporate blogs to identify the introduction date of a major brand slogan or sustainability initiative, capturing launch year and source URLs.
- Public policy timeline building: scrape WHO, CDC, and other public health agency archives to confirm the publication year of critical guidelines, filtering for “published” or “launched” mentions in the text.
- Technical standards research: gather search results from ISO, IEEE, and industry consortium websites to establish when a new communication protocol or best practice standard was first released.
- Corporate heritage documentation: compile internal communications, annual reports, and press coverage to verify the inception year of a company’s flagship community outreach program, extracting evidence and timestamps.

### Development Step 18: Find 2009 Reissue Publisher of Martineau & Atkinson’s Letters on Man’s Nature and Development

**Description**: Verify the specific publisher that reissued 'Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development' by Harriet Martineau and Henry George Atkinson in 2009. The previous search confirmed this is the correct 1851 co-authored book on atheistic naturalism, phrenology, and mesmerism, but we need to identify the exact 2009 reissue publisher. Search for '2009 reissue Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development publisher', 'Martineau Atkinson 2009 republication', and check academic publishers, university presses, or specialty reprint publishers that may have reissued this historical work in 2009.

**Use Cases**:
- University library catalog metadata reconciliation: automatically parsing JSON and HTML records in the library’s digital repository to confirm and correct the 2009 reissue publisher of nineteenth-century works (e.g., Martineau & Atkinson) for accurate OPAC entries
- Academic research group bibliographic verification: deploying regex-driven scans across downloaded archive files and search-result HTML to validate specialized reprint publishers of historical treatises before inclusion in scholarly databases
- Rare books dealer inventory validation: running workspace directory inspections and content-analysis scripts to detect 2009 reissues from specialty presses (such as Nabu Press or Kessinger Publishing) and tag inventory records with precise publisher information
- Digital humanities project metadata extraction: integrating BeautifulSoup-based HTML parsing and JSON analysis workflows to harvest publisher details from a corpus of 2009 reprinted nineteenth-century texts for an online exhibit’s catalog
- Publishing house competitive monitoring: automating web-crawled HTML and local JSON file evaluation to track market entries of specialty reprint editions of classic philosophical works and log their publishers for strategy reports
- Course syllabus compilation for literature programs: scanning PDF syllabi and JSON course package files with regex patterns to ensure the correct 2009 edition and publisher name appear in required reading lists
- National library legal deposit compliance auditing: using scripted directory scans and publisher-pattern extraction to verify that electronically deposited reissued editions include accurate 2009 publisher metadata for archival requirements
- Reference management system enrichment: applying automated analysis of downloaded citation JSON and associated HTML sources to populate and correct the publisher field for a 2009 reissue in researchers’ EndNote or Zotero libraries
