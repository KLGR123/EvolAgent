# Developer Plan 03

## Plan
Search for Pietro Murano's earliest publication to determine the exact title of his first paper. Based on the previous research, Pietro Murano had prior papers before 2015 with his earliest work dating to 2002 involving an EFL experiment on anthropomorphic user interface buttons. Conduct a focused search to find the complete and accurate title of this 2002 paper, as the previous analysis indicated it was his first publication but may not have captured the full title precisely.

## Description
This is the necessary final step because: (1) The previous research successfully identified Pietro Murano as the author who had prior papers before 2015, (2) The search found his earliest work was from 2002 related to an EFL experiment on anthropomorphic user interface buttons, but the exact complete title needs verification, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the precise title of Pietro Murano's first paper to provide the definitive answer to the TASK, (4) This will complete the task by providing the specific title of the first paper authored by the author who had prior publications before the 2015 'Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?' paper

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 4: Locate 1851 Atheistic Naturalism Phrenology Mesmerism Book and 2009 Reissuing Publisher

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify a co-authored book from 1851 that advocated for atheistic naturalism, systematically explored phrenology and mesmerism, was controversial for these topics, and was reissued by a publisher in 2009. Search using keywords including '1851 book atheistic naturalism phrenology mesmerism co-authored', '1851 controversial book phrenology mesmerism reissued 2009', 'atheistic naturalism 1851 publication', and 'phrenology mesmerism 1851 authors'. Focus on identifying both the original 1851 publication details and the specific publisher who reissued it in 2009.

**Use Cases**:
- University research library digitization team using the multi-engine search script to locate and verify obscure 1851 scientific texts for digital archive inclusion and confirm 2009 reissue details.
- Historical society librarian employing automated Google Scholar, Bing, JSTOR, and archive.org queries to compile a complete bibliography of co-authored controversial phrenology and mesmerism treatises for a museum exhibition.
- Digital humanities scholar mapping the spread of atheistic naturalism by systematically harvesting primary sources and modern reprint information from multiple search engines for network analysis.
- Rare bookseller validating a potential 1851 first edition’s provenance by cross-referencing academic databases and general web searches to confirm authorship, publication history, and a 2009 specialty press reissue.
- PhD candidate in history of science leveraging the Python multi-method search to uncover mid-19th century philosophical works on phrenology and mesmerism across library catalogs and online archives for dissertation research.
- Independent publisher’s research team discovering forgotten public domain texts for annotated reissues by scanning academic sites and search engines to identify obscure co-authored volumes and track modern rights holders.
- Data journalist investigating the revival of fringe-science publications by extracting publication metadata and reissue patterns from search logs to illustrate how 19th-century controversial works reappear in contemporary niche markets.

**Description**: Research the architectural firm Holabird & Roche to determine the first name appearing in the firm's name as of June 2023. Focus on finding: (1) The complete firm name and any variations or successors, (2) The chronological order of names in the firm title, (3) Verify the firm's status and naming convention as of June 2023, (4) Confirm which name appears first alphabetically or positionally in the official firm designation. Look for the firm's current website, professional directories, architectural databases, and recent project listings to establish the exact naming format used in 2023.

**Use Cases**:
- Architectural heritage management: automating the extraction of founding architect first names (e.g., “William” from Holabird & Root) when cataloging historic Chicago buildings in a digital preservation database
- Legal due diligence for mergers and acquisitions: parsing historical firm titles to confirm partner identities and ensure accurate naming conventions in transaction documents
- Museum exhibit curation: generating founder biographies by programmatically extracting first names from archival architectural firm names for exhibit labels and multimedia displays
- Marketing automation for industry conferences: populating speaker and sponsor profiles with correct founder first names by analyzing firm names in registration data
- Academic publishing workflow: integrating a script to pull principal architect first names from firm titles for citation footnotes in urban design and architectural history journals
- Real estate property management: tagging building portfolios with founding architect first names to enrich maintenance records and promotional brochures for heritage properties
- CRM data enrichment in the AEC sector: automatically appending founders’ first names to architectural firm records in customer databases to enable personalized outreach and relationship tracking

### Development Step 10: Identify 1851 Atheistic Naturalism Book on Phrenology and Mesmerism Reissued in 2009

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify a co-authored book from 1851 that advocated for atheistic naturalism, systematically explored phrenology and mesmerism, was controversial for these topics, and was reissued by a publisher in 2009. Search using keywords including '1851 book atheistic naturalism phrenology mesmerism co-authored', '1851 controversial book phrenology mesmerism reissued 2009', 'atheistic naturalism 1851 publication', and 'phrenology mesmerism 1851 authors'. Focus on identifying both the original 1851 publication details and the specific publisher who reissued it in 2009.

**Use Cases**:
- Library metadata enhancement and rare book cataloging for academic and public libraries seeking accurate records of 19th-century controversial works
- Digital humanities research corpus creation of Victorian pseudoscientific literature to analyze shifts in scientific discourse over time
- Academic publisher evaluation and annotation of 1851 public domain texts for preparation of critical, annotated reprint editions
- Museum exhibit development on controversial scientific movements, leveraging original correspondence to illustrate phrenology and mesmerism debates
- History of science seminar curriculum design, incorporating primary source epistolary material on atheistic naturalism for graduate coursework
- Bibliographic database enrichment and cross-referencing to improve discoverability of reissued 19th-century works in library catalogs
- NLP training dataset assembly of 19th-century epistolary texts to support stylometric analysis and historical language modeling
- Grant proposal support documentation tracing the evolution of materialist philosophy and pseudoscience for funding in science communication studies

### Development Step 5: Identify 1851 Atheistic Naturalism Book on Phrenology/Mesmerism and Its 2009 Reissue Publisher

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify a co-authored book from 1851 that advocated for atheistic naturalism, systematically explored phrenology and mesmerism, was controversial for these topics, and was reissued by a publisher in 2009. Search using keywords including '1851 book atheistic naturalism phrenology mesmerism co-authored', '1851 controversial book phrenology mesmerism reissued 2009', 'atheistic naturalism 1851 publication', and 'phrenology mesmerism 1851 authors'. Focus on identifying both the original 1851 publication details and the specific publisher who reissued it in 2009.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historian automating the identification of obscure 19th-century texts and their modern reissue details for a journal article on atheistic naturalism controversies
- Library metadata specialist using targeted web and scholarly search scripts to update collection records with publication dates, co-authors, and reprint publisher information
- Digital humanities project integrating automated web scraping and match-scoring to curate a dataset of phrenology and mesmerism publications for network and discourse analysis
- Publishing house acquisitions team conducting due diligence on public domain works by detecting original 1851 publication details and 2009 reissue rights before green-lighting a new edition
- Intellectual property attorney verifying authorship, publication history, and modern publisher claims for 19th-century texts in a litigation involving contested reprint rights
- Graduate student building a reproducible search pipeline to gather evidence on historical debates in naturalism, phrenology, and mesmerism for a dissertation timeline and annotated bibliography
- Cultural heritage institution employing automated Google Scholar analysis to tag and contextualize controversial topics in its digital archive of 19th-century manuscripts
- Open-access repository manager using a customized search-and-analyze workflow to prioritize the digitization of historically significant works with detailed bibliographic provenance
