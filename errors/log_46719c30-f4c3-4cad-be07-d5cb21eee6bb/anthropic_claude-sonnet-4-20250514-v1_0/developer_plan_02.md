# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Research the publication history of Pietro Murano and Iram N. Khan to identify which author had prior papers before 2015, then determine the title of their first published paper. Based on the developer's findings, both authors had previous publications: Pietro Murano (2007 and 2012 papers) and Iram N. Khan (2014 paper). Since Pietro Murano has the earliest publication from 2007, find the exact title of his first paper 'CraftML: 3D Modeling is Web Programming' and verify this is indeed his earliest academic work.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The developer successfully identified both authors had prior publications, with Pietro Murano having the earliest from 2007, (2) We need to confirm Pietro Murano is the author with prior papers and verify the exact title of his first paper, (3) Expected outcome is to definitively identify Pietro Murano's 2007 paper title as the answer, (4) This will complete the TASK by providing the title of the first paper authored by the author who had prior publications before the 2015 pie menus paper

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Determine Year David Sklar First Published Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine

**Description**: Search for information about David Sklar and Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine journal. Focus on finding the specific year when David Sklar first introduced or published Innovation Reports in this medical education publication. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Academic database searches for 'David Sklar Innovation Reports Academic Medicine', (2) PubMed searches combining these terms, (3) Google Scholar searches for relevant publications, (4) Direct searches of Academic Medicine journal archives. Extract publication dates, article titles, and verify the connection between David Sklar and the Innovation Reports concept.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historian mapping the origin of “Innovation Reports” by David Sklar in Academic Medicine to contextualize a literature review on medical education advancements
- Medical librarian automating the extraction of publication dates and author metadata for David Sklar’s Innovation Reports to build a searchable institutional repository
- Curriculum developer analyzing the inception year of Innovation Reports for integrating historical innovation milestones into a medical education program syllabus
- Grant proposal writer validating the first appearance of Innovation Reports by David Sklar as evidence for funding a retrospective study on innovation diffusion in healthcare
- Bibliometric analyst systematically harvesting and verifying David Sklar’s publication timeline in Academic Medicine to conduct trend analysis on educational innovation research
- Science journalist investigating the debut of Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine to write a feature story on pioneers of medical education innovation
- Healthcare quality assessor auditing the historical publication record of Innovation Reports to ensure compliance with accreditation standards for innovation coursework

### Development Step 2: Identify Year David Sklar Introduced Innovation Reports Section in Academic Medicine Journal

**Description**: Search for information about David Sklar and Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine journal. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Direct search for 'David Sklar Innovation Reports Academic Medicine journal', (2) Search Academic Medicine journal archives or database for articles by David Sklar, (3) Search for 'Innovation Reports Academic Medicine introduction year', (4) Look for historical information about when Innovation Reports section was established in Academic Medicine. Focus on identifying the specific year when David Sklar introduced or established the Innovation Reports feature in this medical journal.

**Use Cases**:
- Competitive intelligence for product teams: parse search engine results and press release archives to pinpoint the exact year a rival company introduced a flagship feature, enabling data-driven roadmap planning.
- Academic editorial research: mine online journal archives and search metadata to determine when a specific section (e.g., “Case Studies”) was first established and credit the founding editor with publication details.
- Legal compliance tracking: analyze government websites and legal databases to extract the enactment year of a new regulation by detecting keywords like “enacted” or “established” in legal snippets.
- Patent analytics for R&D: aggregate patent office search results and automatically extract filing and grant years for key inventions in a target technology domain, ranking them by relevance.
- Marketing campaign monitoring: search news aggregators and corporate blogs to identify the introduction date of a major brand slogan or sustainability initiative, capturing launch year and source URLs.
- Public policy timeline building: scrape WHO, CDC, and other public health agency archives to confirm the publication year of critical guidelines, filtering for “published” or “launched” mentions in the text.
- Technical standards research: gather search results from ISO, IEEE, and industry consortium websites to establish when a new communication protocol or best practice standard was first released.
- Corporate heritage documentation: compile internal communications, annual reports, and press coverage to verify the inception year of a company’s flagship community outreach program, extracting evidence and timestamps.

### Development Step 7: Identify First Name in Holabird & Roche Firm Title and Variations as of June 2023

**Description**: Research the architectural firm Holabird & Roche to determine the first name appearing in the firm's name as of June 2023. Focus on finding: (1) The complete firm name and any variations or successors, (2) The chronological order of names in the firm title, (3) Verify the firm's status and naming convention as of June 2023, (4) Confirm which name appears first alphabetically or positionally in the official firm designation. Look for the firm's current website, professional directories, architectural databases, and recent project listings to establish the exact naming format used in 2023.

**Use Cases**:
- Architectural heritage management: automating the extraction of founding architect first names (e.g., “William” from Holabird & Root) when cataloging historic Chicago buildings in a digital preservation database
- Legal due diligence for mergers and acquisitions: parsing historical firm titles to confirm partner identities and ensure accurate naming conventions in transaction documents
- Museum exhibit curation: generating founder biographies by programmatically extracting first names from archival architectural firm names for exhibit labels and multimedia displays
- Marketing automation for industry conferences: populating speaker and sponsor profiles with correct founder first names by analyzing firm names in registration data
- Academic publishing workflow: integrating a script to pull principal architect first names from firm titles for citation footnotes in urban design and architectural history journals
- Real estate property management: tagging building portfolios with founding architect first names to enrich maintenance records and promotional brochures for heritage properties
- CRM data enrichment in the AEC sector: automatically appending founders’ first names to architectural firm records in customer databases to enable personalized outreach and relationship tracking
