  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine what feature causes the largest bubble size in the DeepFruits fruit detection graph on Connected Papers from 2016. All three members successfully located the DeepFruits paper ('Deepfruits: A fruit detection system using deep neural networks' by Sa et al., 2016) on Connected Papers and conducted comprehensive research into bubble sizing methodology. Member 1 evaluation: Conducted extensive research across multiple iterations, generating 25+ research files and achieving 95%+ confidence level. Correctly identified citation count as the primary metric with strong evidence basis from industry standards. Member 2 evaluation: Successfully located the specific Connected Papers URL and obtained multiple authoritative sources with direct quotes confirming 'The size of each bubble represents the number of citations' and 'bigger nodes are highly cited papers.' Provided clear, well-documented evidence. Member 3 evaluation: Performed detailed technical analysis of the actual graph visualization, identifying 82 SVG circles and the largest bubble with radius 19.088087506872046. However, made less precise conclusion about 'citation count or influence score' rather than definitively identifying citation count. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: All members reached the same core conclusion that citation count determines bubble size. Members 1 and 2 provided more definitive evidence specifically identifying citation count, while Member 3's technical analysis confirmed the sizing mechanism but was less precise about the specific metric. Synthesis evaluation: The overwhelming evidence from multiple authoritative sources, industry standards, and direct platform documentation confirms that Connected Papers uses citation count as the primary feature determining bubble size. Final validation: Citation count is the standard metric used across academic visualization platforms, with larger bubbles representing papers with higher citation counts.",
