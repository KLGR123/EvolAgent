### Identify the Unique Food's CATEGORY Text Element from XML Based on Spreadsheet Duplicate Analysis

**TASK**: Which of the text elements under CATEGORIES in the XML would contain the one food in the spreadsheet that does not appear a second time under a different name? Attached local file(s): ['data/gaia/2023/validation/9b54f9d9-35ee-4a14-b62f-d130ea00317f/food_duplicates.xls', 'data/gaia/2023/validation/9b54f9d9-35ee-4a14-b62f-d130ea00317f/CATEGORIES.xml']
