  "reason": "Task analysis: Calculate the percentage of 1959 USDA food standards that have been superseded by August 2023, requiring location of the July 2, 1959 document, extraction of qualifying items from specific sections, and determination of their current supersession status. Member evaluation reveals significant methodological differences: Member 1 located the document through Google Books but encountered access restrictions preventing content extraction, establishing comprehensive contact methods for manual retrieval but unable to complete the analysis. Member 2 successfully located the identical document through Internet Archive, downloaded the complete PDF, extracted all qualifying standards (3 dehydrated items and 41 frozen items totaling 44 standards), and conducted comprehensive supersession research determining 32 standards (72.7%) were likely superseded. Member 3 conducted exhaustive searches but concluded the document was inaccessible through digital repositories, contradicting the successful document location by Members 1 and 2. Cross-analysis shows Members 1 and 2 both located the same document (Google Books ID 5GLLnQEACAAJ and Internet Archive identifier unitedstatesstan14unit_4 respectively) with identical titles and dates, while Member 3's search methodology missed these accessible sources. Member 2's approach demonstrates superior execution by not only locating the document but successfully extracting content and completing the full analytical chain through supersession research. The 72.7% supersession rate rounds to 73% as required by the task specification. Integration assessment confirms Member 2's methodology is most comprehensive and reliable, providing complete task fulfillment with systematic document processing, intelligent parsing, and evidence-based supersession analysis through current USDA standards databases.",
