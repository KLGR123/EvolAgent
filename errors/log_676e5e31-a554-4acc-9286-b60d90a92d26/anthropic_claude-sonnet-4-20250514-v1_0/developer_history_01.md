    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code executed but produced completely incorrect output that doesn't match the **PLAN** at all. The **CURRENT CODE** was designed to search for a 1959 USDA standards document using SerpAPI, but the **CURRENT CODE OUTPUT** shows it executed a completely different YouTube/BBC Earth video search instead. This appears to be a major code execution error where the wrong script ran. The output shows searches for 'BBC Earth silly animals' and 'Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments' videos, which has zero connection to the **PLAN** objective of finding the July 2, 1959 USDA standards document. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - completely wrong functionality executed. The code logic in **CURRENT CODE** looks correct for the USDA document search task, but somehow a different script ran instead. Immediate fix needed: Verify the correct code is being executed and ensure the USDA document search script runs as intended, not the BBC Earth video search.",

I'm conducting a comprehensive search for the July 2, 1959 United States standards document for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products. Based on the partial results visible in the failed execution, I can see that archive.org has the exact target document. I'm using 10 targeted search queries focusing on: (1) exact date matching 'July 2, 1959', (2) specific government sites (archive.org, govinfo.gov, nal.usda.gov), (3) PDF document access, (4) USDA Agricultural Marketing Service sources, and (5) the specific sections mentioned (dried/dehydrated, frozen/chilled). The search results are categorized by exact matches, archival sources, government sources, and relevance scores to identify the most promising leads for accessing the complete document content.",

The corrected search successfully executed and found multiple exact matches for the July 2, 1959 USDA standards document. Key findings: (1) Archive.org has the exact document 'United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products (as of July 2, 1959)' with direct access, (2) Wikimedia Commons provides PDF download access to the same document, (3) Multiple government sources (.gov domains) were identified with related materials, (4) The search confirmed the document contains the target sections (dried/dehydrated and frozen/chilled content). The search executed 3 out of 10 planned queries before timeout, but successfully located the primary target document with exact date and title matches. **PLAN** alignment: 100% - the specific 1959 USDA document has been definitively located with multiple access points. Recommendation: Save the comprehensive search results to 'workspace/usda_1959_document_locations.json' for reference, then proceed to access and download the identified document from Archive.org or Wikimedia Commons to extract the dried/dehydrated and frozen/chilled sections as required.",

The previous search definitively located the exact document 'United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products (as of July 2, 1959)' with multiple access points. I'm trying three different URLs: (1) the main Archive.org PDF download link, (2) an alternative Archive.org PDF link found in search results, and (3) the Wikimedia Commons PDF link. The code includes proper error handling, file verification, and creates a comprehensive download summary. Once downloaded, this PDF will contain the target 'dried and dehydrated section' and 'frozen/chilled section' that need to be extracted and analyzed according to the PLAN. The download uses appropriate headers and streaming to handle large PDF files efficiently.",

The document is now available locally for content extraction of the 'dried and dehydrated section' and 'frozen/chilled section' as specified in the **PLAN**.

    "description": "Comprehensive analysis of the downloaded July 2, 1959 USDA standards document. This code: (1) Inspects the workspace to locate the downloaded PDF and summary JSON files, (2) Safely examines the JSON structure before parsing to understand the download metadata, (3) Uses LangChain PyPDFLoader to parse the PDF document and extract all pages, (4) Searches through all pages to identify content related to 'dried and dehydrated' and 'frozen/chilled' sections, (5) Extracts and displays relevant content from pages containing the target sections, (6) Saves comprehensive extraction results including page numbers, content, and metadata to a JSON file for further reference. The approach follows best practices by first inspecting file structures before accessing them, and provides detailed progress reporting throughout the extraction process. This completes the PLAN objective by successfully locating and extracting the specific sections from the 1959 USDA standards document.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed the **PLAN** requirements. The script successfully located, downloaded, and parsed the July 2, 1959 USDA standards document, extracting both target sections as specified. Key achievements: (1) Found and accessed the 834KB PDF document from Archive.org, (2) Successfully parsed all 6 pages using LangChain PyPDFLoader, (3) Located 'dried/dehydrated' content on pages 2, 3, and 4, (4) Located 'frozen/chilled' content on pages 4 and 5, (5) Extracted and displayed the actual content from both target sections, (6) Saved comprehensive extraction results to workspace JSON file. The output shows the document contains exactly what was requested - the dried/dehydrated section lists items like apples, apricots, dates, figs, prunes, raisins, and dehydrated juices, while the frozen/chilled section includes apples, asparagus, beans, berries, corn, concentrated juices, and other frozen produce with their effective dates. **PLAN** alignment: 100% - the July 2, 1959 United States standards document has been successfully found and both the 'dried and dehydrated section' and 'frozen/chilled section' have been extracted and documented. No further development needed - the task is complete.",
