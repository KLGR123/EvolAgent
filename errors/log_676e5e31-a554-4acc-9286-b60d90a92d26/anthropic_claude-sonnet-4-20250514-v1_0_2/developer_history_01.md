This code executes 10 targeted search queries using SerpAPI to locate the official USDA/government publication containing the 'dried and dehydrated section' and 'Frozen/Chilled section'. \n\nThe approach includes: (1) Multiple search query variations targeting specific date, authority (USDA), and content sections, (2) Real-time analysis of search results with relevance scoring based on key indicators like date match, government source, and section content, (3) Categorization of results by relevance, official sources, document format, and target sections, (4) Comprehensive result storage in JSON format for detailed analysis, and (5) Assessment of search success with recommendations for next steps.\n\nThe code prioritizes government domains (.gov, usda.gov, archives.gov) and PDF documents while looking for specific indicators of the target 1959 standards document. Results are saved to workspace/usda_1959_standards_search_results_[timestamp].json for further analysis and document retrieval.",

This code inspects the previously generated search results JSON file to identify and confirm the target document location.\n\nThe approach includes: (1) File structure inspection to understand the search results format before processing, (2) Systematic analysis of all search results to identify the exact target document mentioned in the tester feedback, (3) Categorization of sources by type (Archive.org, Wikimedia, Government) for reliability assessment, (4) Specific identification of the document title 'United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products (as of July 2, 1959)', (5) Verification of section mentions ('dried and dehydrated section' and 'Frozen/Chilled section'), and (6) Extraction of direct access links for document retrieval.\n\nBased on the tester feedback confirming successful identification of the target document with multiple high-relevance results and direct links to Archive.org and Wikimedia Commons, this analysis confirms the document location and provides clear access paths. The code generates a comprehensive assessment showing mission success with the exact 1959 USDA standards document located and ready for content extraction from the specified sections.",
