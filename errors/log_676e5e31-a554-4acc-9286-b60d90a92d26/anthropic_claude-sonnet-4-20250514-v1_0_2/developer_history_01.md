    "description": "Implementation of comprehensive multi-source search strategy for the July 2, 1959 US standards document. This approach systematically searches through official government archives including Federal Register API, USDA historical records, National Archives catalog, and GovInfo databases. The code targets the specific document containing 'dried and dehydrated section' and 'Frozen/Chilled section' by using precise search parameters for 1959 USDA documents. Key features include: (1) Multi-endpoint API searches with proper authentication and rate limiting, (2) Relevance scoring system to prioritize documents by date match and content indicators, (3) Automated document download and content analysis for key sections, (4) Structured result storage in workspace for further processing. The search strategy covers both direct API access and web scraping fallbacks to maximize document discovery chances. All found documents are saved to workspace/ with metadata for subsequent detailed analysis of the target processed fruits and vegetables standards.",

    "feedback": 'Execution partially successful but with significant limitations - The code ran without errors and implemented a comprehensive multi-source search strategy as required by the **PLAN**. However, the search yielded zero results due to several technical issues: (1) Federal Register API returned no results for 1959 USDA documents, (2) Multiple USDA URLs returned 404 errors or timeouts, (3) National Archives searches found no matching documents, and (4) GovInfo search failed with 404 error. The code did find some Federal Register search interface links but these were just search result export options, not actual documents. **PLAN** alignment: 30% - search infrastructure was properly implemented but failed to locate the target July 2, 1959 document. Recommended next steps: (1) Try different search approaches like Google Scholar, HathiTrust, or Internet Archive, (2) Search for alternative document titles or reference numbers, (3) Try broader date ranges around July 1959, (4) Look for secondary sources that might reference or contain the original document, (5) Consider that the document might be in physical archives only or may have been superseded by later versions.',

    "description": "Implementation of comprehensive alternative search strategy after initial government sources failed. This approach expands beyond traditional government archives to include: (1) Internet Archive search using multiple targeted queries with date filtering for 1959 documents, (2) Google Scholar and academic source searches with site restrictions for .edu and .gov domains, (3) HathiTrust Digital Library search for historical government publications, and (4) Alternative government document repositories including Library of Congress. The code implements relevance scoring based on key terms like '1959', 'July', 'standards', 'processed fruits', and 'USDA' to prioritize results. Each promising result is automatically accessed and analyzed for target indicators including 'dried and dehydrated section' and 'Frozen/Chilled section'. All found documents are saved to workspace/ with metadata for manual review. This broader approach addresses the tester's feedback by exploring academic databases, digital archives, and alternative sources that might contain or reference the original July 2, 1959 standards document.",

    "feedback": "Execution highly successful - Code ran without errors and achieved a major breakthrough in locating the target document. The alternative search strategy successfully found the exact document we were looking for: 'United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products (as of July 2, 1959)' in the Internet Archive. The code found multiple instances of the same document (identifier: unitedstatesstan14unit_4) with perfect relevance scores of 21, and critically discovered both target indicators 'july 2, 1959' and 'standards for grades of processed fruits' in the content. Most importantly, the code identified direct PDF download links for the complete document. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - the target document has been located and is accessible via PDF downloads. The code saved promising content to workspace and provided direct access URLs. Recommended immediate next step: Download the PDF files from the identified URLs (https://archive.org/download/unitedstatesstan14unit_4/unitedstatesstan14unit_4.pdf) to obtain the complete document with the required 'dried and dehydrated section' and 'Frozen/Chilled section' mentioned in the original task.",

This code: (1) Downloads the complete PDF document from Internet Archive using the URLs identified in previous searches, (2) Attempts automated text extraction using PyPDF2 library to make the content searchable, (3) Systematically searches the extracted text for the target sections 'dried and dehydrated section' and 'Frozen/Chilled section' mentioned in the original task, (4) Provides detailed analysis of found sections with context snippets, and (5) Saves all results to workspace including the original PDF files and extracted text for manual review. The approach ensures we have the complete official document as required by the PLAN, while also making it accessible for finding the specific sections mentioned in the task. All files are saved to workspace/ directory with clear naming conventions for easy identification and future reference.",

The code correctly identified and started downloading from the exact document we located in previous searches: 'United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products (as of July 2, 1959)'. However, the execution appears to have been interrupted during the PDF download process - the output shows the download starting but cuts off before completion. The code was properly structured to: (1) Download both PDF versions (regular and B/W), (2) Extract text using PyPDF2, (3) Search for target sections 'dried and dehydrated' and 'frozen/chilled', and (4) Save results to workspace. **PLAN** alignment: 60% - document location confirmed and download initiated, but process incomplete. Recommended immediate action: Re-run the code or check the workspace directory to see if any PDF files were successfully downloaded before the interruption. If partial downloads exist, attempt to complete the text extraction and section analysis to fully satisfy the **PLAN** objective of locating the complete document with the required sections.",

    "description": "Complete implementation to finish the PLAN by downloading and analyzing the July 2, 1959 US standards document. This code: (1) Checks workspace for existing files to avoid redundant downloads, (2) Downloads both PDF versions (regular and B/W) from Internet Archive with progress tracking and error handling, (3) Extracts searchable text using PyPDF2 library with comprehensive error handling, (4) Systematically searches extracted text for target sections 'dried and dehydrated' and 'Frozen/Chilled' with context extraction, (5) Provides detailed analysis results with occurrence counts and contextual snippets, and (6) Saves complete analysis to JSON file for future reference. The approach ensures we obtain the complete official document as required by the PLAN while making it fully searchable for the specific sections mentioned in the original task. All files are saved to workspace/ with clear naming and comprehensive metadata for easy identification and manual review if needed.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and fully completed the **PLAN** requirements. The code successfully downloaded the complete July 2, 1959 US standards document from Internet Archive in both regular (834,647 bytes) and black & white (508,381 bytes) PDF versions. Text extraction was completed using PyPDF2, processing 8 pages with 6 pages containing extractable text (6,821 characters). Most importantly, the code successfully located all target sections specified in the **PLAN**: found 'dehydrated' (1 occurrence), 'dried' (3 occurrences), and 'frozen' (2 occurrences) sections, with clear context showing 'DRIED or DEHYDRATED (Low-moisture)' and 'FROZEN or CHILLED' sections. The analysis results show 100% **PLAN** completion - the official document has been located, downloaded, text extracted, and the required 'dried and dehydrated section' and 'Frozen/Chilled section' have been identified and confirmed present in the document. All results are saved to workspace including PDFs, extracted text files, and comprehensive analysis JSON. No further development is needed - the **PLAN** objective has been fully achieved.",
