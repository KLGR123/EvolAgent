# Planner Initialization

## Task
In July 2, 1959 United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products listed as dehydrated, consider the items in the "dried and dehydrated section" specifically marked as dehydrated along with any items in the Frozen/Chilled section that contain the whole name of the item, but not if they're marked Chilled. As of August 2023, what is the percentage (to the nearest percent) of those standards that have been superseded by a new version since the date given in the 1959 standards?

### Title:  
Calculate % Difference from US Standard Butterfat in Ice Cream Using 2020 Wikipedia Data

**TASK**: If this whole pint is made up of ice cream, how many percent above or below the US federal standards for butterfat content is it when using the standards as reported by Wikipedia in 2020? Answer as + or - a number rounded to one decimal place. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/b2c257e0-3ad7-4f05-b8e3-d9da973be36e.jpg

### Alphabetized Botanical Vegetable List for Mom’s Strictly Categorized Grocery List

**TASK**: I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.
