### When Was Regression Label Added to Oldest Closed numpy.polynomial Issue (MM/DD/YY)

### Unlambda code: which character to add to output “For penguins”?

**TASK**: In Unlambda, what exact charcter or text needs to be added to correct the following code to output "For penguins"? If what is needed is a character, answer with the name of the character.
