### When Was Regression Label Added to Oldest Closed numpy.polynomial Issue (MM/DD/YY)

**TASK**: According to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?

Focus on finding the oldest closed issue with this label and determine when the 'Regression' label was added to that specific issue.

Extract the issue creation date, closure date, and label addition timestamp for the oldest matching issue.",

### Unlambda code: which character to add to output “For penguins”?

**TASK**: In Unlambda, what exact charcter or text needs to be added to correct the following code to output "For penguins"? If what is needed is a character, answer with the name of the character.
