    "plan": 'Identify the King of Pop (Michael Jackson) and determine his sixth studio album, then find the fifth single from that album. Research the song structure to locate the lyrics and identify the last word that appears before the second chorus begins.',
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish which artist is the 'King of Pop' and identify his sixth studio album, (2) No previous research has been conducted based on the empty HISTORY, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific song (fifth single from sixth album) and access its structure to analyze chorus placement, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK by systematically identifying the target song before analyzing its lyrical structure",

    "description": "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! The comprehensive research has successfully completed all objectives of the PLAN. Through systematic web searches and lyrical analysis, we determined that: (1) The King of Pop is Michael Jackson, (2) His sixth studio album is Thriller (1982), (3) The fifth single from Thriller is 'Human Nature', (4) The song structure follows Intro → Verse 1 → Chorus → Verse 2 → Second Chorus, and (5) The complete Verse 2 ends with 'She likes the way I stare' - making 'stare' the last word that appears before the second chorus begins. The solution was verified through multiple authoritative sources including Michael Jackson Wiki, Genius.com, and Reddit discussions containing complete lyrics. All research data and the final solution have been saved to workspace files for verification. The PLAN has been 100% completed with high confidence.",
