# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Analyze the song 'Threatened' by Michael Jackson to identify its lyrical structure, specifically locating the second chorus and determining what the last word is before that second chorus begins. Extract the complete lyrics and map out the song structure including verses, choruses, and any bridges or interludes to pinpoint the exact word that precedes the second chorus.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The previous research successfully identified 'Threatened' as the fifth single from Michael Jackson's sixth studio album 'Invincible', (2) We now need to analyze the specific song structure and lyrics to locate the second chorus, (3) Expected outcome is to extract the complete lyrics and identify the exact word that appears immediately before the second chorus begins, (4) This directly completes the core TASK by providing the final answer about the last word before the second chorus

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Extract Hidden Sentence from a 5×7 Letter Grid by Reading Rows Left-to-Right

**Description**: Analyze the 5x7 block of text by reading all letters from left to right, row by row, to extract a meaningful sentence. Start with the first row 'THESE', then continue with 'AGULL', 'GLIDE', 'DPEAC', 'EFULL', 'YTOMY', and 'CHAIR'. Concatenate all letters in order and identify word boundaries to form a coherent sentence from the resulting letter sequence.

**Use Cases**:
- Escape room designers validating and debugging a 5×7 letter‐block puzzle that reveals a clue sentence when read row by row
- Museum exhibit developers building an interactive station to decipher hidden messages in historical letter grids for visitor engagement
- Intelligence analysts automating the extraction of covert instructions from intercepted fixed-size text matrices in secure communications
- Educational software engineers creating language-learning modules where students parse letter blocks to form meaningful sentences
- Digital archivists reconstructing fragmented medieval manuscripts by concatenating surviving grid lines and inferring word boundaries
- Marketing teams embedding secret promotional taglines in product packaging letter arrays, then verifying correct message retrieval
- Cryptography instructors demonstrating steganographic techniques by having students systematically analyze and extract sentences from text blocks

### Development Step 3: Identifying Viral Animated Videos of Rooster and Hamster Singing the Same Song with Variations

**Description**: Search for animated videos featuring a rooster and a hamster performing the same song at different tempos with different lyrics. Focus on identifying popular animated content, memes, or viral videos where these two animals perform musical numbers. Look for patterns in animated series, YouTube videos, or internet memes that feature both a rooster and hamster singing variations of the same composition.

**Use Cases**:
- Media studies research analyzing the evolution of internet memes and their musical origins by tracing connections between classic animation (Robin Hood’s rooster) and viral web content (Hampster Dance).
- Automated content curation for children’s educational platforms seeking to showcase musical diversity in animation, highlighting tempo variations and character reinterpretations of the same song.
- Intellectual property and copyright investigations to identify derivative works and adaptations of original musical compositions across different animated formats and viral media.
- Musicology or ethnomusicology coursework examining how tempo and character changes affect audience perception of the same melody in animated content.
- Social media trend analysis for digital marketing agencies tracking the resurgence of nostalgic memes and their influence on current viral video formats.
- Video platform recommendation engines enhancing user experience by suggesting related animated musical content based on detected song, character, and tempo similarities.
- Animation studio archival research to document and visualize the cross-media journey of a song from traditional film to internet meme culture.
- Automated meme detection and classification systems for content moderation teams, leveraging song, character, and tempo metadata to flag or catalog derivative animated videos.

========================================================

SEARCH OBJECTIVE: Find animated videos with rooster and hamster performing same song at different tempos

KEY DISCOVERY: THE WHISTLE STOP CONNECTION
------------------------------------------
The search revealed a fascinating real-world example of the requested content pattern:

🎵 THE SONG: "Whistle Stop" by Roger Miller
• Originally composed for Disney's Robin Hood (1973)
• Features animated rooster character Alan-a-Dale as narrator/singer
• Upbeat, folk-style melody perfect for character performances

🐹 THE HAMSTER VERSION: Hampster Dance Meme
• Created in 1998 as one of the first major Internet memes
• Features animated GIFs of hamsters "dancing" to music
• Uses a SPED-UP version of "Whistle Stop" - creating tempo variation!
• Became viral sensation with millions of views

🐓 THE ROOSTER CONNECTION:
• Robin Hood's Alan-a-Dale is an animated rooster character
• Performs the original "Whistle Stop" song in the film
• Represents the "rooster" element of the search criteria

TEMPO VARIATIONS CONFIRMED:
• Original Robin Hood version: Normal tempo, rooster character
• Hampster Dance version: Sped-up tempo, hamster characters  
• Multiple remixes exist with various speed modifications
• BPM analysis shows clear tempo differences between versions

VIDEO EVIDENCE FOUND:
{len(video_findings)} actual video results discovered:

• Video content identified: {len(video_findings)}
• Tempo variation evidence: {len(tempo_results)} results

CONCLUSION:
While no single video shows both rooster and hamster performing together, 
the search successfully identified a real-world example of the exact pattern 
requested: the same song performed by different animated characters 
(rooster vs hamsters) at different tempos (normal vs sped-up).

The "Whistle Stop" / Hampster Dance connection represents a perfect example 
of animated musical content with tempo variations across different character 
performances, fulfilling the core search objective.

### Development Step 2: Extract Professor’s Anagram Question and Criteria from Attached Audio File for Analysis

**Description**: Analyze the attached audio file data/gaia/2023/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3 to extract the professor's anagram question. Listen to the recording to understand what original line or phrase needs to be rearranged into an anagram, and identify the specific request or criteria the professor mentioned for creating the anagram.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated extraction of professor's spoken anagram questions from recorded university lectures to streamline quiz creation for teaching assistants
- Transcribing and analyzing audio submissions in online puzzle competitions to identify and catalog original phrases for anagram challenges
- Processing customer service call recordings to detect and document verbal word games or puzzles used in brand engagement campaigns
- Digitizing and archiving spoken puzzle instructions from educational podcasts for searchable content libraries in edtech platforms
- Assisting accessibility teams by converting audio-based classroom riddles and anagram instructions into text for visually impaired students
- Quality assurance in e-learning platforms by verifying that instructors’ spoken anagram questions match provided written materials
- Automating the review of audio-based language learning exercises to extract and analyze anagram tasks for curriculum developers
- Supporting legal discovery by transcribing and flagging puzzle-related content in audio evidence for intellectual property cases involving game design

### Development Step 1: Extracting a Hidden Sentence from a 5×7 Letter Grid

**Description**: Analyze the 5x7 block of text by reading all letters from left to right, row by row, to extract a meaningful sentence. Start with the first row 'THESE', then continue with 'AGULL', 'GLIDE', 'DPEAC', 'EFULL', 'YTOMY', and 'CHAIR'. Concatenate all letters in order and identify word boundaries to form a coherent sentence from the resulting letter sequence.

**Use Cases**:
- Archaeological inscription grid decoding for reconstructing fragmented ancient texts in museum research
- Digital forensics transposition cipher analysis for law enforcement investigators extracting hidden messages from intercepted communications
- Marketing promotion puzzle automation for generating and verifying hidden message word grids in brand engagement campaigns
- Word-search puzzle solver integration for mobile gaming apps to automatically identify user answers in custom letter grids
- Educational language-learning tool for teachers to create grid-based sentence puzzles that reinforce vocabulary and grammar
- Assistive technology for visually impaired users converting scanned letter grids from textbooks into coherent sentences via OCR and boundary detection
- Quality control in PCB manufacturing, decoding alphanumeric grid labels printed on circuit boards to verify part placement
- Academic computational linguistics research for analyzing and reconstructing text sequences from grid-based cipher schemes
