<p>Episodic Examples:<br>### List Pre-2020 US Zip Codes for Invasive Clownfish Sightings</p>
<p>**TASK**: I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.</p>
<p>```<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Identify the main character fish species from the movie Finding Nemo and then search for USGS databases or reports documenting nonnative fish species occurrences in the United States before 2020. Focus on finding official USGS records that include specific location data with zip codes for where this species was found as an invasive or nonnative population.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to first confirm the fish species from Finding Nemo (likely clownfish/Amphiprioninae) and then locate USGS nonnative species databases, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this topic, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the target species and find USGS documentation of nonnative occurrences with geographic specificity, (4) This directly targets finding the zip code locations where the species was documented as nonnative before 2020 as requested in the TASK&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;PLAN objective has been successfully completed. The implementation achieved all required components: (1) Identified the main character fish species from Finding Nemo as Amphiprion ocellaris (clown anemonefish), (2) Successfully accessed the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Database and located species profile with ID 3243, (3) Found a documented nonnative occurrence record (Specimen ID: 1468741) from 2018 in Florida, which satisfies the &#x27;before 2020&#x27; requirement, (4) Extracted specific location data including Pinellas County and Fred Howard Park locality that provides sufficient information for ZIP code identification (Holiday, FL area: ZIP codes 34690-34691). The final comprehensive analysis was saved to workspace/finding_nemo_clownfish_usgs_complete_analysis.json with complete documentation of the specimen record, location details, and ZIP code conversion potential. The USGS record confirms this was a managed nonnative population (status: eradicated), validating the nonnative species requirement. All PLAN objectives have been verified and documented with official USGS data sources.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Convert the Florida location data from the USGS record (Pinellas County, Fred Howard Park area in Holiday, FL) to the specific five-digit ZIP codes for that geographic area. Cross-reference multiple sources including USPS ZIP code databases, local government records, and mapping services to ensure accuracy of the ZIP codes covering the Fred Howard Park and Holiday, Florida region where the clownfish specimen was documented.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the necessary next step because: (1) The developer successfully identified the clownfish species and found the USGS nonnative occurrence record from 2018 in Florida, (2) The location data shows Pinellas County/Fred Howard Park/Holiday FL area with potential ZIP codes 34690-34691, but we need to verify the exact ZIP codes for the documented location, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the precise five-digit ZIP codes where the nonnative clownfish was found according to USGS records, (4) This completes the TASK by providing the required ZIP code format for the answer.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;The PLAN has been successfully completed. The code has successfully converted the Florida USGS location data (Pinellas County, Fred Howard Park area in Holiday, FL) to specific five-digit ZIP codes covering that geographic area. The execution results show:\n\n**Task Completion Summary:**\n1. **Location Research**: Successfully identified the target location as Fred Howard Park area in Holiday, FL, Pinellas County\n2. **ZIP Code Identification**: Found 3 five-digit ZIP codes covering the area:\n   - 34689: Fred Howard Park entrance area (1700 Sunset Point Rd, Tarpon Springs)\n   - 34690: Primary ZIP code for Holiday, FL\n   - 34691: Secondary ZIP code for Holiday, FL area\n3. **Validation**: All ZIP codes validated as proper 5-digit formats using regex\n4. **Cross-referencing**: Used multiple sources including USPS data, local government records, and geographic mapping to ensure accuracy\n5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive details gathered for each ZIP code including coverage areas and relationship to Fred Howard Park\n6. **Output**: Results saved to workspace/florida_zip_codes.json with complete metadata\n\n**Files Created:**\n- workspace/florida_zip_codes.json: Contains complete ZIP code mapping with detailed information, summary data, and verification that all three ZIP codes cover the Fred Howard Park area where the clownfish specimen was documented\n\n**Final Result:** The three five-digit ZIP codes (34689, 34690, 34691) successfully represent the geographic area specified in the USGS record for the clownfish specimen location. The task has been completed with 100% PLAN alignment as confirmed by the tester feedback.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted: (1) Identified the main character fish from Finding Nemo as Amphiprion ocellaris (clown anemonefish), (2) Located USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database record (Specimen ID: 1468741) documenting a nonnative occurrence in 2018 in Florida, which meets the &#x27;before 2020&#x27; requirement, (3) Converted the location data (Pinellas County, Fred Howard Park area in Holiday, FL) to specific five-digit ZIP codes covering that geographic area.

<p>### Development Step 3: USGS Records of Clownfish Non-native U.S. Occurrences (Pre-2020) with Zip Codes</p>
<p>**Description**: Identify the main character fish species from the movie Finding Nemo and then search for USGS databases or reports documenting nonnative fish species occurrences in the United States before 2020. Focus on finding official USGS records that include specific location data with zip codes for where this species was found as an invasive or nonnative population.</p>

<p>### Development Step 9: USGS Zip Code Records of Invasive Clownfish (Finding Nemo) in U.S. Pre-2020</p>
<p>**Description**: Identify the main character fish species from the movie Finding Nemo and then search for USGS databases or reports documenting nonnative fish species occurrences in the United States before 2020. Focus on finding official USGS records that include specific location data with zip codes for where this species was found as an invasive or nonnative population.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Environmental consulting firms mapping invasive clownfish occurrences with zip code detail to advise coastal development on habitat restoration<br>- Marine biologists conducting PhD research on Amphiprion ocellaris invasion dynamics, using pre-2020 USGS records with zip-coded locations to model spread patterns<br>- State wildlife management agencies automating monitoring of nonnative fish sightings by integrating scraped USGS Florida occurrence data into GIS dashboards for resource allocation<br>- Tourism operators assessing reef health risks by referencing zip-coded nonnative fish occurrence records to adjust dive site offerings and minimize ecological impact<br>- Aquarium trade regulatory bodies cross-referencing import permit zones with USGS occurrence zip code data to enforce nonnative species control policies<br>- Data scientists developing interactive conservation dashboards for NGOs, feeding scraped USGS zip-coded occurrence records into visualizations highlighting invasion hotspots<br>- Coastal infrastructure planners incorporating historical nonnative clownfish distribution by zip code into environmental impact assessments for permit approvals<br>- Biodiversity informatics teams enriching local marine species databases with USGS-sourced nonnative fish records, complete with zip codes and temporal filters for advanced spatial analysis</p>

<p>### Development Step 11: Finding Nemo Clownfish and USGS Pre-2020 Non-Native Occurrence Records by ZIP Code</p>
<p>**Description**: Identify the main character fish species from the movie Finding Nemo and then search for USGS databases or reports documenting nonnative fish species occurrences in the United States before 2020. Focus on finding official USGS records that include specific location data with zip codes for where this species was found as an invasive or nonnative population.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Invasive species monitoring and GIS-based management for state wildlife agencies tracking nonnative clownfish occurrences<br>- Environmental impact assessments and permit compliance reporting for coastal development planners using precise zip code data<br>- Academic research on marine invasive species distribution and statistical modeling for university ecology departments<br>- Conservation NGO field coordination and eradication campaign planning with detailed USGS location records and ZIP code integration<br>- Fisheries management and policy evaluation for local government teams assessing nonnative fish control measures in Florida<br>- Ecotourism safety briefings and public outreach materials development for park rangers at Fred Howard Park and surrounding areas<br>- Citizen science project integration and mobile app geolocation alerts for volunteer biologists monitoring clownfish invasions<br>- Environmental education curriculum design and interactive mapping modules for middle and high school science teachers focusing on nonnative species ecology</p>

                <div class="content-text"><p>Partial success - Code executed without errors and successfully accessed the USGS NAS database, extracting 2 confirmed nonindigenous crocodile species records from Florida: Morelet&#x27;s Crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii) and Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus). The extraction identified both species as exotic/nonindigenous crocodilians in the Crocodylidae family. However, the current extraction lacks the critical timeframe and specimen count data required by the **PLAN**. The records show 0 Florida-specific location details and 0 records within the target 2000-2020 timeframe, indicating the tabular data doesn&#x27;t contain the detailed occurrence information needed. **PLAN** alignment: 60% complete - species identification successful, but missing location data, specimen counts, and collection dates. Next step: Access the individual crocodile species profile pages (Collection info, Point Map links) found in the &#x27;More info&#x27; column to extract detailed occurrence records with dates, locations, and specimen counts for the 2000-2020 period. The code should follow the species links to get the actual collection/occurrence data rather than just the species list summary.</p></div>

                <div class="content-text"><p>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and achieved the **PLAN** objective by extracting detailed occurrence records from the USGS NAS database. The code successfully identified 2 nonindigenous crocodile species (Morelet&#x27;s Crocodile and Nile Crocodile) and accessed their individual collection pages to extract 8 target records from Florida within the 2000-2020 timeframe. However, there&#x27;s a critical data interpretation error: the code incorrectly used Specimen IDs as specimen counts, resulting in an inflated total of 8,291,936 crocodiles. The Specimen IDs (like 1738013, 1634169) are database identifiers, not specimen quantities - each record represents 1 individual crocodile. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete with data correction needed. The actual total should be 8 individual nonindigenous crocodiles documented in Florida (2000-2020): 2 Morelet&#x27;s Crocodiles and 6 Nile Crocodiles. Recommendation: Update the specimen counting logic to count records (not use Specimen IDs as quantities) and save the corrected final count to the results file. The core objective has been achieved - all required data elements (species identification, location data, dates, and total count) have been successfully extracted from the USGS NAS database.</p></div>

=== PLAN COMPLETION STATUS - CORRECTED ===

✓ USGS NAS database accessed successfully
✓ Crocodile species identified: 2
✓ Collection/occurrence data extracted
✓ Records filtered for Florida location
✓ Records filtered for 2000-2020 timeframe
✓ Specimen counts CORRECTED (each record = 1 individual)
✓ Total count calculated accurately

Corrected results saved to: workspace_48eb8242-1099-4c26-95d4-ef22b002457a/usgs_crocodile_florida_2000_2020_corrected_final_results.json

*** PLAN OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED - CORRECTED TOTALS ***

Final Answer: 8 nonindigenous crocodiles
were documented in Florida between 2000-2020 from USGS NAS database records.

Species breakdown:
  • Morelet&#x27;s Crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii): 2 individuals
  • Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus): 6 individuals

Data Quality Notes:
  - Each occurrence record represents 1 individual crocodile
  - Specimen IDs are database identifiers, not specimen quantities
  - All records verified for Florida location and 2000-2020 timeframe
  - Data source: USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database</div>

The corrected analysis properly identifies that Specimen IDs are database identifiers, not specimen quantities, with each occurrence record representing 1 individual crocodile. The final corrected totals show 8 nonindigenous crocodiles documented in Florida between 2000-2020: 2 Morelet&#x27;s Crocodiles (Crocodylus moreletii) and 6 Nile Crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus). The code provides comprehensive details including specific years (2009-2018), counties (Palm Beach, Miami-Dade), and localities for each record. All **PLAN** requirements have been fully met: (1) USGS NAS database successfully accessed, (2) Crocodile species identified with scientific names, (3) Location data extracted (Florida counties and specific sites), (4) Collection/observation dates within 2000-2020 timeframe confirmed, (5) Accurate total count calculated. The corrected results are saved to &#x27;usgs_crocodile_florida_2000_2020_corrected_final_results.json&#x27; with detailed breakdown by species and year. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete. No further development is needed - the objective to determine the total number of nonindigenous crocodiles documented in Florida during the 21-year period has been achieved with the corrected answer of 8 individual crocodiles.</p></div>

I&#x27;m using multiple targeted search queries to find: (1) Direct USGS NAS database links, (2) Crocodile/reptile species records, (3) Florida-specific occurrence data, and (4) Database interfaces for species searches. The code analyzes each result for USGS relevance, crocodile content, and database functionality, then saves comprehensive search results and creates a target investigation plan. This establishes the foundation for accessing the actual USGS NAS database to extract specific crocodile occurrence records with species identification, location data, specimen counts, and dates from the specified 21-year timeframe. The next step will be to access the identified USGS NAS database links to search for and extract the actual crocodile records.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully identified the USGS NAS database with multiple direct links to crocodile species records in Florida.

Key findings include specific crocodile species profiles (American crocodile, Common Caiman, Morelet&#x27;s Crocodile, Nile Crocodile) and a direct database query URL pre-filtered for Florida crocodile records.

I&#x27;m first inspecting the search results file structure to understand available data, then extracting priority USGS NAS database URLs. The code categorizes URLs by type (species profiles, collection data, query interfaces) and prioritizes the pre-filtered Florida crocodile query URL found in the search results. It then accesses the target URL, parses HTML content, and extracts crocodile species data from tables, looking for: (1) Species identification and scientific names, (2) Location data (Florida-specific), (3) Collection/observation dates within 2000-2020 timeframe, (4) Specimen counts and occurrence details. If no tabular data is found, it searches for crocodile species profile links for further investigation. The code saves extraction results and provides detailed analysis of crocodile records found, filtering for the target timeframe and location. This advances the PLAN by directly accessing the USGS database to extract actual occurrence records rather than just search results.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Partial success - Code executed without errors and successfully accessed the USGS NAS database, extracting 2 confirmed nonindigenous crocodile species records from Florida: Morelet&#x27;s Crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii) and Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus). The extraction identified both species as exotic/nonindigenous crocodilians in the Crocodylidae family. However, the current extraction lacks the critical timeframe and specimen count data required by the **PLAN**. The records show 0 Florida-specific location details and 0 records within the target 2000-2020 timeframe, indicating the tabular data doesn&#x27;t contain the detailed occurrence information needed. **PLAN** alignment: 60% complete - species identification successful, but missing location data, specimen counts, and collection dates. Next step: Access the individual crocodile species profile pages (Collection info, Point Map links) found in the &#x27;More info&#x27; column to extract detailed occurrence records with dates, locations, and specimen counts for the 2000-2020 period. The code should follow the species links to get the actual collection/occurrence data rather than just the species list summary.&quot;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &#x27;Code Output: \n\n=== ACCESSING USGS NAS DATABASE FOR CROCODILE RECORDS (2000-2020) ===\n\nObjective: Extract nonindigenous crocodile species records from Florida (2000-2020)\nTarget: Species identification, location data, specimen counts, and collection dates\n\nUsing workspace directory: workspace_48eb8242-1099-4c26-95d4-ef22b002457a\n\n=== INSPECTING SEARCH RESULTS FILE STRUCTURE ===\n\nFile: workspace_48eb8242-1099-4c26-95d4-ef22b002457a/usgs_crocodile_search_results.json\nFile size: 62,747 bytes\n\nTop-level structure analysis:\n  target_objective: str\n  search_queries_used: list\n    Items: 5\n  total_searches_conducted: int\n  search_results_by_query: list\n    Items: 5\n  summary: dict\n    Sub-keys: [\&#x27;total_results_found\&#x27;, \&#x27;usgs_sources_identified\&#x27;, \&#x27;crocodile_sources\&#x27;, \&#x27;database_sources\&#x27;]...\n\n=== EXTRACTING PRIORITY USGS NAS DATABASE URLS ===\n\nFound 21 unique USGS NAS database URLs\n\nCategorized URLs:\n  Species Profile URLs: 8\n  Collection Data URLs: 2\n  Query/Search URLs: 1\n  General URLs: 10\n\n=== ACCESSING TARGET USGS NAS DATABASE URL ===\n\nTarget URL: https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/SpeciesList.aspx?specimennumber=&amp;group=&amp;state=FL&amp;family=&amp;genus=&amp;species=&amp;comname=Crocodile&amp;status=0&amp;YearFrom=&amp;YearTo=&amp;fmb=0&amp;pathway=0&amp;nativeexotic=0&amp;eDNA=&amp;Sortby=1&amp;size=50\nTitle: Disclaimer\nType: direct_nas_database\nSnippet: Morelet\&#x27;s Crocodile, Collection info · Point Map · Species Profile · Animated Map, Freshwater, Exotic ...

I first inspect the extraction results file structure to understand the crocodile species found, then construct species-specific URLs for Collection Info pages using known species IDs (Morelet&#x27;s Crocodile: 3335, Nile Crocodile: 2273). The code accesses each species&#x27; Collection Info page, parses HTML tables to extract occurrence records, and filters for: (1) Florida location data, (2) 2000-2020 timeframe, (3) Specimen counts and collection details. It analyzes each record for target criteria, calculates total specimens documented, and provides species-specific breakdowns. The code saves comprehensive final results and determines the total number of nonindigenous crocodiles documented in Florida during the 21-year period. This completes the PLAN by extracting actual occurrence data with dates, locations, and specimen counts rather than just species listings, providing the definitive answer to the total count question.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and achieved the **PLAN** objective by extracting detailed occurrence records from the USGS NAS database. The code successfully identified 2 nonindigenous crocodile species (Morelet&#x27;s Crocodile and Nile Crocodile) and accessed their individual collection pages to extract 8 target records from Florida within the 2000-2020 timeframe. However, there&#x27;s a critical data interpretation error: the code incorrectly used Specimen IDs as specimen counts, resulting in an inflated total of 8,291,936 crocodiles. The Specimen IDs (like 1738013, 1634169) are database identifiers, not specimen quantities - each record represents 1 individual crocodile. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete with data correction needed. The actual total should be 8 individual nonindigenous crocodiles documented in Florida (2000-2020): 2 Morelet&#x27;s Crocodiles and 6 Nile Crocodiles. Recommendation: Update the specimen counting logic to count records (not use Specimen IDs as quantities) and save the corrected final count to the results file. The core objective has been achieved - all required data elements (species identification, location data, dates, and total count) have been successfully extracted from the USGS NAS database.&quot;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &quot;Code Output: \n\n=== ACCESSING INDIVIDUAL CROCODILE SPECIES PROFILES FOR DETAILED OCCURRENCE DATA ===\n\nObjective: Extract detailed occurrence

The code provides detailed breakdown by species and year, showing the 8 individual nonindigenous crocodiles documented in Florida (2000-2020): 2 Morelet&#x27;s Crocodiles and 6 Nile Crocodiles. This completes the PLAN objective with accurate data interpretation, providing the correct total count of nonindigenous crocodiles with species identification, location data, specimen counts, and collection dates from the USGS NAS database for the specified 21-year period.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully corrected the critical data interpretation error from the previous analysis. The corrected analysis properly identifies that Specimen IDs are database identifiers, not specimen quantities, with each occurrence record representing 1 individual crocodile. The final corrected totals show 8 nonindigenous crocodiles documented in Florida between 2000-2020: 2 Morelet&#x27;s Crocodiles (Crocodylus moreletii) and 6 Nile Crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus). The code provides comprehensive details including specific years (2009-2018), counties (Palm Beach, Miami-Dade), and localities for each record. All **PLAN** requirements have been fully met: (1) USGS NAS database successfully accessed, (2) Crocodile species identified with scientific names, (3) Location data extracted (Florida counties and specific sites), (4) Collection/observation dates within 2000-2020 timeframe confirmed, (5) Accurate total count calculated. The corrected results are saved to &#x27;usgs_crocodile_florida_2000_2020_corrected_final_results.json&#x27; with detailed breakdown by species and year. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete.
