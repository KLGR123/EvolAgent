    "plan": 'Search for and access the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database to locate records of nonindigenous crocodile species found in Florida between the years 2000 and 2020. Extract all crocodile occurrence records from this timeframe, including species identification, location data, specimen counts, and collection/observation dates to determine the total number of nonindigenous crocodiles documented during this 21-year period.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to locate the official USGS NAS database and identify the specific search parameters for crocodile species in Florida during 2000-2020, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this query, (3) Expected outcome is to access the database and extract comprehensive crocodile occurrence data with specimen counts and temporal verification, (4) This directly targets the specific question about nonindigenous crocodile numbers in Florida during the specified timeframe as requested in the TASK',

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted by the developer: (1) The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database was successfully accessed and searched for crocodile species records in Florida during 2000-2020, (2) All nonindigenous crocodile occurrence records were extracted and analyzed, including species identification, location data, specimen counts, and collection dates, (3) The data was properly filtered for the specified timeframe and geographic location, (4) Two crocodile species were identified: Morelet's Crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii) with 2 individuals and Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) with 6 individuals, documented across multiple years (2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2018). Final answer: 8 nonindigenous crocodiles were found in Florida from 2000 through 2020 according to the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database.",
