  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine the count of nonindigenous crocodiles documented in Florida from 2000-2020 using USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database. All three members conducted systematic searches of the USGS NAS database but reached dramatically different conclusions. Member 1 evaluation: Conducted exhaustive search across 898+ species profiles using multiple methodologies including taxonomic filters, targeted species searches, and keyword searches. Found zero crocodilian records with proper exclusion of amphibian false positives. Demonstrated high methodological rigor with comprehensive verification approaches. Member 2 evaluation: Focused on 5 specific crocodilian species from Crocodylidae family, accessed official database systematically, but also concluded zero Florida records for the timeframe. Showed good taxonomic understanding and proper geographic/temporal filtering. Member 3 evaluation: Claims to have found 13 specimens (11 Caiman crocodilus, 2 Crocodylus moreletii) but this contradicts the other two comprehensive analyses. The claimed detailed records appear inconsistent with Members 1 and 2's systematic database exploration. Cross-analysis reveals: Strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on zero findings using different but complementary methodologies. Member 3's positive findings are isolated and lack corroboration from independent systematic searches. Divergence resolution: Members 1 and 2 employed more rigorous systematic approaches with multiple verification methods, while Member 3's methodology lacks sufficient detail about database access verification. Integration assessment: The convergent evidence from two independent systematic analyses using different methodological approaches provides high confidence in the zero finding. Member 1's approach demonstrated superior analytical rigor with exhaustive search methodology and proper false positive identification.",
