  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine the exact number of nonindigenous crocodiles documented in Florida from 2000-2020 using the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database, requiring precise data extraction and accurate counting methodology. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 reported 79 records but critically misunderstood the task by counting database 'records' rather than individual crocodile specimens, and incorrectly included Crocodylus acutus (American Crocodile) which is indigenous to Florida, not nonindigenous. Member 2 correctly identified the need to count individual specimens rather than database records, properly excluded indigenous species, and documented 8 individual crocodiles from 2 species (Morelet's Crocodile: 2, Nile Crocodile: 6) with accurate temporal filtering. Member 3 demonstrated the most comprehensive approach, systematically processing all crocodilian species in the database, correctly identifying 10 individual specimens from 3 nonindigenous species: Morelet's Crocodile (2 specimens, 2018), Nile Crocodile (6 specimens, 2009-2014), and Dwarf Caiman (2 specimens, 2008), with complete documentation including specimen IDs, locations, and verification sources. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on Morelet's and Nile crocodile counts between Members 2 and 3, but Member 3 additionally identified Dwarf Caiman records that Member 2 missed. Critical divergence: Member 1's fundamental misunderstanding of task requirements (records vs. specimens, indigenous vs. nonindigenous species) invalidates their result. Integration assessment: Member 3's methodology provides the most thorough species coverage and accurate specimen counting. Final validation confirms 10 individual nonindigenous crocodiles documented in Florida during 2000-2020 timeframe.",
