# Planner Initialization

## Task
How many nonindigenous crocodiles were found in Florida from the year 2000 through 2020? You can get the data from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database.

## Episodic Examples
### List Pre-2020 US Zip Codes for Invasive Clownfish Sightings

**TASK**: I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.

    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to first confirm the fish species from Finding Nemo (likely clownfish/Amphiprioninae) and then locate USGS nonnative species databases, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this topic, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the target species and find USGS documentation of nonnative occurrences with geographic specificity, (4) This directly targets finding the zip code locations where the species was documented as nonnative before 2020 as requested in the TASK',

The species is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List.\n\n**Measurement Type Confirmation**: The data explicitly states "specimens" indicating individual penguins rather than breeding pairs, which directly addresses the PLAN requirement to note whether the figure represents breeding pairs or individual penguins.\n\n**Research Process Summary**:\n1. Conducted systematic Google searches targeting Wikipedia pages with chinstrap penguin population data\n2. Identified 39 total search results across 4 targeted queries\n3. Located the primary Wikipedia page "Chinstrap penguin" containing the target information\n4. Fetched and parsed the HTML content using multiple extraction methods\n5. Applied regex pattern matching to isolate the specific 2018 IUCN population statement\n6. Verified the data through conservation status section analysis\n7.
