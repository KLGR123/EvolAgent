## Execution History

{
    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": "Parse and analyze both attached files: the job listing PDF (data/gaia/2023/validation/bfcd99e1-0690-4b53-a85c-0174a8629083/Job Listing.pdf) and the applicants Excel file (data/gaia/2023/validation/bfcd99e1-0690-4b53-a85c-0174a8629083/Applicants.xlsx). Extract the complete job requirements and qualifications from the PDF, then extract all applicant information and their qualifications from the Excel file. Compare each applicant's qualifications against the job requirements to identify which applicants are missing exactly one qualification.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand both the job requirements structure and applicant qualification data before determining qualification gaps, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on these files, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete job requirements list and all applicant qualification profiles extracted and organized, (4) This provides the foundation needed to systematically compare each applicant against requirements and count those missing exactly one qualification as requested in the TASK',
