# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for the official script of Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11 ('Heaven Sent') to identify the exact location name as it appears in the first scene heading where the Doctor is trapped in the ever-shifting maze. Look for official BBC sources, script databases, or archived production materials that contain the authentic script with original scene headings and location descriptions.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate the official script for Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11 to find the exact location name as written in the scene headings, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the authentic script text showing how the maze location is officially designated in the first scene heading, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement for the setting name exactly as it appears in the official script's scene heading

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 3: Find and Transcribe Teal’c’s Response to “Isn’t That Hot?” in YouTube Video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Fan-driven Stargate quote archive: automatically download key scenes from YouTube, extract Teal’c’s “Isn’t that hot?” response, transcribe the dialogue and timestamp for inclusion in a community-maintained quote database
- Linguistic analysis of fictional dialects: pull audio clips of Teal’c’s speech from YouTube, transcribe targeted question-and-answer exchanges, and analyze phonetic patterns for a research paper on constructed languages
- Streaming subtitle generation and localization: isolate the “Isn’t that hot?” segment, produce a precise transcript of Teal’c’s reply, and feed it into a translation workflow to create accurate subtitles in multiple languages
- AI chatbot persona training for Sci-Fi characters: collect authentic Teal’c responses by downloading and transcribing specific lines, then integrate them into a chatbot to emulate his speech style in interactive fan applications
- Compliance audit for clip licensing: extract and document exact dialogue segments from YouTube videos, log Teal’c’s reply verbatim, and attach metadata for legal review when securing broadcast rights
- Podcast episode highlight reel: automate the download, audio extraction, and transcription of fan-favorite Teal’c lines like his response to “Isn’t that hot?”, then assemble them into a curated nostalgia segment
- Quality assurance for automatic captioning services: use the known “Isn’t that hot?” exchange to verify the accuracy of speech-to-text algorithms by comparing the system’s output to the manually extracted transcript
- Educational media analysis in film studies: retrieve and transcribe Teal’c’s concise responses from selected YouTube scenes, enabling film students to examine character development through repeated dialogue patterns

### Development Step 8: Locate and Transcribe Teal’c’s Response to “Isn’t That Hot?” in SG-1 YouTube Clip

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated quality assurance for call centers by transcribing customer support calls, locating when a customer says “cancel my subscription,” and extracting the agent’s exact response for compliance review
- Digital archiving of corporate training videos, searching for the phrase “safety hazard” in noisy plant footage and documenting the instructor’s follow-up instructions for audit trails
- Film post-production localization workflows that identify and time-stamp a character’s catchphrase (e.g., “bring me the code”) in raw footage and export the translated dialogue script for subtitling
- E-learning content indexing by detecting when an instructor asks “any questions?” in recorded lectures and automatically generating navigation bookmarks around the ensuing student Q&A segment
- Legal deposition analysis where court reporters transcribe lengthy audio, search for the question “do you recall?” and extract the deponent’s precise answer for exhibit preparation
- Manufacturing process monitoring that captures machine alarms (e.g., “overheat warning”) from workshop audio, transcribes the alert, and logs the technician’s acknowledgment response for incident tracking
- Wildlife research audio analysis in the field, identifying when a rare bird call (“tu-weet”) occurs in background recordings and extracting the surrounding researcher commentary for ecological studies
- Podcast production automation that scans recorded episodes for explicit sponsor cue phrases (e.g., “today’s episode is brought to you by”) and isolates the host’s tailored ad read for editing and insertion

### Development Step 6: Locate “Isn’t that hot?” exchange and transcribe Teal’c’s exact response from the YouTube video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Customer support call transcription and specific complaint keyword spotting for quality assurance in contact centers
- Lecture video transcription and student question‐answer extraction for e-learning platforms
- Surveillance audio analysis and suspicious phrase detection for security operations in law enforcement
- Focus group session transcription and sentiment keyword identification for product development teams
- Archival broadcast video indexing and catchphrase search for media libraries and content distributors
- Medical consultation recording transcription and symptom keyword extraction for electronic health record enhancement
- Podcast episode transcription and topic segment annotation for content creators and publishers
- Legal deposition video transcription and critical phrase highlighting for law firms and court reporting services

### Development Step 24: Search for 17th-Century Chronicles Documenting Irish Spectral Army and Supernatural Events

**Description**: Search for historical documents from the 17th century that record both a spectral army apparition in Ireland and unusual supernatural events. Focus on identifying chronicles, historical accounts, or antiquarian records from that period that document both phenomena. Look for works by historians, chroniclers, or antiquarians who recorded supernatural occurrences across Britain and Ireland during the 1600s, as this dual documentation will help identify the specific source that M.R. James likely used for his Suffolk spider curse inspiration.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical archives digitization team extracting and cataloging 17th-century Irish chronicle references to spectral army accounts for curating a specialized research database
- Folklore studies department automatically processing HTML transcripts of digitized manuscripts to identify supernatural event descriptions for publication in an annotated monograph on ghostly warfare traditions
- Digital humanities lab analyzing online repositories of Gaelic annals to map temporal occurrences of phantom armies for thesis-level quantitative analysis and interactive visualization
- Cultural heritage organization mining local council website archives to extract narratives of spectral apparitions for designing an immersive museum exhibit on Irish supernatural folklore
- Paranormal documentary producers scanning web-hosted historical chronicles to source authentic supernatural event descriptions for episode scripts on spectral phenomena in Ireland

### Development Step 9: Extract and Transcribe "Isn't That Hot?" Dialogue and Teal’c’s Reply from YouTube Video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal video evidence processing to transcribe courtroom footage and extract witness statements containing specific phrases for case preparation
- Customer support call QA automation by transcribing recorded service calls to identify “I’m not satisfied” or similar complaint triggers for supervisor review
- Market research on product demo videos to locate and compile user feedback comments like “this feature is great” for prioritizing development roadmaps
- Social media moderation by analyzing livestreams to detect and flag policy-violating language in real time for compliance teams
- Educational lecture indexing to transcribe university seminars, tag question-and-answer segments, and enable students to search for “Can you explain...” queries
- Media production highlight creation by extracting memorable soundbites from celebrity interviews (“That was awesome!”) for promotional reels
- Accessibility caption generation for online courses by transcribing instructor dialogue and identifying speaker changes for precise subtitle synchronization
- Linguistic research on archival broadcasts to automatically transcribe and analyze usage patterns of phrases such as “Do you really think...” across decades
