    "plan": "Search for the official script of Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11 ('Heaven Sent') to identify the exact location name as it appears in the first scene heading where the Doctor is trapped in the ever-shifting maze. Look for official BBC sources, script databases, or archived production materials that contain the authentic script with original scene headings and location descriptions.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate the official script for Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11 to find the exact location name as written in the scene headings, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the authentic script text showing how the maze location is officially designated in the first scene heading, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement for the setting name exactly as it appears in the official script's scene heading",

    "description": 'After multiple comprehensive search attempts and analysis phases, I have determined that the specific objective cannot be completed with the available resources. Here\'s a detailed summary of the extensive work performed:\n\n**SEARCH PHASES COMPLETED:**\n1. **Official BBC Script Search**: Systematically searched BBC Writersroom, BBC Programme pages, and official script repositories. Result: Official scripts are not publicly available.\n\n2. **Transcript Database Search**: Accessed Tardis Data Core (Fandom), Chakoteya transcripts, and other Doctor Who fan sites. Successfully obtained 562KB of Heaven Sent content from Tardis Data Core.\n\n3. **Content Analysis**: Performed multiple detailed analyses of the saved transcript content using various pattern matching approaches, filtering methods, and text extraction techniques.\n\n**TECHNICAL ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:**\n- The saved transcript content (562KB) appears to be primarily wiki-style episode analysis rather than scene-by-scene script format\n- Multiple attempts at text extraction yielded fragmented results and production notes rather than authentic scene headings\n- Pattern matching captured behind-the-scenes content and production metadata instead of actual script locations\n- The plot section extraction in the final attempt only captured 20 characters instead of full content, indicating fundamental parsing issues\n\n**KEY FINDINGS:**\n- Strong contextual evidence points to "Confession Dial" as the overarching location\n- Multiple references to "Castle" within the Confession Dial as the specific setting\n- References to "teleporter chamber" as the Doctor\'s materialization point\n- However, none of these could be definitively confirmed as the exact wording from the original script\'s first scene heading\n\n**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**\nThe core issue is that authentic BBC production scripts with original scene headings are not publicly accessible. The available fan transcripts and wiki content provide episode summaries and analysis but do not contain the specific scene heading format that would appear in an official shooting script (e.g., "INT. CONFESSION DIAL - TELEPORTER CHAMBER - DAY").\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nThe objective to find "the exact location name as it appears in the first scene heading" of the official BBC script cannot be completed because:\n1. Official BBC scripts are not publicly available\n2. Available transcript sources do not contain authentic scene heading formats\n3. The specific wording used in the original script\'s scene headings remains inaccessible\n\nWhile substantial evidence suggests the location involves the Confession Dial castle/teleporter chamber setting, the exact scene heading terminology as written by Steven Moffat in the original script cannot be determined from publicly available sources.\n\n**FILES CREATED:** 9 analysis files totaling 1.3MB of research data have been saved to workspace for future reference, including comprehensive search results and detailed content analysis.',

    "plan": 'Search for alternative sources of the official Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11 script including production databases, script repositories, archived BBC materials, or fan communities that may have preserved authentic script excerpts. Focus specifically on finding the exact scene heading format that would appear in the original shooting script for the opening scene where the Doctor materializes in the maze-like castle environment.',
    "description": "This follow-up search is necessary because: (1) The previous comprehensive search established that official BBC scripts aren't publicly available and fan transcripts don't contain authentic scene heading formats, (2) We need to explore additional avenues such as production archives, leaked script excerpts, or specialized Doctor Who script collections that might contain the original scene heading text, (3) Expected outcome is to locate authentic script material showing the exact wording used in the first scene heading as it appears in the official script, (4) This addresses the specific TASK requirement for the setting name exactly as written in the scene heading format rather than episode summaries or fan interpretations",

    "description": 'After conducting extensive searches across multiple phases including professional script databases, archived BBC materials, fan communities, and production sources, I have determined that the specific objective cannot be completed with available public resources. Here\'s a comprehensive summary of the search efforts:\n\n**COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH PHASES COMPLETED:**\n1. **Professional Script Database Search**: Systematically searched Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDB), Script-O-Rama, Simply Scripts, Script Lab, Script Reader Pro, BBC Writers Room, and Script City. Result: No official Heaven Sent scripts located in public databases.\n\n2. **Archived BBC Materials Search**: Accessed BBC Programme Archive, British Film Institute Database, Writers Guild Archive, and BAFTA archives for production materials. Result: Multiple 404 errors, indicating content removal or restricted access.\n\n3. **Fan Community Search**: Searched Gallifrey Base Forum, Doctor Who Reddit, Chakoteya transcripts, Doctor Who Guide, and Outpost Gallifrey Archive. Result: Most sources returned 404/502 errors or lacked authentic script content.\n\n4. **Production Sources Search**: Attempted to access BBC iPlayer production notes, Doctor Who TV official site, and Steven Moffat interview archives. Result: All sources returned 404 errors, indicating content no longer publicly available.\n\n**TECHNICAL ANALYSIS ATTEMPTS:**\nMultiple detailed analyses were performed on the saved 562KB Tardis Data Core transcript content, but encountered critical issues:\n- Text extraction yielded only 20 characters instead of full plot content\n- Pattern matching captured production notes rather than authentic scene headings\n- Location identification logic produced meaningless fragments like \'itself\' instead of actual location names\n- Previous attempts consistently identified \'Confession Dial\' and \'Castle\' as strong candidates but failed to definitively extract the exact scene heading format\n\n**CORE CHALLENGE IDENTIFIED:**\nThe fundamental issue is that authentic BBC production scripts containing the exact scene heading format (e.g., "INT. CONFESSION DIAL - CASTLE - DAY") are not publicly accessible. Official scripts require:\n- BBC licensing agreements\n- Writers Guild permissions\n- Production company authorization\n- Special academic or industry access\n\n**KEY FINDINGS FROM AVAILABLE SOURCES:**\n- Contextual evidence strongly suggests the location involves the Confession Dial\n- Multiple references point to a castle setting within the Confession Dial\n- The Doctor materializes via teleporter in the opening scene\n- Fan transcripts and episode summaries consistently describe the maze-like castle environment\n- However, none provide the exact wording as it appears in the original shooting script\n\n**FILES CREATED:** 13+ analysis files totaling over 1.5MB of research data including:\n- Comprehensive search results from multiple source categories\n- Detailed content analysis from available transcript sources\n- Production material searches and fan community investigations\n- Technical analysis attempts with various extraction methodologies\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nThe objective to find "the exact location name as it appears in the first scene heading" of the official BBC production script cannot be completed because:\n1. Official BBC scripts are not publicly available through any accessible channels\n2. Professional script databases do not contain current BBC Doctor Who scripts\n3. Fan transcripts provide episode summaries but not authentic script formatting\n4. The specific scene heading terminology used by Steven Moffat in the original script remains proprietary\n\nWhile substantial evidence indicates the first scene location involves the Confession Dial castle/teleporter chamber setting, the exact scene heading format as written in the official shooting script cannot be determined from publicly available sources.',
