    "description": 'This implementation searches for the official Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 (Heaven Sent) script to identify the exact location name where the Doctor is trapped in the maze. The approach targets multiple reliable sources: (1) BBC Writers Room for official scripts, (2) Chakoteya.net for comprehensive Doctor Who transcripts, and (3) Internet Archive for archived script documents. The code specifically looks for Heaven Sent transcripts, analyzes scene headings and location references, searches for maze-related content, and extracts the opening scene details. It saves all found content to workspace files for detailed analysis, focusing on identifying the specific location name as it appears in the first scene heading. The script handles various transcript formats and searches for common script formatting patterns like scene headings, location keywords, and maze references to pinpoint the exact location name used in the official script.',

    "feedback": "Execution partially successful - Code ran without errors and successfully accessed the BBC Writers Room, but failed to locate the target script content. The main issue is that the Chakoteya transcript site (which was the most promising source) returned a 404 error, preventing access to the Heaven Sent transcript that the code was designed to analyze. The BBC Writers Room contained no Doctor Who scripts, and Internet Archive yielded no results. Current **PLAN** alignment: 20% - search infrastructure works but no actual script content was retrieved. The code shows good structure for script analysis (scene heading detection, location keyword searching, maze reference identification) but couldn't execute due to source unavailability. Next steps: (1) Try alternative transcript sources like planetclaire.tv/doctorwho, (2) Search for 'Confession Dial' as the likely location name based on episode knowledge, (3) Try different Chakoteya URLs or check if the site has moved, (4) Look for fan transcript sites or Reddit discussions that might contain script excerpts.",

    "description": "This implementation expands the search for the Doctor Who Heaven Sent script by trying alternative transcript sources after the previous Chakoteya attempt failed with a 404 error. The approach now includes: (1) Planet Claire Doctor Who site for comprehensive episode transcripts, (2) Tardis Data Core Wiki for detailed episode information and plot summaries, (3) Alternative Chakoteya URLs in case the site moved, and (4) BBC episode guides. The code specifically searches for location terms like 'Confession Dial', 'Castle', and 'Maze', analyzes plot sections and opening scene descriptions, and creates a comprehensive location analysis based on episode knowledge. It also generates a detailed report with likely scene heading formats based on standard TV script conventions, providing the most probable answer ('CONFESSION DIAL' or 'INT. CONFESSION DIAL - CASTLE') while continuing to search for the official script text to confirm the exact formatting.",

The alternative source search strategy worked well, successfully accessing Planet Claire Doctor Who site and finding a dedicated Heaven Sent page with 17,834 characters of content that contains references to 'confession dial', 'castle', and 'maze'. The Tardis Wiki was also successfully accessed with 66,814 characters of detailed episode information including plot summaries and location analysis. **PLAN** alignment: 75% - substantial script-related content was retrieved and analyzed, though the actual scene heading format still needs to be extracted from the saved files. The code created comprehensive analysis files in workspace including detailed plot sections, location term frequencies, and confession dial contexts. The output is quite lengthy and contains valuable analysis results. Recommendation: Save the detailed terminal output to 'workspace/alternative_search_results.txt' for future reference, then examine the saved Planet Claire and Tardis Wiki files to extract the specific scene heading format for the opening location where the Doctor is trapped in the maze.",

He flips a switch and collapses to the ground, his body fading away into dust, as the teleporter activates, materialising the Doctor inside its chamber. The Doctor steps out of the teleporter, looking around the room. He bends down to grasp some of the sand on the ground, the memory of Clara\'s death still fresh in his mind. He then threatens the ones responsible for bringing him there, promising to never stop until he finds them.\nThe Doctor steps out of the teleporter room and into a circular corridor, filled with windows and a monitor. Looking out one of the windows, he sees that he\'s inside the central tower of a castle. He speaks out to whoever captured him, again, mentioning that the technology in the teleporter means he can only have been moved a maximum of one light year from where he was before, and he knows that he hasn\'t travelled in time, so a\n...

(WC: This is Sergeant Robert Dudley.)\nWhilst the episode was promoted by various news outlets as a one-hander, the presence of an imagined Clara and the Veil, and the appearance of the young boy at the end of the episode, technically go against this; however, the bulk of the storyline was carried by the Doctor alone with him having all but one line of dialogue. The 2013 mini-episode Clara and the TARDIS remains the only true televised one-hander produced to date. The Companion Chronicle The Stealers from Saiph is the only other one-hander.\nThe Doctor\'s story that he tells in the beginning, is written on a wall in the old castle. Only certain parts are missing.\nWhile imagining talking to Clara, the Doctor breaks the fourth wall, looks at the camera and says "I\'m nothing without an audience".\nThe Doctor imagines he\'s in the TARDIS with Clara, who writes responses on the blackboards, whenever he needs to think about a sce\n...

He turns back to see the figure coming closer and closer to him. Unfortunately, he can\'t see a way out of this situation. As the figure reaches for him, the Doctor admits that he is scared of dying, and the figure freezes. The Doctor wonders if this is because of something he said. He notices that even the flies that were buzzing around the figure have also frozen in place.\nA noise causes him to step over to the window. He watches as the sections of the castle begin to revolve, rearranging themselves. He turns back to the door to see the wall slide open. Running through the new opening, the Doctor finds himself in a bedroom.\nThe Doctor grabs one of the flowers but freezes when he notices a portrait of Clara sitting on top of the fireplace. He smiles sadly at the picture, before grabbing a miniature magnifying glass, so he can take a closer look, not noticing the nearby monitor. The monitor is showing that the figure is on the move again, and is entering the bedroom.\n\n     The Doctor mourns Clara.  \nThe Doctor deduces that the painting is very, very old, before noticing a fly on it. He quickly turns and sees the figure. He talks about a time when he was a child. He had seen a dead, old woman, who was covered in veils. It was a hot day, so flies were buzzing around her corpse. The sight of this gave the Doctor nightmares for years. He recognises the figure as that very nightmare...\n\n--- Line 2217 Context ---\nThe Doctor finds a small room, with arrows pointing to a missing section of the stone floor. He looks up at the nearby monitor, noting that the Veil keeps coming for him. He asks why it does that. In the mental TARDIS, Clara writes on a chalkboard again: "Wrong question!" Upon asking her what the right question is, he gets a written response: "Not why. What?"\nThe Doctor walks over to the monitor, pondering on the fact the Veil is tracking him. He realises that the Veil is trying to terrify him, as the monitors are set to show him where it is at all times. The castle and the Veil are a killer puzzle box designed to scare him to death. Smirking, the Doctor comments that it must be Christmas - this is exactly something that would be on his list.\nThe Doctor heads down another corridor that leads him to an outside garden. He notices a rectangular mound of dirt in the centre of the garden, and a spade nearby, which means something is buried beneath the mound that he is supposed to dig up. Grabbing the spade, the Doctor contemplates whether to start digging, as it could be a trap or a clue left by a previous prisoner. After all, the presence of the skulls proves that there were others here before the Doctor. Noting how slow the Veil is moving, the Doctor deduces he has an hour before it arrives, so he starts digging.\nSometime later, the Doctor is still digging, having not found whatever is buried, when he notices flies buzzing near him. Running to the nearby monitor he sees that the Veil is strangely standing in one place, staring at a smooth surface. The Doctor opens the door to leave the garden, only to discover the Veil standing on the other side. The Veil quickly tries to enter the garden, but the Doctor manages the force the door shut, and props the spade against the door in a way to keep it shut. The Veil continues to try to force the door open a few more times, before walking away. The Doctor looks at the monitor and notes that the Veil has walked into the room with the missing section of the floor. Wondering where it\'s going, the Doctor looks around. The door is the only way in or out of the garden. "Well, since you\'re going.." he mumbles and grabs the spade, resuming his dig.\nHours later, when night has fallen, the Doctor stops digging and looks up at the stars. He frowns in confusion, noting something wrong with them, before resuming his digging. His spade hits something. Digging with his hands, the Doctor uncovers the missing section of the floor from the other room. On it, words are written: I AM IN 12. At that moment, the Veil emerges from the ground nearby, having dug its way from the room to the garden.\nThe Doctor walks into his mental TARDIS again, thinking about how he is going to get out of this situation. He tells Clara to ask him a question and she writes something on the chalkboard: "Tell no lies." She then rewrites question two again. The Doctor did note that it was when he admitted to being scared to die, that the Veil stopped. But, it\'s not just the truth that the Doctor\'s captors are trying to get out of him. They want his confessions, the secrets he never tells anyone. The problem is that there are truths the Doctor can never tell, not for anything. But now he is scared and alone.\nBack in the real world, the Doctor confesses that he didn\'t leave Gallifrey all those years ago because he was bored, but because he was scared. The Veil backs off and the castle shifts again. The Doctor quickly climbs out of the hole and escapes from the garden. The Doctor then makes another discovery. The castle is standing in the sea, alone, with no other land anywhere nearby.\nAs time goes on, the Doctor uses his hand to tap out the seconds it takes for the Veil to walk from one side of the castle to the other, where he is, in order to work out how much extra time he can get before the Veil shows up again. He can get 82 minutes to himself if he leaves the Veil in one extreme end of the castle when he runs to the other extreme. Having some soup at one point, the Doctor wonders if the teleportation sent him to Hell; he shrugs off the idea "That\'s okay. Hell\'s just Heaven for bad people." During this, he is trying to locate Room 12, having noticed that the rooms are numbered, but due to the castle rearranging itself, the rooms are not in the correct order. He has also noticed that most rooms after he has left them for a while, reset to the condition they were in before the Doctor arrived.\n\n--- Line 2241 Context ---\nAfter that, the mental TARDIS lights shut off and his real body fades into oblivion, leaving nothing but his skull.\nAt that moment, the teleporter activates, materialising the new Doctor in the chamber, exactly as he was when he first arrived, including the state of his memories, continuing the cycle he has been in for the last 7,000 years, down to what he says in the same tone as he warns whoever brought him there that they will pay for Clara\'s death.\nThe Doctor continues to repeat everything over and over again, each time getting further into the Azbantium wall; he gets a bit more of his story out as the centuries pass. Each time, he is encouraged to continue trying to escape without revealing what he knew about the Hybrid; he continues to accept that he needs to keep fighting on to honour Clara\'s memory. Each time, he knows he has to keep fighting to find out who put him through this hell.\nOver 4 billion years later, the Doctor is punching the Azbantium wall. Just as the Veil is about to touch him, the Doctor\'s last punch cracks the wall and reveals light. The last of the wall crumbles away, showing a white glow. Realising the Veil hasn\'t killed him, the Doctor turns to see it fall apart, revealing it to be made of gears. Telling the mechanical creature his story is "a hell of a bird", the Doctor steps through the opening.\n\n     What is inside the confession dial.  \nThe Doctor exits onto a desert world, looking behind him to see the tunnel of Azbantium. In a flash, the opening closes and the item generating it drops to the ground. Picking it up, the Doctor discovers he had been trapped inside his confession dial the entire time. The castle and sea are then covered by a mass of gears and the cover of the dial comes back over it.\nJust then, a boy runs up to him. The Doctor tells him to go to the city and tell someone important. "Tell them I\'m back. Tell them I know what they did, and I\'m on my way. And if they ask you who I am, tell them I came the long way around." The boy runs off towards the nearby city, revealing that the Doctor is now on Gallifrey.\n\n--- Line 2245 Context ---\n\n     What is inside the confession dial.  \nThe Doctor exits onto a desert world, looking behind him to see the tunnel of Azbantium.

So, just between ourselves, you\'ve got the prophecy wrong. The Hybrid is not half Dalek. Nothing is half Dalek. The Daleks would never allow that. The Hybrid, destined to conquer Gallifrey and stand in its ruins, is me."\n\nCast[]\nThe Doctor - Peter Capaldi\n\n--- Line 2473 Context ---\nA portrait of Clara Oswald is hanging in the castle.\nWhen the Doctor finds \'BIRD\' in the ground, he rhetorically asks if there are birds here.\nThe castle contains screens designed to show what the Veil sees, giving the Doctor clues as to where the Veil is at all times.\nThe Doctor is searching for Room 12.\nThe Doctor finds and generates billions of copies of his own skull.\nThe Doctor at first thinks the castle is inside a closed energy loop.\nCulture from the real world[]\nThe Doctor discusses the Brothers Grimm to the Veil and the tale of the Shepherd\'s Boy, who is asked by the Emperor "how many seconds in eternity?" To this, he replies: "There\'s this mountain of pure diamond. It takes an hour to climb it, and an hour to go around it. Every hundred years, a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on the diamond mountain. And when the entire mountain is chiselled away, the first second of eternity will have passed." The Doctor thinks that\'s "a hell of a bird".\n\n--- Line 2483 Context ---\nThe Doctor compares the teleporter to a 3D printer.\nInfluences[]\nRachel Talalay sought visual inspiration from German Expressionism.\nThe Prisoner - the Doctor is trapped within a castle within which an unidentified entity uses various methods in order to try and extract secret information.\nStory notes[]\n     A quote from the episode appears in a Time Fracture tie-in webcast. (WC: This is Sergeant Robert Dudley.)  \nWhilst the episode was promoted by various news outlets as a one-hander, the presence of an imagined Clara and the Veil, and the appearance of the young boy at the end of the episode, technically go against this; however, the bulk of the storyline was carried by the Doctor alone with him having all but one line of dialogue. The 2013 mini-episode Clara and the TARDIS remains the only true televised one-hander produced to date. The Companion Chronicle The Stealers from Saiph is the only other one-hander.\nThe Doctor\'s story that he tells in the beginning, is written on a wall in the old castle. Only certain parts are missing.\n\n--- Line 2492 Context ---\nThe Doctor imagines he\'s in the TARDIS with Clara, who writes responses on the blackboards, whenever he needs to think about a scenario. This is quite similar to the "mind palace" from Sherlock, a show created and written by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss; Sherlock would review facts and even talk to mental constructs of people he knows when working out a case/problem.\nIn the TV special The Ultimate Time Lord, Steven Moffat had described the Doctor as "an adrenaline junkie. He will toss himself out a window and figure out what to do on the way down." The Doctor does this very thing in the episode. Moffat also joked that "hopeful [as well] if [the Doctor] had a bacon sandwich, he\'d finish it on the way down"\nEach and every one of the skulls in the episode were modelled from Peter Capaldi\'s own skull. The effects team reverse-engineered the shape of his skull from a lifecast that was taken to create the "ghost Doctor" prosthetics for Under the Lake/Before the Flood.[3]\nJenna Coleman\'s name has been removed from the opening credits, making this the first regular episode of the revived series to only credit one actor during the title sequence. To make up for the extra time required, Peter Capaldi\'s name is held on screen for a couple of seconds before moving away, also a first. In keeping with this, in the closing credits, the name of the actor playing the Doctor is seen on screen by itself for the first time, with the companion actress\' credit moved to the second screen.\nUnusually for the title sequence used beginning in 2014, Peter Capaldi\'s credit zooms ahead rather than fading out.\nPrior to the broadcast of Series 8, Steven Moffat stated in interviews that he had already worked out the cliffhanger for the penultimate episode of Series 9, and was quoted as saying "you won\'t see it coming." The Doctor says almost those exact same words before jumping out the window in this episode, the penultimate episode of Series 9 which does, indeed, lead to a major cliffhanger.\nThis marks the only penultimate episode in a series during Steven Moffat\'s era as showrunner to not feature the Cybermen, though as there are only twelve episodes in this series, the following episode continues the pattern of the twelfth episode featuring Cybermen.\nThe only appearance of the TARDIS in this episode is an imaginary version of the console room in the Doctor\'s mind.\n\n--- Line 2515 Context ---\nThe majority of the Doctor\'s fall was completed the next day using a special rig which would allow Peter Capaldi to perform while lying on his back, instead of the usual practice of being suspended from wires.\nThe flies were originally meant to be created with CGI, but there were too many of them to accomplish the effect, so footage of flies was used instead.\nThe Doctor\'s closing comment about the Hybrid was a late addition to the script.\nThe first scenes to be filmed were the TARDIS scenes.\nThe closing scene on Gallifrey was filmed during work on Hell Bent in the Canary Islands.\nAlthough season nine had been granted fifty-minute timeslots for its episodes, it was agreed that the nature of this episode precluded significant edits, and a fifty-five-minute duration was authorised. Nonetheless, some trims were necessary. Notably, the Doctor\'s opening description of the Veil replaced his discovery of a similar message on the wall of the circular corridor, while some of the rooms he was meant to discover in the castle, such as the ballroom, were not shown\nIn a Radio Times interview, Steven Moffat clarified several things, such as the fact that Clara\'s portrait was painted by an earlier Doctor and that the Wall never resets because it\'s part of the Confession Dial outer wall, and not the castle itself. He also revealed that in his mind the first few iterations of the loop went very differently and lasted much longer, until some things such as the clue to look for Room 12 slipped through the dodgy resetting process and allowed for a tighter and more consistent loop that we see in the episode. Further comments in Doctor Who Magazine revealed that one of the "I Am in 12" messages is on the back of Clara\'s portrait, but the Doctor stopped looking for it there as he couldn\'t bear turning Clara\'s face to the wall[8].\nThe premise is similar to that of a script that Steven Moffat mentioned he once considered pitching as a Big Finish Audio story with the Eighth Doctor being stuck alone with a threat that preys on his fears.\n\n--- Line 2541 Context ---\nWhen the Doctor jumps from the window into the water, he passes through a section of the castle on the way down.\nWhen getting out of the water the Doctor\'s suit and skin is visibly dry and his hair only moisturised.\nThe stars barely change from the top of the tower between the scenes at 1,000,000,000 years and 2,000,000,000 years. In a billion years, stars would have moved, new stars would have been born and some some would have become red giants or died.\nWhen the Doctor is calculating how long the chair was falling, lighting in the TARDIS went into normal when camera was facing screen, but then back to emergency (red) lighting when camera switches to the Doctor, and it was happening every time when camera was facing the screen.\nDuring the beginning of montage when the Doctor\'s clone was created, the vfx was missing.\nContinuity[]\nThe Doctor declares to his captors, "the Doctor will see you now". (TV: The Eleventh Hour)\nThe Doctor remembers Clara\'s death and how she told him not to take revenge, as well as telling the reason she got killed; he also refers to the fact she died in agony. (TV: Face the Raven)\n\n--- Line 2552 Context ---\nThe Doctor retreats to the lower level of the mental recreation of the TARDIS console room when he becomes emotional, and sits in almost exactly the same place as the Eleventh Doctor did when faced with an enforced journey to Trenzalore. (TV: The Name of the Doctor)\nThe Doctor says to always assume survival. Clara previously said he always assumes that. (TV: The Witch\'s Familiar)\nExcept for the painting, all of the Doctor\'s visions of Clara have her wearing the same outfit and hairstyle as when she died. Also, except for one encounter, she is always seen from the back, which is how the Doctor last saw her alive. (TV: Face the Raven)\nThe Doctor is once again able to recgonise the artificial nature of the events he is caught up in. (TV: Sleep No More)\nThe Ninth Doctor demonstrated the ability to slow down his perception of time when carrying out a risky action. (TV: The End of the World)\nThe Hybrid is discussed. (TV: The Witch\'s Familiar)\nThe Doctor says the Daleks would never allow anything to be half-Dalek. He has previously witnessed them destroy human-Dalek hybrids (TV: Evolution of the Daleks) and has encountered a race of Daleks harvested from human genetic material who were driven insane by their own existence. (TV: The Parting of the Ways) A hybridisation of a faction of Daleks has also more than once been the cause of civil war. (TV: The Evil of the Daleks, Revelation of the Daleks, Remembrance of the Daleks)\nThe Doctor returns to Gallifrey, having got there "the long way round". (TV: The Day of the Doctor)\n\n=== CONFESSION DIAL CONTEXTS (5 found) ===\n\n--- Context around line 1923 ---\n\nMain setting:\nInside the Doctor\'s confession dial; the Doctor\'s mind palace\n\n\n\n--- Context around line 2150 ---\nHeaven Sent was the eleventh and penultimate episode of series 9 of Doctor Who.\nThe episode shows the Doctor dealing with and grieving over the death of Clara Oswald, whom he lost to the Quantum Shade in the previous episode. The vast majority of the episode includes just the Doctor by himself with no other characters present, save the veiled figure that menaces him throughout. Jenna Coleman appears only as a manifestation of Clara in the Doctor\'s imagination. The Doctor\'s TARDIS is also absent from this episode, except again in the Doctor\'s imagination.\nThe episode is notable for a number of truths conceded by the Doctor, with him being inside his own confession dial. It is also notable for showing the Doctor finally finding his way back to Gallifrey since he found out that it was not in fact destroyed in the Time War, but instead placed in a pocket universe.\nThis story takes place over an outstandingly long period of time, seeing the Doctor stuck in a recursive cycle during which he repeatedly perishes and comes back to life. In the following episode, Hell Bent, it is estimated that this cycle lasts for four and a half billion years, leaving it with one of the single-longest uninterrupted time spans of any given adventure in Doctor Who history.\nIn a 2023 poll by Doctor Who Magazine, Heaven Sent was ranked as the second most popular Twelfth Doctor TV story behind the two-parter World Enough and Time/The Doctor Falls [1][nb 1]. In another DWM poll later that year, Heaven Sent was declared the most popular TV story of the first 60 years of Doctor Who, followed by World Enough and Time/The Doctor Falls.[2]\n\n--- Context around line 2243 ---\nOver 4 billion years later, the Doctor is punching the Azbantium wall. Just as the Veil is about to touch him, the Doctor\'s last punch cracks the wall and reveals light. The last of the wall crumbles away, showing a white glow. Realising the Veil hasn\'t killed him, the Doctor turns to see it fall apart, revealing it to be made of gears. Telling the mechanical creature his story is "a hell of a bird", the Doctor steps through the opening.\n\n     What is inside the confession dial.  \nThe Doctor exits onto a desert world, looking behind him to see the tunnel of Azbantium. In a flash, the opening closes and the item generating it drops to the ground. Picking it up, the Doctor discovers he had been trapped inside his confession dial the entire time. The castle and sea are then covered by a mass of gears and the cover of the dial comes back over it.\nJust then, a boy runs up to him. The Doctor tells him to go to the city and tell someone important. "Tell them I\'m back. Tell them I know what they did, and I\'m on my way. And if they ask you who I am, tell them I came the long way around." The boy runs off towards the nearby city, revealing that the Doctor is now on Gallifrey.\n\n--- Context around line 2244 ---\n\n     What is inside the confession dial.  \nThe Doctor exits onto a desert world, looking behind him to see the tunnel of Azbantium.

    "description": "This implementation analyzes the previously saved Heaven Sent content from Planet Claire and Tardis Wiki to extract the exact scene heading location name. The approach: (1) Inventories all workspace files to identify the most relevant content, (2) Examines Planet Claire HTML/text files for script-like formatting patterns, (3) Inspects existing JSON analysis files for location elements, (4) Searches all content for scene heading patterns using regex, (5) Extracts the specific opening scene description from Tardis Wiki that states 'As gears turn inside the walls of a castle, a mysterious figure makes his way into a room with a teleporter', and (6) Analyzes the location hierarchy (Confession Dial > Castle > Teleporter Room) to determine the most likely scene heading format. Based on the evidence that the Doctor materializes in a teleporter room within a castle inside the Confession Dial, and following standard TV script formatting conventions, the code concludes the first scene heading location name is most likely 'INT. CONFESSION DIAL - TELEPORTER ROOM - DAY' or simply 'CONFESSION DIAL - TELEPORTER ROOM'.",

The script successfully analyzed workspace files from Planet Claire and Tardis Wiki, extracted the crucial opening scene description from Tardis Wiki ('As gears turn inside the walls of a castle, a mysterious figure makes his way into a room with a teleporter'), and determined the most likely scene heading format. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - the code identified that the first scene takes place in a 'TELEPORTER ROOM' within a 'CASTLE' inside the 'CONFESSION DIAL', concluding the most probable scene heading is 'INT. CONFESSION DIAL - TELEPORTER ROOM - DAY'. The analysis created two final output files with the answer and supporting evidence. While this is based on plot description rather than the actual script text, the conclusion is well-reasoned using standard TV script formatting conventions and the detailed opening scene description. The **PLAN** objective has been essentially achieved - no further development needed unless the actual BBC script text becomes available for verification.",
