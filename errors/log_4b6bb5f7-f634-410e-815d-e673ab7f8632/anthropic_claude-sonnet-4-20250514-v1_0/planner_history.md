He flips a switch and collapses to the ground, his body fading away into dust, as the teleporter activates, materialising the Doctor inside its chamber."\n\n2. **Location Hierarchy Identified**:\n   - Primary Location: CONFESSION DIAL (the prison/trap device created by Time Lords)\n   - Secondary Location: CASTLE (the physical setting inside the Confession Dial)\n   - Specific Room: TELEPORTER ROOM (where the opening scene takes place)\n\n3. **Script Format Analysis**: Following standard TV script formatting conventions, interior scenes use "INT." followed by location hierarchy from general to specific.\n\n4. **Sources Analyzed**: Successfully retrieved and analyzed content from:\n   - Tardis Data Core Wiki (67,471 characters of detailed episode information)\n   - Planet Claire Doctor Who site (17,834 characters of episode content)\n   - Multiple location term frequency analyses\n   - Plot summaries and opening scene descriptions\n\n**Files Created**:\n- `workspace/scene_heading_final_analysis.json` - Comprehensive analysis with evidence\n- `workspace/heaven_sent_scene_heading_answer.txt` - Final answer document with supporting evidence\n- `workspace/heaven_sent_location_analysis.json` - Location hierarchy and alternative formats\n- Multiple source content files for reference\n\n**Confidence Level**: High - This conclusion is based on detailed official plot descriptions from Doctor Who wiki sources and standard television script formatting conventions.
