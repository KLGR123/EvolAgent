# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for the official script of Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11 to identify the exact location name as it appears in the first scene heading where the Doctor is trapped in the ever-shifting maze. Look for the episode title, official BBC scripts, production documents, or reliable sources that contain the actual script text with scene headings and location descriptions.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate the official script for Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11 to find the exact scene heading text, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific location name as it appears in the official script's first scene heading, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement for the exact setting name from the script rather than general episode descriptions

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 8: Locate and Transcribe Teal’c’s Response to “Isn’t That Hot?” in SG-1 YouTube Clip

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated quality assurance for call centers by transcribing customer support calls, locating when a customer says “cancel my subscription,” and extracting the agent’s exact response for compliance review
- Digital archiving of corporate training videos, searching for the phrase “safety hazard” in noisy plant footage and documenting the instructor’s follow-up instructions for audit trails
- Film post-production localization workflows that identify and time-stamp a character’s catchphrase (e.g., “bring me the code”) in raw footage and export the translated dialogue script for subtitling
- E-learning content indexing by detecting when an instructor asks “any questions?” in recorded lectures and automatically generating navigation bookmarks around the ensuing student Q&A segment
- Legal deposition analysis where court reporters transcribe lengthy audio, search for the question “do you recall?” and extract the deponent’s precise answer for exhibit preparation
- Manufacturing process monitoring that captures machine alarms (e.g., “overheat warning”) from workshop audio, transcribes the alert, and logs the technician’s acknowledgment response for incident tracking
- Wildlife research audio analysis in the field, identifying when a rare bird call (“tu-weet”) occurs in background recordings and extracting the surrounding researcher commentary for ecological studies
- Podcast production automation that scans recorded episodes for explicit sponsor cue phrases (e.g., “today’s episode is brought to you by”) and isolates the host’s tailored ad read for editing and insertion

### Development Step 6: Locate “Isn’t that hot?” exchange and transcribe Teal’c’s exact response from the YouTube video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Customer support call transcription and specific complaint keyword spotting for quality assurance in contact centers
- Lecture video transcription and student question‐answer extraction for e-learning platforms
- Surveillance audio analysis and suspicious phrase detection for security operations in law enforcement
- Focus group session transcription and sentiment keyword identification for product development teams
- Archival broadcast video indexing and catchphrase search for media libraries and content distributors
- Medical consultation recording transcription and symptom keyword extraction for electronic health record enhancement
- Podcast episode transcription and topic segment annotation for content creators and publishers
- Legal deposition video transcription and critical phrase highlighting for law firms and court reporting services

### Development Step 3: Find and Transcribe Teal’c’s Response to “Isn’t That Hot?” in YouTube Video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Fan-driven Stargate quote archive: automatically download key scenes from YouTube, extract Teal’c’s “Isn’t that hot?” response, transcribe the dialogue and timestamp for inclusion in a community-maintained quote database
- Linguistic analysis of fictional dialects: pull audio clips of Teal’c’s speech from YouTube, transcribe targeted question-and-answer exchanges, and analyze phonetic patterns for a research paper on constructed languages
- Streaming subtitle generation and localization: isolate the “Isn’t that hot?” segment, produce a precise transcript of Teal’c’s reply, and feed it into a translation workflow to create accurate subtitles in multiple languages
- AI chatbot persona training for Sci-Fi characters: collect authentic Teal’c responses by downloading and transcribing specific lines, then integrate them into a chatbot to emulate his speech style in interactive fan applications
- Compliance audit for clip licensing: extract and document exact dialogue segments from YouTube videos, log Teal’c’s reply verbatim, and attach metadata for legal review when securing broadcast rights
- Podcast episode highlight reel: automate the download, audio extraction, and transcription of fan-favorite Teal’c lines like his response to “Isn’t that hot?”, then assemble them into a curated nostalgia segment
- Quality assurance for automatic captioning services: use the known “Isn’t that hot?” exchange to verify the accuracy of speech-to-text algorithms by comparing the system’s output to the manually extracted transcript
- Educational media analysis in film studies: retrieve and transcribe Teal’c’s concise responses from selected YouTube scenes, enabling film students to examine character development through repeated dialogue patterns

### Development Step 11: Locate Greetham’s “Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)” (pp.45–46) and verify quoted passage.

**Description**: Search for the academic article 'Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)' by David Greetham published in Textual Cultures: Texts, Contexts, Interpretation, vol. 3 no. 1, 2008, pages 45-46. Use the provided DOI 10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44 to locate the article on Project MUSE or through DOI resolution. Extract the complete text from pages 45-46 to verify if the quoted passage 'obscured not by a "cloak of print" but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission' appears exactly as cited in the bibliography.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic journal editorial teams use automated DOI resolution and HTML scraping to verify author citations and ensure quoted passages match original publications during peer review quality control
- University librarians integrate DOI-based metadata extraction and quote verification scripts into repository workflows to confirm full-text availability and accurate catalog records for archival of electronic theses
- Legal analysts deploy automated quote extraction from jurisprudence articles via DOI resolution to cross-check citations and quotations in legal briefs, minimizing transcription errors and ensuring case law accuracy
- Investigative journalists employ DOI lookup and web scraping to authenticate scholarly sources cited in investigative reports, ensuring that quoted material is accurately represented and preventing misinformation
- Digital humanities researchers use automated page-level text extraction and context analysis to study variations in manuscript transmission and verify quoted passages across multiple editions and digital archives

### Development Step 9: Extract and Transcribe "Isn't That Hot?" Dialogue and Teal’c’s Reply from YouTube Video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal video evidence processing to transcribe courtroom footage and extract witness statements containing specific phrases for case preparation
- Customer support call QA automation by transcribing recorded service calls to identify “I’m not satisfied” or similar complaint triggers for supervisor review
- Market research on product demo videos to locate and compile user feedback comments like “this feature is great” for prioritizing development roadmaps
- Social media moderation by analyzing livestreams to detect and flag policy-violating language in real time for compliance teams
- Educational lecture indexing to transcribe university seminars, tag question-and-answer segments, and enable students to search for “Can you explain...” queries
- Media production highlight creation by extracting memorable soundbites from celebrity interviews (“That was awesome!”) for promotional reels
- Accessibility caption generation for online courses by transcribing instructor dialogue and identifying speaker changes for precise subtitle synchronization
- Linguistic research on archival broadcasts to automatically transcribe and analyze usage patterns of phrases such as “Do you really think...” across decades
