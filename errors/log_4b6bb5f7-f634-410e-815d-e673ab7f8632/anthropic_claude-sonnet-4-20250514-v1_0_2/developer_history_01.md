    "description": "Initial search phase for Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 ('Heaven Sent') script sources. This code systematically searches multiple potential sources including BBC official pages, Chakoteya transcript archive, TARDIS Wiki, and other Doctor Who script repositories. The approach focuses on finding the actual script text or detailed transcripts that would contain scene headings and location descriptions for the opening sequence where the Doctor is trapped in the ever-shifting maze. The code saves relevant content to workspace files for detailed analysis, specifically looking for scene headings that would contain the exact location name as it appears in the official script. This is the first step in a multi-phase approach to locate and extract the precise location name from the first scene heading of the episode.",

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed without errors and successfully collected 3 potentially relevant sources containing Heaven Sent content, saving them to workspace files totaling over 1MB of data. However, the primary objective from the **PLAN** was not achieved - no actual script text with scene headings was found or analyzed. The Chakoteya transcript archive (most likely to contain full scripts) failed due to SSL certificate issues, and BBC official sources returned 404 errors. The TARDIS Wiki file (562KB) shows the most promise with indicators including 'script', 'transcript', 'scene', 'confession dial', and 'castle'. **PLAN** alignment: 40% - data collection successful but location name not identified.

    "description": "Comprehensive analysis of the collected HTML files from the previous search to extract script content and identify the exact location name from the first scene heading of Heaven Sent. This code systematically parses each HTML file (prioritizing the 562KB TARDIS Wiki file), searches for script-style formatting patterns, scene headings, and location descriptions. It looks for specific patterns like 'INT./EXT.', bracketed stage directions, and location-time formats commonly used in TV scripts. The analysis focuses on finding opening sequence descriptions, castle/confession dial references, and maze-related content. Special attention is given to the TARDIS Wiki file with deep analysis of plot sections, infoboxes, and relevant headings. Results are saved to a comprehensive JSON analysis file for reference, with the goal of identifying the exact wording of the location name as it would appear in the official script's first scene heading.",

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed without errors and performed comprehensive analysis of the 3 collected HTML files, successfully identifying Heaven Sent content and extracting potential script elements. The analysis found 139 script-related elements, 10 potential scene descriptions, and 10 location matches across the sources. However, the primary objective from the **PLAN** was not achieved - no exact location name from the first scene heading was definitively identified. The most promising finding was 'Inside the Doctor's confession dial; the Doctor's mind palace' from the TARDIS Wiki, but this appears to be descriptive text rather than an official script scene heading. **PLAN** alignment: 60% - thorough analysis completed but specific location name still not found. The analysis results have been saved to 'workspace/heaven_sent_script_analysis.json' for reference. Next step: The current sources appear to contain plot summaries and fan content rather than official BBC scripts. May need to search for Steven Moffat's original screenplay, BBC production documents, or alternative official script repositories to find the exact scene heading format and location name as it appears in the actual shooting script.",

    "description": "Deep analysis of the TARDIS Wiki content to extract the exact location name from the first scene heading of Heaven Sent. This code performs a comprehensive examination of the HTML content, focusing on plot sections, opening scene descriptions, and confession dial interior details. It searches for specific patterns that might indicate script-like content or production notes, extracts potential location names using regex patterns, and looks for opening scene indicators like 'the episode begins' or 'doctor finds himself'. The analysis attempts to identify the precise wording that would appear in an official script scene heading, distinguishing between plot summaries and actual script formatting. Results are compiled into a detailed findings summary and saved to a JSON file for reference. While this approach maximizes extraction from available fan sources, it acknowledges that finding the exact BBC script scene heading format may require access to official production documents or Steven Moffat's original screenplay.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and performed an extremely thorough deep dive analysis of the TARDIS Wiki content, building on previous findings to extract more detailed information about Heaven Sent's opening scenes. The analysis successfully identified multiple potential location references including 'Inside the Doctor's confession dial', 'Castle (within confession dial)', and various castle/dial combinations. However, the **PLAN** objective remains unachieved - no exact scene heading from the official script was found. The analysis correctly concludes that the available sources contain plot summaries and fan content rather than Steven Moffat's original BBC shooting script with proper scene heading formatting. **PLAN** alignment: 75% - comprehensive analysis complete with valuable findings documented, but the specific official script scene heading format is not accessible through these sources. The detailed findings have been saved to 'workspace/heaven_sent_detailed_findings.json' for future reference. Final assessment: To find the EXACT scene heading as it appears in the official script, access to BBC production documents, Steven Moffat's original screenplay, or professional script archives would be required. The current analysis has exhausted the available fan and wiki sources.",

    "description": "Targeted search for Steven Moffat's official Heaven Sent script from BBC Writers' Room, following the lead discovered in the TARDIS Wiki analysis that mentioned 'Script release: online here' and referenced the BBC Writers Room website. This code systematically checks multiple BBC Writers' Room URLs, looks for PDF script downloads, and attempts to access the official screenplay that would contain the exact scene headings in proper BBC script format. The approach includes checking for direct PDF downloads, parsing HTML pages for script links, searching Internet Archive for cached versions, and trying specific URL patterns where BBC scripts might be hosted. If successful in finding the official script, it will extract and analyze the opening scene heading to identify the precise location name as it appears in Steven Moffat's original screenplay. This represents the most promising path to finding the exact script formatting rather than fan summaries or plot descriptions.",

    "feedback": "Execution incomplete - Code started successfully and began searching for the official BBC Writers' Room Heaven Sent script, which is the correct approach based on the **PLAN** objective. The code was attempting to access multiple BBC Writers' Room URLs including direct script download links, which shows good strategy for finding Steven Moffat's original script with exact scene headings. However, the execution was cut short after only checking the first BBC URL, showing a 404 error and creating a workspace directory. **PLAN** alignment: 20% - correct approach initiated but execution incomplete. The code was designed to check 5+ BBC URLs, search for PDF script downloads, analyze script content for scene headings, and save any found scripts to workspace files. Recommendation: Re-run the code to complete the full BBC Writers' Room search sequence, as this is the most direct path to finding the official script with the exact location name from the first scene heading where the Doctor is trapped in the maze.",

    "description": "Completing the comprehensive BBC Writers' Room search that was interrupted in the previous attempt. This code systematically checks all planned BBC URLs for Steven Moffat's official Heaven Sent script, including direct PDF downloads, HTML pages with script links, and alternative BBC sources. The approach handles both PDF and text-based scripts, immediately analyzes any text scripts found for scene headings, and specifically looks for the first scene heading that would contain the exact location name where the Doctor is trapped in the maze. If successful, it extracts and saves the first scene heading to a dedicated file, achieving the core objective of finding the precise location name as it appears in the official BBC script. The code also includes fallback searches through alternative BBC pages and provides comprehensive reporting of all files collected during the search process.",

    "feedback": "Execution incomplete - Code started successfully and began the systematic BBC Writers' Room search for Steven Moffat's official Heaven Sent script, which is exactly the right approach based on the **PLAN** objective. The code was designed to check 7 BBC URLs including direct PDF script downloads, search for official screenplay content, and extract exact scene headings. However, execution was cut short after checking only the first few URLs, with some returning 404 errors and others showing partial results. **PLAN** alignment: 30% - correct strategy initiated but search incomplete. The code found existing workspace files from previous searches and was properly configured to save any discovered official scripts for analysis. Next step: Complete the full BBC Writers' Room search sequence, as this systematic approach to finding Steven Moffat's original screenplay represents the best path to identifying the exact location name as it appears in the official first scene heading where the Doctor is trapped in the ever-shifting maze.",

    "description": "Comprehensive final search for Steven Moffat's Heaven Sent script to identify the exact location name from the first scene heading. This code first inspects existing analysis files to understand previous findings, then searches alternative script archives including Internet Archive, script databases, and Wayback Machine for archived BBC content. It systematically downloads and analyzes any found script content, looking specifically for scene headings with patterns like 'INT.', 'EXT.', 'CASTLE', 'CONFESSION DIAL', etc. If official script content is found, it immediately extracts and saves the first scene heading. If not found, it compiles the most likely answer based on episode analysis, standard BBC script formatting conventions, and the established setting (Doctor trapped in castle within confession dial). The approach provides both a definitive answer if the official script is located, or a well-researched conclusion based on available evidence about the episode's opening scene location.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed a comprehensive final search for the official Heaven Sent script, building on all previous analysis work. The code successfully inspected existing workspace files, searched multiple script archives and repositories, and attempted to access official BBC sources. However, the primary **PLAN** objective was not achieved - no official BBC script with exact scene headings was found. The search found that most official BBC Writers' Room links return 404 errors, suggesting the scripts are no longer publicly available. The code did successfully compile the most likely location name based on all available evidence: 'CONFESSION DIAL - CASTLE' as the probable first scene heading format. **PLAN** alignment: 85% - exhaustive search completed with comprehensive analysis saved to multiple workspace files (heaven_sent_location_analysis.txt, heaven_sent_script_analysis.json, etc.), but the exact official script scene heading remains inaccessible. The analysis concludes that finding the precise wording would require access to Steven Moffat's original shooting script, BBC production documents, or professional script archives that are not publicly available. The search has been thorough and the most probable answer has been documented based on standard BBC script formatting and episode content analysis.",
