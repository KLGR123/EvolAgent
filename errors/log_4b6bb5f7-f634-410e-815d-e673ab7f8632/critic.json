  "final_answer": "Cannot be determined from publicly available sources",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the exact location name as it appears in the first scene heading of the official BBC script for Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11 ('Heaven Sent'). This requires access to authentic production script materials with original scene heading formatting. Individual member evaluation: All three members conducted systematic and comprehensive searches using appropriate methodologies. Member 1 analyzed official sources and applied standard TV script formatting conventions, concluding 'CONFESSION DIAL - TELEPORTER ROOM' based on canonical plot descriptions. Member 2 performed exhaustive multi-phase searches across BBC archives, script repositories, and fan sources, determining 'INT. CONFESSION DIAL - CASTLE - DAY' as most probable. Member 3 conducted the most thorough investigation with 13+ analysis phases totaling 1.5MB of research data, ultimately concluding the objective cannot be completed due to inaccessibility of official scripts. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on core findings: (1) All members identified that official BBC scripts are not publicly available, (2) All confirmed the setting involves the Confession Dial castle environment, (3) All recognized the limitation that fan transcripts provide episode summaries rather than authentic script formatting. Divergence analysis: Members 1 and 2 attempted to provide probable answers using standard formatting conventions, while Member 3 maintained that without access to the actual script, the exact wording cannot be determined. Critical assessment: Member 3 demonstrated superior analytical rigor by acknowledging the fundamental limitation that the task requires access to proprietary BBC production materials that are not publicly accessible. While Members 1 and 2 provided educated estimates, Member 3 correctly identified that speculation about scene heading format, however well-reasoned, cannot fulfill the requirement for exact wording from the official script. Final determination: The task cannot be completed with available resources, as it requires access to authentic BBC production scripts that are not publicly available.",
