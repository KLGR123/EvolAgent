  "final_answer": "[Teleport chamber room]",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Find the exact setting name from the first scene heading of the official Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11 script where the Doctor is trapped in an ever-shifting maze. This requires locating authentic script sources and identifying precise scene heading terminology, not dialogue descriptions. Member evaluation: Member 1 claims the setting is 'Inside the Doctor's confession dial; the Doctor's mind palace' but provides no verification of actual script access or scene heading format - this appears to be a general episode description rather than a specific scene heading. Member 2 systematically located the official Chakoteya Archive script (a well-established and authoritative Doctor Who script repository), identified the specific line number (37), and extracted the exact scene heading '[Teleport chamber room]' in proper script formatting with square brackets. Member 3 found 'MECHANICAL MAZE' from dialogue content, not from a scene heading, which fails to meet the task requirement for scene heading terminology. Cross-analysis reveals significant divergence: Members 1 and 3 provide descriptive content while Member 2 provides actual scene heading format. Convergence assessment shows only Member 2 demonstrates authentic script access with verifiable source citation and proper formatting. Resolution analysis: The task specifically requests the setting 'exactly as it appears in the first scene heading' - only Member 2's answer follows standard script scene heading format with brackets and provides traceable source verification. Integration validation: Member 2's methodology is most rigorous with systematic source identification, official script download, line-by-line analysis, and proper scene heading extraction. Final verification confirms '[Teleport chamber room]' represents the precise first scene heading terminology from the official script where the Doctor materializes in the maze location.",
