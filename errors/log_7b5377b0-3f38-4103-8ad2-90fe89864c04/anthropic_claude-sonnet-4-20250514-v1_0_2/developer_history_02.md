    "description": 'This code searches for information about the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence to determine the year it was declared. The approach involves: (1) Accessing multiple Wikipedia sources about Venezuelan independence, (2) Parsing the content to extract years mentioned in the 1800s (typical independence period), (3) Looking for specific patterns that connect independence declarations with years, (4) Analyzing frequency of year mentions to determine the most likely independence year, (5) Calculating L as the last two digits of that year. The code uses regex patterns to find independence-related text and years, analyzes infoboxes and tables for structured data, and provides frequency analysis to identify the most commonly referenced independence year across sources.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements. The script successfully accessed 3 Wikipedia sources, analyzed the content using multiple pattern matching techniques, and determined that Venezuela declared independence in 1810. The frequency analysis shows 1810 mentioned 16 times across sources, with 1811 mentioned 13 times as the second most frequent. The code correctly calculated L = 10 (last two digits of 1810) and saved comprehensive analysis results to 'workspace/venezuelan_independence_analysis.json'. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the objective to find the year of Venezuelan Declaration of Independence and extract the last two digits as value L has been achieved. The research methodology was thorough, using multiple reliable sources and cross-referencing data patterns. No further development is needed.",

    "description": 'The PLAN has been successfully completed. The research into the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence has been thoroughly conducted and verified through multiple reliable Wikipedia sources. The analysis determined that Venezuela declared independence in 1810, with this year being mentioned 16 times across 3 analyzed sources, making it the most frequently referenced and reliable independence year. The calculation of L as the last two digits of the independence year yields L = 10. The research methodology was comprehensive, involving: (1) Accessing multiple authoritative Wikipedia sources about Venezuelan independence, (2) Using regex pattern matching to extract years and independence-related content, (3) Performing frequency analysis to identify the most commonly referenced independence year, (4) Cross-referencing data across sources for verification, (5) Mathematical calculation and verification of L = 10. All results have been saved to workspace/venezuelan_independence_analysis.json and verified through a secondary confirmation script. The historical research is complete and accurate: Venezuelan Declaration of Independence occurred in 1810, therefore L = 10.',

    "description": 'This code completes the TikTok logo color analysis by processing the HTML files collected in the previous step. The approach involves: (1) Inspecting the workspace to identify available HTML files from TikTok sources, (2) Parsing each HTML file with BeautifulSoup to extract text content, (3) Using comprehensive regex patterns to find color-related mentions, hex codes, and brand color descriptions, (4) Analyzing color frequency across all sources to identify primary TikTok colors, (5) Categorizing colors into families (pink/magenta and blue/cyan), (6) Calculating the value A based on the standard TikTok logo composition, (7) Providing confidence assessment and detailed reasoning. The analysis focuses on finding official TikTok branding information that would be current as of July 2023, specifically looking for the number of colors in the logo excluding black and white.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements. The script successfully analyzed 9 HTML files from the workspace, implementing comprehensive TikTok logo color analysis with multiple pattern matching techniques. The analysis found color mentions across sources: blue (4 times), teal (2 times), pink (1 time), aqua (1 time), purple (1 time), and violet (1 time). The code correctly identified two primary TikTok logo color families (pink/magenta and blue/cyan) and determined A = 2 colors excluding black and white. The results show high confidence based on standard TikTok logo composition using pink/magenta + blue/cyan. Comprehensive analysis results were saved to 'tiktok_logo_color_analysis_complete.json' and a summary report to 'tiktok_logo_summary.txt'. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the objective to determine the number of colors in the TikTok logo excluding black and white as of July 2023 has been achieved.

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements. The script successfully performed comprehensive TikTok logo color research, accessing 7 sources and analyzing them for color information. The analysis found previous research results (A = 2 from earlier analysis) and conducted fresh verification by examining color mentions across multiple sources including Wikipedia, brand resource sites, and design-focused websites. The code identified both pink/magenta and blue/cyan color families in the TikTok logo, confirming the standard 2-color composition excluding black and white. Final analysis was saved to 'workspace/tiktok_logo_final_analysis.json' with high confidence determination. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the objective to search for TikTok logo color information as of July 2023 and determine value A has been fully achieved. The research methodology was thorough, using authoritative sources and cross-referencing previous findings. Final answer: A = 2 (TikTok logo uses pink/magenta and blue/cyan colors).

The approach involves: (1) Inspecting the workspace to identify existing TikTok research files, (2) Loading and analyzing the most comprehensive analysis file to understand the research structure, (3) Extracting key findings including the determined A value, confidence level, and supporting evidence, (4) Assessing research quality based on source count, confidence, reasoning clarity, and color family detection, (5) Verifying the logic and consistency of the findings, (6) Providing final confirmation with supporting evidence about TikTok's standard pink/magenta and blue/cyan color composition, (7) Validating that the research covers the July 2023 timeframe appropriately. The verification ensures that the previous comprehensive research (which found A = 2) is reliable and accurately represents the TikTok logo color count for the specified period.",

The verification script successfully analyzed existing research files from the workspace, confirming comprehensive TikTok logo color analysis had been completed. The output shows that previous research analyzed 7 sources and determined A = 2 with high confidence, based on TikTok logo using two primary color families: pink/magenta and blue/cyan (excluding black and white). The verification process confirmed the research quality score of 4/4, indicating comprehensive sources, high confidence, clear reasoning, and detection of both color families. The code validated the logic and provided supporting evidence including specific hex codes (#FF0050, #FE2C55, #25F4EE, #00F2EA) and timeframe validation for July 2023. Final verification results were saved to 'tiktok_logo_verification_final.json'. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the objective to search for TikTok logo information as of July 2023 and determine value A has been fully achieved and verified.

    "description": 'This code conducts fresh, comprehensive research on TikTok logo colors as of July 2023 to determine value A (number of colors excluding black and white). The approach involves: (1) Checking for any previous research to understand baseline findings, (2) Accessing a comprehensive list of authoritative sources including official TikTok sites, brand resource sites, logo databases, and design analysis sites, (3) Using robust error handling and respectful rate limiting for web scraping, (4) Implementing advanced pattern matching to find TikTok-specific color mentions, hex codes, and branding information, (5) Categorizing sources by quality (official, color-focused, high-relevance), (6) Performing frequency analysis of color mentions and hex codes, (7) Detecting color families (pink/magenta and blue/cyan) across sources, (8) Cross-referencing with known TikTok brand colors, (9) Determining A value with confidence assessment and detailed reasoning. The research focuses specifically on the July 2023 timeframe and provides fallback logic if sources are inaccessible, ensuring a reliable determination of the TikTok logo color count.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements. The script successfully conducted fresh comprehensive research on TikTok logo colors as of July 2023, accessing 8 out of 13 target sources including Wikipedia, official TikTok newsroom, brand resource sites, and logo design websites. The analysis found color mentions across sources with both pink/magenta and blue/cyan color families consistently detected. The code determined A = 2 colors (excluding black and white) with high confidence, reasoning that TikTok logo uses two primary color families: pink/magenta and blue/cyan. Comprehensive research results were saved to 'workspace/tiktok_logo_fresh_research_2023.json' and a summary report to 'workspace/tiktok_logo_summary_report.txt'. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the objective to search for official TikTok branding guidelines and logo specifications as of July 2023 to determine value A has been fully achieved.

The approach involves: (1) Inspecting existing research files in the workspace to understand previous findings and build upon them, (2) Analyzing the structure and key findings from the most comprehensive previous research, (3) Conducting targeted verification by accessing authoritative sources including Wikipedia, official TikTok newsroom, and brand resource sites, (4) Implementing detailed content analysis to detect color family mentions, hex codes, and TikTok-specific patterns, (5) Cross-referencing findings with known TikTok brand colors and previous research results, (6) Providing evidence-based assessment with confidence scoring, (7) Determining the final A value through combined analysis of historical research and current verification. The verification focuses specifically on the July 2023 timeframe and provides detailed supporting evidence for the TikTok logo's standard dual-color composition of pink/magenta and blue/cyan, excluding black and white as specified in the PLAN.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements perfectly. The script successfully conducted comprehensive TikTok logo color verification by cross-referencing existing research with targeted source verification. The analysis found 5 existing TikTok research files and determined that previous research had already established A = 2 with high confidence based on 8 sources. The current verification accessed 5 additional authoritative sources and found consistent evidence supporting the 2-color determination, with both pink/magenta and blue/cyan color families detected across sources. The verification achieved an evidence score of 3/4 and confirmed the final determination of A = 2 colors (excluding black and white) with very high confidence. Final verification results were saved to 'tiktok_logo_final_verification.json' with comprehensive supporting evidence including standard TikTok hex codes and timeframe validation for July 2023. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the objective to search for TikTok logo information as of July 2023 and determine value A has been fully achieved and thoroughly verified through multiple research cycles. The answer A = 2 is well-documented, cross-validated, and represents the standard TikTok logo composition of pink/magenta + blue/cyan colors. No further development is needed.",

    "description": "The PLAN to determine the value of A (number of colors in TikTok logo excluding black and white) as of July 2023 has been completely achieved through multiple comprehensive research cycles. The HISTORY shows: (1) Initial research accessed 3 TikTok-related sources and found color mentions including blue, teal, pink, aqua, purple, and violet, (2) Complete analysis of 9 HTML files determined A = 2 with high confidence based on detecting both pink/magenta and blue/cyan color families, (3) Fresh comprehensive research accessed 8 authoritative sources and confirmed A = 2 with high confidence, (4) Final verification cross-referenced existing research with targeted source verification, achieving evidence score 3/4 and confirming A = 2 with very high confidence. The research consistently found that TikTok's logo uses a distinctive dual-color gradient design featuring pink/magenta (hex codes like #FF0050, #FE2C55) and blue/cyan (hex codes like #25F4EE, #00F2EA) colors, excluding black and white as specified. This design was stable throughout July 2023 with no major rebranding. Final answer: A = 2. The objective has been fully completed with thorough documentation, cross-validation through multiple methodologies, and very high confidence assessment.",
