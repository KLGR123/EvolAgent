# Developer Plan 04

## Plan
Solve the equation Lx = (d/dx * (A * x²)) + 4097 - C for x to the nearest tenth using the determined values: L = 10, A = 2, and C = 151. First calculate the derivative d/dx * (A * x²) = d/dx * (2x²) = 4x, then substitute all values into the equation 10x = 4x + 4097 - 151, simplify to find x, and round the result to the nearest tenth.

## Description
This is the final step because: (1) We have successfully determined all three required variables from the previous research: L = 10 (last two digits of Venezuelan independence year 1810), A = 2 (colors in TikTok logo excluding black and white as of July 2023), and C = 151 (height of average Philippine woman in centimeters), (2) The equation can now be fully solved by taking the derivative and substituting the known values, (3) Expected outcome is the final value of x rounded to the nearest tenth, (4) This completes the TASK by providing the definitive mathematical solution to the given equation.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Newton's Method to Four-Decimal Convergence for f(x)=x³+4x²−3x+8 from x₀=−5

**Description**: Implement Newton's Method for the function f(x) = x³ + 4x² - 3x + 8 starting with x₀ = -5. Calculate the derivative f'(x) = 3x² + 8x - 3 and apply the iterative formula xₙ₊₁ = xₙ - f(xₙ)/f'(xₙ). Continue iterations until finding the smallest n where xₙ = xₙ₊₁ when both values are rounded to four decimal places. Track each iteration's values and identify when convergence occurs at the specified precision level.

**Use Cases**:
- Aerospace control system calibration for determining the equilibrium pitch angle by finding the real root of a cubic lift‐force polynomial
- Chemical reactor steady‐state analysis to solve the cubic rate equation for reactant concentration convergence during process optimization
- Analog circuit design validation for locating the operating point in transistor models governed by a cubic current‐voltage characteristic
- Structural engineering beam deflection assessment by computing the root of a cubic bending equation to ensure safety compliance under load
- Robotics inverse kinematics refinement to find actuator joint angles from a cubic displacement equation for precise end‐effector positioning
- Pharmaceutical dissolution modeling to determine the concentration root in a cubic solubility equation for formulating controlled‐release tablets
- Financial model calibration to solve the cubic polynomial arising in yield curve fitting and achieve convergence at target precision
- Computer graphics ray‐surface intersection computation for cubic Bézier patches to accurately render complex curved surfaces

### Development Step 1: Newton’s Method for x³+4x²−3x+8: Iterations to Four-Decimal Convergence

**Description**: Implement Newton's Method for the function f(x) = x³ + 4x² - 3x + 8 starting with x₀ = -5. Calculate the derivative f'(x) = 3x² + 8x - 3 and apply the iterative formula xₙ₊₁ = xₙ - f(xₙ)/f'(xₙ). Continue iterations until finding the smallest n where xₙ = xₙ₊₁ when both values are rounded to four decimal places. Track each iteration's values and identify when convergence occurs at the specified precision level.

**Use Cases**:
- Mechanical engineering beam deflection analysis by solving the cubic equilibrium equation f(x)=x³+4x²−3x+8=0 with Newton’s Method to predict critical load points
- Chemical process optimization for phase equilibrium using a simplified Van der Waals cubic equation f(x)=x³+4x²−3x+8=0 and Newton’s Method to determine molar volume at given temperature and pressure
- Financial modeling of an internal rate of return (IRR) where the NPV function is approximated as f(r)=r³+4r²−3r+8 and Newton’s Method is applied to find the discount rate that zeroes NPV
- Control systems stability analysis by solving the characteristic polynomial f(s)=s³+4s²−3s+8=0 using Newton’s Method to locate closed-loop poles and ensure system damping requirements
- Computer graphics curve-line intersection calculation for a cubic Bezier curve defined by f(t)=t³+4t²−3t+8 and Newton’s Method to compute precise parameter values at intersection points
- Robotics inverse kinematics for a three-link manipulator where the joint-angle equation simplifies to f(θ)=θ³+4θ²−3θ+8=0, using Newton’s Method to converge on the correct actuator angle
- Electrical circuit transient analysis by finding the natural response roots of an RLC network’s cubic characteristic f(i)=i³+4i²−3i+8=0 with Newton’s Method for accurate time-domain predictions
- Environmental modeling of contaminant dispersion where the concentration balance yields f(x)=x³+4x²−3x+8=0, and Newton’s Method is used to solve for equilibrium pollutant levels in soil or water

### Development Step 3: Newton’s Method for f(x)=x³+4x²−3x+8 from x₀=−5 to Four-Decimal Convergence

**Description**: Implement Newton's Method for the function f(x) = x³ + 4x² - 3x + 8 starting with x₀ = -5. Calculate the derivative f'(x) = 3x² + 8x - 3 and apply the iterative formula xₙ₊₁ = xₙ - f(xₙ)/f'(xₙ). Continue iterations until finding the smallest n where xₙ = xₙ₊₁ when both values are rounded to four decimal places. Track each iteration's values and identify when convergence occurs at the specified precision level.

**Use Cases**:
- Calibrating a non-linear sensor response in aerospace instrumentation by finding the root of its cubic output polynomial, while logging each Newton iteration for quality assurance and traceability
- Determining the break-even point in a manufacturing cost-revenue model represented by a cubic equation, with detailed iteration tracking to support accurate financial forecasting

- Computing load-deflection roots in mechanical beam analysis using Newton’s Method, integrating the process into structural design software and archiving results for engineering audits
- Locating the market equilibrium price in an economic supply-demand cubic model, with automated convergence verification and result reporting for macroeconomic policy simulations
- Implementing a real-time root-finding module in robotics control to solve cubic motion-planning equations, including iteration logs for debugging and safety certification
- Demonstrating numerical methods in a university course by applying Newton’s Method to a cubic function, providing students with full iteration outputs and convergence analysis
- Performing stability analysis in power system engineering by finding roots of the system’s characteristic cubic polynomial, with automated logging and file-based reporting for validation and compliance

### Development Step 1: 4x4 Boggle Solver with words_alpha Dictionary to Find Longest Valid Word

**Description**: Download the words_alpha dictionary from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words to workspace/words_alpha.txt and then implement a Boggle solver to find all valid words that can be formed from the given 4x4 board (ABRL/EITE/IONS/FPEI) using the downloaded dictionary. The solver should check all possible paths on the board where adjacent cells (including diagonally adjacent) can be visited exactly once per word, then identify the longest valid English word(s) and return the alphabetically first one if there are ties.

**Use Cases**:
- ESL vocabulary assessment tool for educators: generate custom 4×4 boards aligned to lesson vocab lists, automatically solve them to create answer keys and track student progress
- Word-game app development and difficulty calibration: integrate the solver to validate player inputs in real time, ensure boards yield a target number of valid words, and dynamically adjust board complexity
- Linguistic pattern research and statistical analysis: analyze thousands of random Boggle boards to study word-length distribution, letter adjacency effects, and frequency of rare words in large English corpora
- Puzzle quality assurance in game design: automatically test proposed board layouts to verify minimum and maximum possible word lengths, ensuring puzzles are solvable and meet design criteria
- Competitive Boggle training and performance analytics: enable tournament players to upload board snapshots, receive full solution lists with scoring insights, and identify high-value word paths to refine strategy
- Assistive technology for visually impaired gamers: integrate the solver with voice-based interfaces to read out possible word paths and word lists, making Boggle accessible via screen readers
- Marketing and branding brainstorming: agencies input sets of campaign-specific letters to discover valid, memorable words and acronyms for product naming and slogan generation
- AI algorithm benchmarking and complexity testing: use Boggle solving as a standardized search and language-comprehension challenge to compare path-finding optimizations and dictionary lookup strategies
