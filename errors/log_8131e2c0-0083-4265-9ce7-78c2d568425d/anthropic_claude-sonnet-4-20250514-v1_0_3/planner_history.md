# Planner History

## Execution History
```
{
    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": "Search for information about James testing the 'Cheater' and 'Cheater Beater' devices in season 4 of his channel, focusing on finding the CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) performance measurements for both devices. Look for YouTube videos, channel content, or other sources that document these specific tests and extract the CFM values reported for each device during season 4 testing.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify which 'James' and which channel is being referenced, likely related to tool testing or performance evaluation content, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this topic, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the specific season 4 episode or content where both the Cheater and Cheater Beater CFM measurements were reported, (4) This directly targets finding the specific CFM performance data requested in the TASK",
