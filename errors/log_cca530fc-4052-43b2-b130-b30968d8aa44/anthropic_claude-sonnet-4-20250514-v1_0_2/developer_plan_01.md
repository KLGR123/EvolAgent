# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Analyze the chess position from the attached image data/gaia/2023/validation/cca530fc-4052-43b2-b130-b30968d8aa44.png to identify the current board state, piece positions, and determine the winning move for black. Extract the position details including all piece locations, evaluate tactical opportunities such as checkmate patterns, forks, pins, or other forcing moves that guarantee a win for black, then provide the correct move in algebraic notation.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the exact chess position from the image before determining the winning move, (2) No previous analysis of the chess position has been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete board state analysis and identify the tactical pattern that leads to a guaranteed win for black, (4) This directly addresses the TASK by analyzing the position to find the correct next move in algebraic notation

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 15: Report START’s Two-Cell Neighbors’ Text and Hex Fill Colors to Verify Legal Moves.

**Description**: Inspect workspace/grid_data.json entries for the four cardinal two-cell neighbor coordinates of the START cell by locating the coordinates (start_x±2, start_y) and (start_x, start_y±2) based on the recorded START position in workspace/start_end_coordinates.json; report each neighbor’s displayed text and 6-digit hex fill color to verify which moves from START are actually legal.

**Use Cases**:
- Board game development and move validation for a digital chess variant
- Robotic warehouse navigation and obstacle detection for automated fulfillment systems
- GIS land parcel adjacency analysis and zoning compliance in urban planning
- Automated UI testing and layout verification for grid-based dashboard components
- Medical imaging grid spot analysis and color-coded lesion detection in histopathology software
- Cellular automata neighbor rule evaluation for computational physics and biology research
- PCB component placement verification in manufacturing process quality control
- Educational puzzle app development and dynamic hint generation for grid-based math learning platforms

### Development Step 12: Find 11th-move cell and its hex color via BFS on legal two-cell move graph

**Description**: Construct adjacency graph of legal two-cell moves using workspace/grid_data.json and workspace/start_end_coordinates.json and perform a breadth-first search from the START cell to locate the shortest path to the END cell enforcing no immediate backtracking; identify the coordinate of the cell landed on after the 11th move along the resulting path; extract that cell’s 6-digit hex fill color from workspace/grid_data.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Warehouse AGV route optimization and floor‐marker color verification for industrial logistics
- Autonomous indoor drone waypoint planning and floor‐marker localization for smart warehousing
- Tile-based game level path validation and timed event trigger placement for puzzle video games
- PCB assembly head movement planning and solder-mask inspection at specific placement steps for electronics manufacturing
- Greenhouse robot navigation and soil-moisture sensor sampling after fixed moves for precision agriculture
- Educational STEM tool for knight-move puzzle solving with stepwise feedback in classroom learning
- Digital pathology slide scanning path planning and stain-color sampling at a critical step for medical research analysis

**Use Cases**:
- Warehouse AGV route optimization with color-coded floor zoning: map the storage hall grid, compute legal two-tile hops avoiding restricted blue areas, and retrieve the floor zone color at the 11th stop to adjust forklift speed and load handling.
- Checkers-style board game AI development: represent the game board as a grid of pieces and empty tiles, enforce legal two-cell jumps without backtracking, then identify the 11th landing square’s color to influence strategic evaluation or UI highlight.
- Agricultural drone flight planning over orchards: load a grid of crop sectors with no-fly blue areas, perform two-meter jumps requiring safe mid-air clearance, and extract the 11th sector’s soil-moisture color code to trigger targeted watering.
- Museum guide robot path scheduling: model exhibit spaces as a grid, avoid blue restricted zones, find the shortest no-backtracking tour path, and determine the 11th exhibit’s floor-panel color to synchronize audio narration.
- Data center maintenance robot routing: map server rack aisles on a grid, skip over blocked areas using two-rack jumps, and read the thermal-zone hex color at the 11th rack location to prioritize cooling interventions.
- Geological field survey navigation: convert a rock strata map into a passable grid, execute two-cell leaps across stable layers, and identify the 11th cell’s mineral-composition color to plan targeted coring.
- Hospital cleaning automation: treat wards as a grid with contamination zones marked blue, compute efficient two-room cleaning hops without backtracking, and retrieve the 11th room’s hazard-level color code to deploy specialized disinfectants.
- Smart irrigation network troubleshooting: abstract valve locations as a grid, perform two-pipe jumps where intermediate valves are functional, then extract the 11th valve’s flow-status color to adjust downstream pressure.

### Development Step 13: Extract 11th Move Cell’s Hex Color via BFS on Two-Cell Adjacency Graph

**Description**: Construct adjacency graph of legal two-cell moves using workspace/grid_data.json and workspace/start_end_coordinates.json and perform a breadth-first search from the START cell to locate the shortest path to the END cell enforcing no immediate backtracking; identify the coordinate of the cell landed on after the 11th move along the resulting path; extract that cell’s 6-digit hex fill color from workspace/grid_data.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Autonomous warehouse robotics: compute the shortest aisle-to-aisle route for an AGV avoiding blocked passages and read the floor tile’s hex color at the 11th move to verify drop-zone alignment
- Emergency response routing in smart cities: plan the optimal ambulance path through a block-grid, bypassing road closures, and identify the pavement-type color code at the 11th intersection for dynamic detour decisions
- Tile-based video game AI: find the minimal-step path for an NPC through a level map with impassable tiles and trigger a special event by detecting the 11th-step tile’s fill color
- PCB layout verification in electronics manufacturing: trace the shortest conductor route between two pads on a grid of vias, skip disconnected segments, and sample the solder mask’s hex color at the 11th via for quality control
- Precision agriculture drone planning: map a collision-free flight path over a field grid avoiding no-fly zones and extract the NDVI-derived hex color at the 11th waypoint to assess crop health
- Facility security patrol scheduling: generate the shortest guard patrol route through a building floor grid while avoiding restricted areas and check the alarm panel’s color-coded status at the 11th checkpoint
- Archaeological excavation grid analysis: chart a nonredundant trench path across site squares, ensure connectivity, and pull the soil-type hex color at the 11th grid cell for targeted sampling
