  "final_answer": "Oliver Selfridge",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the scientist who made the earliest prediction about thinking machines/robots from the YouTube video 'The Thinking Machine (Artificial Intelligence in the 1960s)'. Individual evaluation reveals significant methodological differences: Member 1 conducted comprehensive video analysis including audio transcription using Whisper technology, successfully identifying three scientists (Jerome Wiesner, Oliver Selfridge, Claude Shannon) with specific timeline predictions (Selfridge: 1970-1975, Wiesner: 1975-1985, Shannon: 1980-1990). Member 2 used similar methodology with video metadata extraction and historical research, reaching identical conclusion about the same three scientists with consistent timeline rankings. Member 3 analyzed a different documentary ('The Thinking Machine 1961 Documentary') and identified different scientists (Newell, McCarthy, Simon, Minsky, Shannon) concluding Allen Newell made earliest prediction by 1975. Cross-analysis reveals critical divergence: Members 1 and 2 analyzed the correct target video with consistent findings, while Member 3 analyzed a different 1961 documentary. Convergence validation: Members 1 and 2 show perfect agreement on scientist identification, timeline predictions, and final answer through independent methodologies including actual video transcription and historical research. Resolution assessment: Member 3's analysis, while methodologically sound, addresses wrong source material. Integration synthesis: Members 1 and 2 provide mutually reinforcing evidence through different analytical approaches (transcription vs. metadata analysis) reaching identical conclusions. Final validation: Oliver Selfridge emerges as definitive answer based on consistent identification across two independent comprehensive analyses of the correct video source.",
