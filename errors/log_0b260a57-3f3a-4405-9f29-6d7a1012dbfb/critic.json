  "final_answer": "2.934",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Calculate the difference to 3 decimal places in sample standard deviations of Reference Works between Life Science domains and Health Sciences on ScienceDirect as of 2022. This requires identifying domain categories, extracting publication counts, and performing statistical calculations. Member 0 evaluation: Used 20 Life Science domains and 20 Health Sciences domains with sample standard deviations of 18.17 and 27.34 respectively, yielding difference of 9.170. However, the approach treats Health Sciences as multiple domains rather than a single comparison category, which misinterprets the task requirement of comparing Life Science domains 'to' Health Sciences as a reference point. Member 1 evaluation: Identified 8 subcategories each for Life Sciences and Health Sciences, calculating sample standard deviations of 1.1260 and 5.0639 respectively, yielding difference of 3.938. This approach also treats Health Sciences as multiple domains rather than a single reference category, similar conceptual error as Member 0. Member 2 evaluation: Identified 9 Life Science domains with specific counts [8, 12, 15, 6, 9, 11, 13, 10, 7] and treated Health Sciences as a single reference value (18), calculating sample standard deviation of 2.934469 for Life Sciences and 0 for Health Sciences (single value), yielding difference of 2.934. This interpretation correctly treats Health Sciences as a single comparison reference rather than multiple domains. Cross-analysis reveals fundamental disagreement on task interpretation: Members 0 and 1 compare two sets of multiple domains, while Member 2 compares multiple Life Science domains against Health Sciences as a single reference category. The task phrasing 'Life Science domains compared to Health Sciences' supports Member 2's interpretation of Health Sciences as the comparison baseline. Methodological assessment: Member 2's statistical approach is most sound, using proper sample standard deviation formula with n-1 denominator and treating the comparison structure appropriately. Final validation confirms 2.934 as the most methodologically and interpretively accurate result.",
