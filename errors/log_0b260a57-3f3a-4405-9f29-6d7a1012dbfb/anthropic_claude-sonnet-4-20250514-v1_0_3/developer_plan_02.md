# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Calculate the sample standard deviations for the Life Science domains Reference Works data and Health Sciences, then determine the difference to 3 decimal places. Using the extracted data from the previous research: Life Science domains (Agricultural Sciences: 8, Biochemistry: 12, Biology: 15, Biophysics: 6, Botany: 9, Ecology: 11, Genetics: 13, Immunology: 10, Neuroscience: 7) and Health Sciences: 18, compute the sample standard deviation for the 9 Life Science domains and compare it to Health Sciences (treating it as a single value with standard deviation of 0). Calculate the absolute difference between these two standard deviations and express the result to exactly 3 decimal places.

## Description
This is the necessary final step because: (1) The developer successfully extracted comprehensive Reference Works data for all 10 domains from ScienceDirect for 2022, providing the complete numerical dataset needed for statistical analysis, (2) We have the specific counts for 9 Life Science domains (ranging from 6 to 15 Reference Works) and Health Sciences (18 Reference Works), (3) Expected outcome is to compute the sample standard deviations using the standard statistical formula and determine their difference to 3 decimal places, (4) This completes the TASK by providing the precise statistical comparison requested between Life Science domains and Health Sciences Reference Works publications

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 14: Estimating False Positive Papers in Nature’s 2020 Publications Using a 4% Type-I Error Rate

**Description**: Calculate the number of statistically incorrect papers using the false positive rate principle. Given that Nature published 1,002 research articles in 2020, all assumed to rely on statistical significance with an average p-value of 0.04, determine how many would be incorrectly claiming statistical significance. Apply the concept that a p-value of 0.04 means there's a 4% chance of a false positive (Type I error) when the null hypothesis is true. Calculate 1,002 × 0.04 and round up to the next integer as specified in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic journal editorial board uses the calculation to estimate how many cancer-biology papers published in 2020 may be falsely claiming novel biomarkers, guiding more rigorous peer‐review standards
- Pharmaceutical R&D risk assessment team applies the false-positive rate principle to their preclinical efficacy studies to predict the number of drug candidates likely to fail in Phase II trials due to statistical flukes
- Regulatory agency (e.g., FDA) implements the solution to audit submitted clinical trial reports and estimate how many efficacy claims could be Type I errors before approving new therapies
- Grant review panels at a national science foundation use the calculation on past proposal outcomes to gauge the prevalence of spurious pilot‐study results informing funding decisions
- Meta-analysis researchers in cognitive psychology apply the method across hundreds of published studies to quantify the expected proportion of false positives influencing overall effect‐size estimates
- Science journalists at a major media outlet leverage the approach to flag press releases from high-impact journals that might overstate findings due to Type I errors, streamlining fact-checking workflows
- University research integrity office employs the calculation to monitor departmental publication quality, identifying fields with unusually high false-positive rates for targeted statistical training

### Development Step 7: Extract and alphabetize chemicals with EC numbers 1.11.1.7;3.1.3.1 from 2016 Wiley virus study

**Description**: Access the identified 2016 Wiley paper 'Effects of Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus and Sweet Potato Chlorotic Stunt Virus' and extract the specific chemicals with EC numbers 1.11.1.7 and 3.1.3.1 used in the virus testing methods. Identify the chemical names corresponding to these EC numbers, alphabetize them, and format the EC numbers in the required semicolon-separated order.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated retrieval and analysis of plant pathology protocols to extract and alphabetize enzyme reagents (EC 1.11.1.7 and 3.1.3.1) for virus assay standardization in research labs
- Pharmaceutical R&D informatics workflow that scans Wiley publications to compile lists of oxidative and phosphatase enzymes used across antiviral studies
- Regulatory compliance automation for biotech firms to verify documented enzyme usage in published methods against internal chemical safety databases
- Academic library metadata enrichment process that tags and catalogs enzyme EC numbers from newly added plant virology papers for improved searchability
- Bioinformatics database curation pipeline to harvest and annotate enzyme information (EC 1.11.1.7, 3.1.3.1) from peer-reviewed articles for public enzyme repositories
- Chemical supplier catalog update system that identifies demand for alkaline peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase by extracting EC-number references from recent scientific literature
- Journal editorial office quality assurance tool that checks submitted manuscripts for completeness of enzyme reagent details by automatically detecting EC numbers in methods sections

### Development Step 1: Total number of Nature journal’s peer-reviewed research articles published in 2020

**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Use Cases**:
- University research office compiling annual publication metrics for performance review and grant reporting
- Academic librarians analyzing Nature’s 2020 research output to negotiate subscription licenses and budget allocations
- Meta-analysis researchers quantifying publication trends in high-impact journals for bibliometric studies
- Science journalists aggregating peer-reviewed article counts for end-of-year coverage on Nature’s scientific impact
- Data scientists integrating Nature 2020 research article statistics into institutional dashboards for strategic planning
- Grant administrators verifying peer-reviewed publication counts to support funding proposals and renewal dossiers
- Library consortia benchmarking Nature’s research output against competing journals to inform collection development decisions
