Look for specific statistics showing a decline from 37% to 24% (a 13% change) and the timeframe over which this change occurred. Focus on finding authoritative Girls Who Code sources that document this gender representation trend in the computer science field.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate Girls Who Code's specific data about women's representation in computer science, particularly the historical trend showing a 13% decline from 37%, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find Girls Who Code's official documentation or advocacy materials containing the statistical timeline of women's participation in computer science, (4) This directly targets the organization mentioned in the TASK and will provide the authoritative source needed to determine the timeframe for this demographic change",

    "description": "This final analysis extracts and presents the complete findings from the successful Girls Who Code search. The PLAN has been fully achieved - we found the authoritative Girls Who Code source documenting the exact decline from 37% to 24% women in computer science, with the specific timeframe (1995 to present). The key finding is the official Girls Who Code statement: 'In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. Today, it's only 24%.' This provides all required elements: (1) Official Girls Who Code source from their about-us page, (2) Historical data showing 37% representation in 1995, (3) Current data showing 24% representation today, (4) Clear documentation of the 13 percentage point decline, (5) Timeframe spanning approximately 29 years. The analysis also captures additional context about the worsening gender gap and Girls Who Code's mission to address it. All documentation has been saved to workspace files for future reference. The PLAN objective is 100% complete with authoritative source material.",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted by the developer, Girls Who Code's official website (about-us page) contains the specific statistical data requested. The key finding is Girls Who Code's statement: 'In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. Today, it's only 24%.' This shows a 13 percentage point decline (37% - 24% = 13%) that occurred over approximately 29 years, from 1995 to present day (2024). Final answer: According to Girls Who Code, it took approximately 29 years for the percentage of computer scientists that were women to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%.",
