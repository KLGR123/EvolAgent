Look for their official website, annual reports, or advocacy materials that document these historical trends.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate Girls Who Code's specific data about women in computer science percentages and the timeframe for the 13% decline from 37%, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the organization's official documentation or reports containing the historical statistics about women computer scientists, (4) This directly targets the specific data needed to determine how many years it took for this demographic change to occur",

    "description": '**PLAN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED** - The search for Girls Who Code\'s historical statistics about women in computer science has been fully accomplished. \n\n**KEY FINDINGS EXTRACTED:**\n\n**Primary Statistic Found:**\n- **Source:** Girls Who Code official about-us page (https://girlswhocode.com/about-us/)\n- **Exact Quote:** "In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. Today, it\'s only 24%."\n- **Decline:** 13 percentage point decrease (37% to 24%)\n- **Timeframe:** 1995 to present day (approximately 29 years)\n\n**Additional Timeline Data Discovered:**\n- **1995:** 37% women in computer science\n- **2017:** 24% women in computer science  \n- **2022:** 22% women in computer science\n- **Trend:** Continuing decline over nearly three decades\n\n**Context Information:**\n- Girls Who Code identifies this as "the gender gap in computing is getting worse"\n- They note "the biggest drop off of girls in computer science is between the ages of 13 and 17"\n- Organization states "The percent will continue to decline if we do nothing"\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `girls_who_code_search_results.json` - Comprehensive search analysis\n- `gwc_about_us_detailed_analysis.json` - Detailed extraction of statistics\n- `gwc_annual_reports_analysis.json` - Annual reports analysis\n- Multiple HTML files from Girls Who Code website for reference\n- Annual report HTML files (2022-2024) with PDF download links available\n\n**Verification:** The statistics were found multiple times in different contexts on the official Girls Who Code website, confirming authenticity. The organization uses this data as a core part of their mission statement and advocacy materials.\n\n**PLAN Status:** 100% Complete - All required information (37% to 24% decline statistics and historical timeframe) has been successfully located and documented from official Girls Who Code sources.',

    "plan": 'Calculate the exact timeframe for the 13% decline in women computer scientists based on the Girls Who Code data. The research found that in 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women, and by 2017 it had declined to 24% (a 13 percentage point decrease). Determine the number of years between 1995 and 2017 to provide the final answer.',
    "description": 'This calculation step is needed because: (1) The developer successfully found the key Girls Who Code statistics showing 37% women in computer science in 1995 declining to 24% by 2017, which represents exactly the 13% change specified in the TASK, (2) We have the start year (1995) and end year (2017) from the official Girls Who Code data, (3) Expected outcome is a simple calculation: 2017 - 1995 = 22 years, (4) This provides the definitive answer to how long it took for the percentage to change by 13% from the starting point of 37%',
