### Identify weight and adjacent-column swap causing checksum errors in modified ISBN-13 numbers

**TASK**: The following numbers function similarly to ISBN 13 numbers, however, their validation methods are slightly different. Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

### Title: Find Longest Word on Boggle Board ABRL EITE IONS FPEI Using words_alpha Dictionary

**TASK**: I thought we could try a fun word puzzle together :)

I've got a Boggle board here:

ABRL
EITE
IONS
FPEI

I'd like to know the longest word that can be generated from the board. Please find the longest English language word that can be generated from this board. If more than one word of the same length exists at the maximum word length, please report the longest word that comes first, alphabetically. Oh, and I know that there might be different wordlists available for Boggle, so let's please just use the words_alpha dictionary found at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words as the dictionary for our game.
