  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine the count of High Energy Physics - Lattice articles from January 2020 on arXiv that had PostScript (.ps) versions available. This requires accurate identification of the paper dataset and format availability analysis. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted systematic arXiv search claiming 88 hep-lat papers from January 2020 with 0 PostScript versions, citing arXiv's transition away from PostScript by 2020. Member 2 performed exhaustive search using 5 methodologies and 27 API calls, definitively establishing that the hep-lat category contains only ~2,200 papers from 1992-1996 with NO papers from 2020, making the answer 0 by absence of papers entirely. Member 3 claimed to find 97 hep-lat papers from January 2020 with 95 having PostScript versions (97.9% availability rate). Cross-analysis reveals fundamental contradiction: Members 1 and 3 claim to find papers from January 2020 (88 and 97 respectively) while Member 2 establishes through comprehensive methodology that no hep-lat papers exist from 2020. Divergence resolution: Member 2's approach demonstrates superior methodological rigor with exhaustive validation across multiple search strategies, explicit acknowledgment of the hep-lat category's historical scope (1992-1996), and technical validation through successful identification of recent papers in other categories. Members 1 and 3 appear to have fundamental errors in their dataset identification. Synthesis evaluation: Member 2's finding that hep-lat category ended in 1996 is most credible given the comprehensive verification methodology. Final validation: The absence of papers makes PostScript availability analysis impossible, yielding definitive answer of 0.",
