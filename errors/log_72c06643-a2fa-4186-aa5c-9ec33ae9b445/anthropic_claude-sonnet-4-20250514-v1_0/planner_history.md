    "description": 'The Freon-12 thermodynamic properties research has been completed successfully and comprehensively. All **PLAN** objectives have been fully achieved: (1) Critical properties research - Successfully identified critical temperature (385.12 K), critical pressure (4.136 MPa), and critical density (558.0 kg/m³), (2) Equation of state parameters - Calculated Peng-Robinson EOS parameters (a=1.133381 Pa·m⁶·mol⁻², b=0.00006023 m³/mol) and compiled acentric factor (0.176) and critical compressibility factor (0.278), (3) Thermodynamic behavior data - Comprehensive compilation of molecular weight (120.91 g/mol), normal boiling point (-29.75°C), triple point properties, and recommended EOS methods, (4) Extreme P-T condition capability - All necessary data for specific volume/density calculations under high pressure and temperature conditions is now available through the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The research generated 4 comprehensive data files totaling 31,713 bytes: freon12_comprehensive_properties.json (1,977 bytes), freon12_equation_of_state_parameters.json (930 bytes), nist_freon12_data.txt (11,744 bytes), and freon12_search_results.json (17,062 bytes).
