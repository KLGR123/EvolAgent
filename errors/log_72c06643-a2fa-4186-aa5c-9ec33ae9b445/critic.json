  "reason": "Task analysis: Calculate the volume of 0.312 kg Freon-12 refrigerant at the bottom of the Marianas Trench under peak temperature conditions, requiring precision to the nearest milliliter. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted the most rigorous analysis with proper identification of critical properties (Tc=385.12K, Pc=4.136MPa, ω=0.176) and correct environmental conditions (110.3 MPa pressure, 274.15K temperature representing the actual deep ocean temperature). Applied Peng-Robinson equation of state yielding Z=3.347672, density=1747.82 kg/m³, and final volume of 179 mL. Member 2 used similar thermodynamic approach but with slightly different critical values and environmental conditions (1,100 bar, 275.15K), reaching 174 mL through comparable methodology. Member 3 made a critical error by using 400°C hydrothermal vent temperature instead of the ambient deep ocean temperature, resulting in 251 mL - this represents a fundamental misinterpretation of 'peak temperature' in the context of the trench environment. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on methodology and environmental conditions, with only minor differences in property values. The key divergence is Member 3's temperature selection. Integration assessment: The 'peak temperature' at the Marianas Trench bottom refers to the ambient deep ocean temperature (~1-2°C), not localized hydrothermal vent temperatures which would not represent the stabilized conditions for the refrigerant system. Member 1's approach demonstrates superior environmental condition interpretation and most precise thermodynamic property compilation. Final validation confirms 179 mL as the most accurate result based on correct environmental parameters and rigorous equation of state application.",
