### Identify weight and adjacent-column swap causing checksum errors in modified ISBN-13 numbers

**TASK**: The following numbers function similarly to ISBN 13 numbers, however, their validation methods are slightly different. Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

    "plan": "Calculate the time required for Eliud Kipchoge to run the Earth-Moon minimum perigee distance using his marathon world record pace. Use Kipchoge's pace of 20.90 km/h from the previous analysis and the minimum perigee distance of 356,400 km from the Moon's Wikipedia page. Convert the result to thousand hours and round to the nearest 1000 hours as specified in the TASK.",
    "description": "This is the final calculation step because: (1) We have both required components - Kipchoge's world record pace (20.90 km/h) and the minimum perigee distance (356,400 km), (2) Previous steps successfully gathered the marathon pace and Moon distance data, (3) Expected outcome is the final answer showing how many thousand hours it would take, rounded to the nearest 1000 hours without comma separators, (4) This completes the TASK by performing the distance/speed calculation and applying the specified formatting requirements.",

    "description": 'The calculation has been completed successfully and verified by the tester. The task required calculating the time for Eliud Kipchoge to run the Earth-Moon minimum perigee distance using his marathon world record pace of 20.90 km/h and the minimum perigee distance of 356,400 km, then converting to thousand hours and rounding to the nearest 1000 hours. The calculation was performed correctly: 356,400 km ÷ 20.90 km/h = 17,052.63 hours, which rounds to 17,000 hours, or 17 thousand hours. The tester confirmed 100% alignment with the PLAN requirements and noted that no further development is needed. The final answer of 17 thousand hours is correct and complete.',
