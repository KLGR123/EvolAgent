This code: (1) Loads and encodes the PNG image file, (2) Sends a targeted prompt to GPT-4o requesting identification of the green polygon and extraction of purple-colored numerical measurements, (3) Processes the API response to get detailed polygon description and side length measurements, (4) Saves the complete analysis to workspace/polygon_analysis.txt for further processing. The analysis will help determine the polygon type, count the sides, and extract all numerical measurements needed for area calculation.
