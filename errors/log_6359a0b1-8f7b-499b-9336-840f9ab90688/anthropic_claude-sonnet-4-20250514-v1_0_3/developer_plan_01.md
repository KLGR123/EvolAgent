# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/6359a0b1-8f7b-499b-9336-840f9ab90688.png to identify the green polygon and extract the purple numerical values that represent side lengths. Determine the shape type (triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, etc.) and geometric properties of the green polygon, then calculate its area using the provided side length measurements.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to examine the image to understand the green polygon's shape and identify all purple numerical side length labels, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this geometric problem, (3) Expected outcome is to have the polygon vertices, side lengths, and shape classification identified for area calculation, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK by extracting the necessary geometric data from the visual representation

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Identify and Visualize Earl Smith’s Green Land Plot Cells in Excel Layout

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel spreadsheet file data/gaia/2023/validation/5cfb274c-0207-4aa7-9575-6ac0bd95d9b2.xlsx to identify all green cells representing Earl Smith's land plots. Extract the cell positions, colors, and create a visual representation of the spreadsheet layout to understand the spatial distribution of Earl's plots relative to other landowners' plots.

**Use Cases**:
- Real estate portfolio mapping and visual distribution analysis for commercial property management firms
- Municipal zoning extraction and GIS integration for urban planning departments
- Agricultural subsidy eligibility scanning and field plot mapping for government farm agencies
- Habitat conservation data parsing and protected area mapping for environmental NGOs
- Utility service area identification and maintenance scheduling for energy infrastructure operators
- Construction site allocation parsing and resource coordination for general contractor firms
- Insurance risk plot identification and premium calculation optimization for underwriting teams
- Community land tenure extraction and documentation mapping for international development NGOs

### Development Step 1: Visualizing Earl Smith’s Green Cells in Land Plot Excel Spreadsheet

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel spreadsheet file data/gaia/2023/validation/5cfb274c-0207-4aa7-9575-6ac0bd95d9b2.xlsx to identify all green cells representing Earl Smith's land plots. Extract the cell positions, colors, and create a visual representation of the spreadsheet layout to understand the spatial distribution of Earl's plots relative to other landowners' plots.

**Use Cases**:
- Government cadastral mapping and land registry automation by extracting color‐coded ownership plots to update digital map databases
- Real estate due diligence workflows that visualize Excel‐highlighted property parcels owned by specific investors for investment analysis
- Agricultural field management systems identifying green‐coded crop plots per farmer to optimize resource allocation and yield forecasting
- Environmental impact assessments locating green‐highlighted conservation areas within survey spreadsheets to integrate with GIS for habitat protection
- Urban planning and zoning compliance checks extracting color‐designated residential, commercial, and industrial parcels from city planning documents
- Insurance underwriting risk profiling by mapping green-shaded floodplain or landslide-prone zones in survey workbooks for policy pricing
- Infrastructure project land acquisition tracking by compiling Excel‐flagged stakeholder parcels into visual layouts for negotiation and planning
- Legal boundary dispute resolution supporting attorneys in extracting lawyer‐marked colored cells representing contested lot lines to prepare court exhibits

### Development Step 1: Parse File Road Layout, Locate Houses, Mile Markers, Define Coordinates, Compute House-Tower Distances

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached file data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt to understand the road layout, identify all house positions, and map their locations relative to mile markers. Extract the visual representation showing dashes (-) as mile markers and H symbols as houses, then determine the coordinate system and calculate distances between houses and potential tower locations.

**Use Cases**:
- Rural broadband deployment planning: parse the ASCII road layout to extract house locations by mile marker, then calculate optimal fiber cable routes to bring high-speed internet to each home.
- Emergency medical services optimization: analyze the distances between mapped house positions and candidate ambulance station sites to determine the fastest response coverage along a remote highway.
- Postal delivery route automation: ingest the text-based road map to pinpoint rural mailbox locations, then compute the shortest delivery loop for mail carriers using mile-marker coordinates.
- Electric grid maintenance scheduling: map household positions relative to power line inspection crews’ depots to sequence pipeline or line checks by proximity and minimize downtime.
- Mobile network coverage analysis: identify service gaps by measuring distances from village houses to existing cell towers and recommend new tower installations to fill black spots.
- Environmental sensor network design: use the extracted house coordinates along farmland roads to position weather or soil-moisture sensors at optimal intervals for agricultural research.
- Real estate site evaluation: chart the distribution of roadside properties via mile markers to spotlight high-density clusters for targeted development and marketing campaigns.

### Development Step 2: Parse Road Map to Identify Houses by Mile Markers and Compute Distances to Towers

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached file data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt to understand the road layout, identify all house positions, and map their locations relative to mile markers. Extract the visual representation showing dashes (-) as mile markers and H symbols as houses, then determine the coordinate system and calculate distances between houses and potential tower locations.

**Use Cases**:
- Telecom network planners determining optimal cell tower placements along rural highways to minimize average signal distance to homes clustered above and below the road
- Emergency services designing ambulance station or firehouse locations based on household positions along major roadways to reduce response times
- Broadband internet providers mapping potential distribution hub sites along a trunk route to ensure equitable coverage for properties on both sides of the highway
- Utility companies scheduling meter-reading and maintenance by calculating distances from main gas or water pipelines to residential units distributed along a linear corridor
- School transportation coordinators optimizing bus stop placements by analyzing student home mile‐marker positions relative to the bus route
- Real estate developers evaluating proximity of new housing parcels to proposed infrastructure expansions (roads, power lines) for investment decision support
- Environmental planners modeling roadside noise-barrier or greenbelt placement by assessing residential distance metrics from the highway
- Logistics and courier services planning drop‐off zones along delivery routes to minimize total travel and idle time when servicing homes on either side of the roadway

### Development Step 6: Python Script Analysis: String Array Operations from Image File data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png

**Description**: Extract and analyze the Python script from the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png to understand what operations it performs on string arrays.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated reconstruction of obfuscated URLs from archived web data for digital forensics investigations
- Dynamic generation of access links for protected resources in enterprise document management systems
- Extraction and reordering of encoded identifiers in bioinformatics pipelines for genome sequence analysis
- Restoration of original file paths from scrambled logs in cybersecurity incident response
- Custom URL creation for marketing campaigns where tracking codes are embedded via character reordering
- Decoding and validation of license keys or activation codes in software distribution workflows
- Reverse engineering of string-based puzzles or CAPTCHAs in automated testing environments
- Generating anonymized user profile links by permuting string identifiers in privacy-focused web applications
