    "description": "Starting comprehensive research of Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website to locate federal rules sections. This initial phase accesses the main federal rules page, analyzes the HTML structure, and identifies potential federal rules categories through multiple approaches: (1) Examining navigation menus and lists for rules-related links, (2) Analyzing main content areas for structured lists of federal rules, (3) Using text pattern matching to identify rules categories, (4) Saving all findings to workspace for further analysis. The code includes robust error handling and alternative approaches if the direct rules URL is not accessible. All discovered links and categories will be documented for alphabetical sorting in the next step.",

    "feedback": 'Execution failed - SyntaxError at line 143 due to improper string escaping in an f-string. The code attempted to escape single quotes within an f-string using backslashes, which is not valid Python syntax. The error occurred in the print statement: `print(f\'  {j}. {item_text[:100]}{\\\'...\\\' if len(item_text) > 100 else \\\'\\\'}\')` where the escaped quotes `\\\'` inside the f-string caused the syntax error. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no execution completed due to syntax issue. Recommended fix: Replace the problematic f-string with either double quotes for the outer string or use proper f-string syntax like `print(f\'  {j}. {item_text[:100]}{"..." if len(item_text) > 100 else ',

This comprehensive approach: (1) Accesses the main federal rules page and parses HTML structure, (2) Searches for federal rules categories using multiple CSS selectors and content analysis methods, (3) Identifies known federal rules sections like Civil Procedure, Criminal Procedure, Evidence, Appellate Procedure, and Bankruptcy Procedure, (4) Performs alphabetical sorting of found sections to determine the fifth position, (5) Saves all findings and results to workspace files for further analysis. The code includes robust error handling and alternative approaches if direct access fails, ensuring comprehensive data collection for identifying the target federal rules section.",

The script accessed Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website, extracted all federal rules sections, and correctly identified the fifth section alphabetically. The code found 6 total federal rules categories: Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Federal Rules of Evidence, and U.S. Supreme Court Rules. After alphabetical sorting, it correctly determined that 'Federal Rules of Evidence' is the fifth section alphabetically. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all objectives achieved including website navigation, federal rules identification, alphabetical ordering, and target section identification.
