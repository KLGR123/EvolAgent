Identify all available federal rules categories and determine which is the fifth section alphabetically. Extract the complete list of federal rules sections to establish the alphabetical ordering and identify the target section for further analysis.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the baseline by finding Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute and mapping out all federal rules sections, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the complete list of federal rules categories and determine which one ranks fifth alphabetically, (4) This establishes the foundation for the multi-step process of finding the specific rule, article with most 'witnesses' titles, and the deleted word in the last amendment",

Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure\n   2. Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure\n   3. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n   4. Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n   5. Federal Rules of Evidence\n\n4. **Fifth Section Identified**: **Federal Rules of Evidence** is the fifth federal rules section alphabetically.\n\n**Files Created in Workspace:**\n- `cornell_law_rules_page.html`: Raw HTML content from the Cornell Law rules page\n- `cornell_law_comprehensive_findings.json`: Complete analysis data including all discovered rules links and categories\n- `fifth_federal_rules_section.json`: Final result with alphabetical ordering and identification of the fifth section\n\n**Verification**: The tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with successful execution and correct identification of 'Federal Rules of Evidence' as the target section.\n\nThe research objective has been fully accomplished with comprehensive documentation and verified results.",

Then systematically search through all Federal Rules of Evidence articles to identify which article contains the word 'witnesses' in the most titles as of 2021. Once identified, examine the amendment history of Rule 1 within that specific article to determine what word was deleted in the most recent amendment.",
    "description": "This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified that Federal Rules of Evidence is the fifth federal rules section alphabetically, (2) Now we need to locate Rule 1 within the Federal Rules of Evidence and find the article with the most 'witnesses' references in titles, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific article containing Rule 1 that has the highest frequency of 'witnesses' in titles, and then analyze its amendment history to find the deleted word, (4) This directly progresses toward the final objective of identifying the word deleted in the last amendment to Rule 1 in the target article",

L. 93–595)\n   - Multiple amendment dates: 1987, 1988, 1993, 2000, 2011\n   - Amendment notes indicate mostly technical changes\n\n5. **Deleted Words Search Result**: After thorough analysis using multiple regex patterns and comprehensive text inspection, **no specific deleted words were found** in Rule 101\'s amendment history. The available amendment notes indicate "technical" changes with "no substantive change intended" rather than word deletions.\n\n**ANSWER TO PLAN QUESTION**: "What word was deleted in the most recent amendment to Rule 1?"\n→ **No deleted words were identified** in Rule 101\'s most recent amendments based on the comprehensive analysis of the Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute text.
