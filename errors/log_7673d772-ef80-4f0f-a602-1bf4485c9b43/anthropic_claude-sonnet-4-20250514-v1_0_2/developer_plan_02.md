# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Access the Federal Rules of Evidence section on Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website and analyze all the rules to find Rule 1 (the first rule). Then systematically search through all Federal Rules of Evidence articles to identify which article contains the word 'witnesses' in the most titles as of 2021. Once identified, examine the amendment history of Rule 1 within that specific article to determine what word was deleted in the most recent amendment.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified that Federal Rules of Evidence is the fifth federal rules section alphabetically, (2) Now we need to locate Rule 1 within the Federal Rules of Evidence and find the article with the most 'witnesses' references in titles, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific article containing Rule 1 that has the highest frequency of 'witnesses' in titles, and then analyze its amendment history to find the deleted word, (4) This directly progresses toward the final objective of identifying the word deleted in the last amendment to Rule 1 in the target article

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 4: Identify Witnesses in 1933 Dillinger Fake-Credentials Jailbreak, Sheriff‚Äôs Death, and Pierpont-Bridgewater Convictions

**Description**: Search specifically for information about the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger that resulted in the death of a sheriff and led to Harry Pierpont's conviction. Focus on identifying who provided testimony in this case and cross-reference with any testimony that also helped convict other gang leaders from the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang. Search for keywords including '1933 jailbreak John Dillinger fake credentials', 'Harry Pierpont sheriff death conviction', 'Lima Ohio jail break 1933', 'Dillinger escape plan testimony', and 'witness testimony Pierpont conviction'.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal case preparation for defense attorneys researching witness testimony and trial records from the 1933 Dillinger jailbreak to identify procedural errors or new exculpatory evidence.
- Academic criminal history analysis for a university professor compiling and categorizing primary sources on Harry Pierpont‚Äôs conviction and related gang trials for a peer-reviewed journal article.
- True-crime journalism deep dive to automate aggregation of newspaper archives, court transcripts, and eyewitness accounts around the Lima, Ohio jailbreak and sheriff‚Äôs death for an investigative series.
- Museum exhibit content curation to source and verify authentic trial documents, testimonies, and photos for an interactive Prohibition-era crime display on John Dillinger and his associates.
- Genealogy and family-history research for descendants tracing ancestral connections to the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang through court records and witness lists from 1933.
- Digital archiving and preservation for a historical society automating the discovery and categorization of scanned legal filings, trial transcripts, and newspaper clippings relating to the sheriff‚Äôs shooting.
- Law-enforcement training module development to build detailed case studies on investigative techniques, fake credentials methods, and witness testimony cross-referencing used in the Pierpont trial for modern detective academies.

### Development Step 3: Identify 2022 Legume Wikipedia content violations and the meaning of ‚ÄúR‚Äù in core policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate compliance auditing for an internal knowledge base: automatically parse HTML edit histories to identify content removals before December 2022, map them against three core documentation policies, and report what ‚ÄúR‚Äù stands for in each policy.
- Academic media studies research on Wikipedia edit behavior: extract 2022 pre-December policy violations and analyze how often core policies (including the ‚ÄúR‚Äù for Reliability) are cited in public logs.
- Newsroom fact-checking workflow: monitor high-traffic Wikipedia pages‚Äô edit history HTML to flag potential vandalism or copyright removals in 2022 and correlate them with the three core policies‚Äô ‚ÄúR‚Äù references.
- Open-source project documentation QA: scan project wiki talk pages‚Äô HTML to detect spam, deletion requests, or policy breaches before December 2022 and verify adherence to the trio of core guidelines, especially the ‚ÄúR‚Äù criterion.
- Legal discovery and e-discovery support: process archived HTML logs from Wikipedia to extract instances of content disputes in 2022, identify the violated policy types, and determine the meaning of ‚ÄúR‚Äù in each policy context.
- Government transparency dashboard: analyze municipal information pages‚Äô edit histories to track policy enforcement actions taken before December 2022 and highlight the role of ‚ÄúR‚Äù (Reliability) in official content standards.
- Nonprofit misinformation monitoring: parse HTML of selected topic pages‚Äô talk and history files to uncover 2022 content violations, categorize them under the three core policies, and detail how ‚ÄúR‚Äù shapes the reliable sourcing rule.
- Enterprise knowledge management automation: integrate a parser for wiki-style HTML logs to continuously detect policy violations (including ‚ÄúR‚Äù-related reliability issues) in user-generated content during 2022‚Äôs first eleven months.

### Development Step 1: Analyzing Legume Wikipedia 2022 Content Violations and Defining ‚ÄúR‚Äù in Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic research on editorial behavior: automating the extraction and analysis of 2022 edit logs from subject-specific Wikipedia pages (like ‚ÄúLegume‚Äù) to study how often and why contributors trigger content-policy violations.
- Corporate brand protection: monitoring a company‚Äôs Wikipedia entries for unauthorized changes, copyright infringements, or defamatory edits in public logs so legal teams can respond quickly.
- Data journalism investigation: scraping talk pages and edit histories to uncover patterns of biased content or hidden conflicts of interest, then visualizing when each policy breach occurred in 2022.
- Compliance auditing for NGOs: auditing Wikipedia‚Äôs public logs for policy violations (e.g., copyright, vandalism) to ensure reference materials used in grant proposals adhere to verifiable sourcing standards.
- Community moderation automation: building a bot that detects new edit history entries with policy indicators (reverts, deletions) in real time and flags them for human review, reducing response times on high-traffic articles.
- Educational digital literacy tool: creating a classroom application that tracks actual content disputes on Wikipedia, highlights three core policies (including what ‚ÄúR‚Äù stands for), and teaches students how to evaluate source reliability.
- Legal evidence collection: compiling timestamped records of reverted or deleted edits from 2022 public logs to support defamation or intellectual property cases with documented policy violations.

### Development Step 9: Identify Legume Wikipedia 2022 Content Violations and ‚ÄòR‚Äô Definition in Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Wikipedia editorial oversight: scanning the Legume article‚Äôs public edit logs to detect instances of biased language (NPOV breaches), unverifiable claims (V), and original research (NOR) in edits made throughout 2022 before December, and producing policy-compliance reports.
- Corporate technical documentation audit: analyzing the revision history of an internal engineering wiki to flag unverified design claims and undocumented research insertions, ensuring all technical content meets the company's reliability standards akin to Reliable Sources.
- Social media content policy enforcement: processing comment and post logs on an online community forum to automatically identify and categorize policy infractions‚Äîsuch as defamation, hate speech, or false statements‚Äîmapping them to core policy codes (e.g., V for Verifiability, NOR for No Original Research) for the moderation team.
- Academic research integrity checks: reviewing student thesis draft revisions on a university‚Äôs digital submission portal to uncover any uncited original research (NOR violations) and confirm all assertions are supported by reliable, peer-reviewed sources (RS).
- Newswire fact-checking automation: ingesting document change logs from a news agency‚Äôs content management system to isolate and report additions lacking credible references or containing editorial bias, tagging violations under corresponding core policies and alerting editors in real time.
- E-commerce product description validation: examining change logs in a marketplace platform where sellers update product information, detecting unverifiable claims (V) or overhyped, unsupported details, and enforcing a neutral, research-backed standard before listing goes live.
- Government policy document review: parsing the version history of municipal policy drafts on an open-data portal to identify any introduction of original analysis or shifts in neutral language (NPOV, NOR violations), and summarizing findings for legal compliance and public transparency teams.
