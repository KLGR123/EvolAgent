# Developer Plan 03

## Plan
Examine the amendment history of Rule 101 more thoroughly by accessing the original source documents, legislative records, or detailed amendment notes that might contain specific information about word deletions. Search for historical versions of Rule 101 from different time periods (particularly around the 1987, 1988, 1993, 2000, and 2011 amendment dates) to perform a direct text comparison and identify any words that were removed. Also investigate whether there are alternative sources or databases that provide more detailed amendment tracking for Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 101.

## Description
This additional analysis is necessary because: (1) The previous comprehensive search of Rule 101's amendment history on Cornell Law's website found technical changes but no specific deleted words, (2) The amendment notes mentioned multiple years (1987-2011) but may not contain the granular detail needed to identify specific word deletions, (3) Expected outcome is to access historical versions or more detailed amendment records that would show exact text changes including deletions, (4) This ensures we have exhausted all available sources before concluding that no word deletions occurred in Rule 101's amendments

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 8: Locate 1851 atheistic naturalism book on phrenology & mesmerism reissued by publisher in 2009

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify a co-authored book from 1851 that advocated for atheistic naturalism, systematically explored phrenology and mesmerism, was controversial for these topics, and was reissued by a publisher in 2009. Search using keywords including '1851 book atheistic naturalism phrenology mesmerism co-authored', '1851 controversial book phrenology mesmerism reissued 2009', 'atheistic naturalism 1851 publication', and 'phrenology mesmerism 1851 authors'. Focus on identifying both the original 1851 publication details and the specific publisher who reissued it in 2009.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historian cataloging 19th-century controversial publications by extracting author names, thematic keywords (e.g., “atheistic naturalism,” “phrenology”), and original/reissue dates from archived HTML search results to build a digital bibliography.
- Legal e-discovery team automating the analysis of thousands of saved HTML case summaries to identify specific statutes, publication years, and co-counsel mentions for evidence tracking in litigation.
- Publishing house digital archivist processing legacy website snapshots to pinpoint out-of-print titles, detect reissue editions (e.g., 2009 reprints), and extract publisher credits for planning new annotated volumes.
- Marketing intelligence unit scanning archived competitor webpages to count occurrences of key product terms, track first-release dates, and infer promotional patterns for strategic positioning.
- SEO consultant auditing historical site snapshots to extract keyword density, publication timestamps, and backlink publisher clues from saved HTML to optimize on-page content and refresh outdated pages.
- Compliance officer reviewing stored HTML policy documents to locate regulatory terms, confirm enactment years, and identify issuing bodies for audit readiness and gap analysis.
- Genealogy researcher mining downloaded obituary and local history pages to extract names, vital dates, and relationship mentions for automated family-tree construction.

### Development Step 3: Identify 2022 Legume Wikipedia content violations and the meaning of “R” in core policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate compliance auditing for an internal knowledge base: automatically parse HTML edit histories to identify content removals before December 2022, map them against three core documentation policies, and report what “R” stands for in each policy.
- Academic media studies research on Wikipedia edit behavior: extract 2022 pre-December policy violations and analyze how often core policies (including the “R” for Reliability) are cited in public logs.
- Newsroom fact-checking workflow: monitor high-traffic Wikipedia pages’ edit history HTML to flag potential vandalism or copyright removals in 2022 and correlate them with the three core policies’ “R” references.
- Open-source project documentation QA: scan project wiki talk pages’ HTML to detect spam, deletion requests, or policy breaches before December 2022 and verify adherence to the trio of core guidelines, especially the “R” criterion.
- Legal discovery and e-discovery support: process archived HTML logs from Wikipedia to extract instances of content disputes in 2022, identify the violated policy types, and determine the meaning of “R” in each policy context.
- Government transparency dashboard: analyze municipal information pages’ edit histories to track policy enforcement actions taken before December 2022 and highlight the role of “R” (Reliability) in official content standards.
- Nonprofit misinformation monitoring: parse HTML of selected topic pages’ talk and history files to uncover 2022 content violations, categorize them under the three core policies, and detail how “R” shapes the reliable sourcing rule.
- Enterprise knowledge management automation: integrate a parser for wiki-style HTML logs to continuously detect policy violations (including “R”-related reliability issues) in user-generated content during 2022’s first eleven months.

### Development Step 9: Identify Legume Wikipedia 2022 Content Violations and ‘R’ Definition in Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Wikipedia editorial oversight: scanning the Legume article’s public edit logs to detect instances of biased language (NPOV breaches), unverifiable claims (V), and original research (NOR) in edits made throughout 2022 before December, and producing policy-compliance reports.
- Corporate technical documentation audit: analyzing the revision history of an internal engineering wiki to flag unverified design claims and undocumented research insertions, ensuring all technical content meets the company's reliability standards akin to Reliable Sources.
- Social media content policy enforcement: processing comment and post logs on an online community forum to automatically identify and categorize policy infractions—such as defamation, hate speech, or false statements—mapping them to core policy codes (e.g., V for Verifiability, NOR for No Original Research) for the moderation team.
- Academic research integrity checks: reviewing student thesis draft revisions on a university’s digital submission portal to uncover any uncited original research (NOR violations) and confirm all assertions are supported by reliable, peer-reviewed sources (RS).
- Newswire fact-checking automation: ingesting document change logs from a news agency’s content management system to isolate and report additions lacking credible references or containing editorial bias, tagging violations under corresponding core policies and alerting editors in real time.
- E-commerce product description validation: examining change logs in a marketplace platform where sellers update product information, detecting unverifiable claims (V) or overhyped, unsupported details, and enforcing a neutral, research-backed standard before listing goes live.
- Government policy document review: parsing the version history of municipal policy drafts on an open-data portal to identify any introduction of original analysis or shifts in neutral language (NPOV, NOR violations), and summarizing findings for legal compliance and public transparency teams.

### Development Step 9: 17th-Century Chronicles Documenting Irish Spectral Army and Supernatural Phenomena

**Description**: Search for historical documents from the 17th century that record both a spectral army apparition in Ireland and unusual supernatural events. Focus on identifying chronicles, historical accounts, or antiquarian records from that period that document both phenomena. Look for works by historians, chroniclers, or antiquarians who recorded supernatural occurrences across Britain and Ireland during the 1600s, as this dual documentation will help identify the specific source that M.R. James likely used for his Suffolk spider curse inspiration.

**Use Cases**:
- Litigation support: scanning a repository of downloaded court judgment HTML files to score document relevance by legal terms and extract key precedent citations for paralegal teams
- Academic systematic review: parsing a local archive of scientific journal HTML articles to detect methodological keywords, compute relevance scores, and extract study summaries for meta-analysis in evidence-based medicine
- Brand reputation monitoring: analyzing archived marketing campaign landing page HTMLs to identify brand mentions, sentiment-laden phrases, and high-impact slogans for digital marketing optimization
- Regulatory compliance auditing: batch-processing corporate policy and regulatory guidance HTML documents to locate and extract passages on GDPR and financial reporting requirements for compliance officers
- Cybersecurity vulnerability assessment: examining saved web application HTML source pages to detect outdated JavaScript library references and known exploit signatures for security engineering teams
- Historical newspaper research: processing digitized 19th-century newspaper HTML editions to identify articles on industrial accidents and labor movements, assigning relevance scores for archivists and historians
- E-commerce competitive intelligence: extracting price, specification, and stock availability data from downloaded competitor product page HTML files to automate price monitoring and inventory forecasting

### Development Step 1: Analyzing Legume Wikipedia 2022 Content Violations and Defining “R” in Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic research on editorial behavior: automating the extraction and analysis of 2022 edit logs from subject-specific Wikipedia pages (like “Legume”) to study how often and why contributors trigger content-policy violations.
- Corporate brand protection: monitoring a company’s Wikipedia entries for unauthorized changes, copyright infringements, or defamatory edits in public logs so legal teams can respond quickly.
- Data journalism investigation: scraping talk pages and edit histories to uncover patterns of biased content or hidden conflicts of interest, then visualizing when each policy breach occurred in 2022.
- Compliance auditing for NGOs: auditing Wikipedia’s public logs for policy violations (e.g., copyright, vandalism) to ensure reference materials used in grant proposals adhere to verifiable sourcing standards.
- Community moderation automation: building a bot that detects new edit history entries with policy indicators (reverts, deletions) in real time and flags them for human review, reducing response times on high-traffic articles.
- Educational digital literacy tool: creating a classroom application that tracks actual content disputes on Wikipedia, highlights three core policies (including what “R” stands for), and teaches students how to evaluate source reliability.
- Legal evidence collection: compiling timestamped records of reverted or deleted edits from 2022 public logs to support defamation or intellectual property cases with documented policy violations.
