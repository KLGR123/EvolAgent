    "description": "Starting comprehensive research of Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website to locate federal rules sections. This initial phase accesses the main federal rules page, analyzes the HTML structure, and identifies potential federal rules categories through multiple approaches: (1) Examining navigation menus and lists for rules-related links, (2) Analyzing main content areas for structured lists of federal rules, (3) Using text pattern matching to identify rules categories, (4) Saving all findings to workspace for further analysis. The code includes robust error handling and alternative approaches if the direct rules URL is not accessible. All discovered links and categories will be documented for alphabetical sorting in the next step.",

    "feedback": 'Execution failed - SyntaxError at line 143 due to improper string escaping in an f-string. The code attempted to escape single quotes within an f-string using backslashes, which is not valid Python syntax. The error occurred in the print statement: `print(f\'  {j}. {item_text[:100]}{\\\'...\\\' if len(item_text) > 100 else \\\'\\\'}\')` where the escaped quotes `\\\'` inside the f-string caused the syntax error. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no execution completed due to syntax issue. Recommended fix: Replace the problematic f-string with either double quotes for the outer string or use proper f-string syntax like `print(f\'  {j}. {item_text[:100]}{"..." if len(item_text) > 100 else ',

This comprehensive approach: (1) Accesses the main federal rules page and parses HTML structure, (2) Searches for federal rules categories using multiple CSS selectors and content analysis methods, (3) Identifies known federal rules sections like Civil Procedure, Criminal Procedure, Evidence, Appellate Procedure, and Bankruptcy Procedure, (4) Performs alphabetical sorting of found sections to determine the fifth position, (5) Saves all findings and results to workspace files for further analysis. The code includes robust error handling and alternative approaches if direct access fails, ensuring comprehensive data collection for identifying the target federal rules section.",

The script accessed Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website, extracted all federal rules sections, and correctly identified the fifth section alphabetically. The code found 6 total federal rules categories: Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Federal Rules of Evidence, and U.S. Supreme Court Rules. After alphabetical sorting, it correctly determined that 'Federal Rules of Evidence' is the fifth section alphabetically. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all objectives achieved including website navigation, federal rules identification, alphabetical ordering, and target section identification.

This comprehensive approach: (1) Loads existing analysis data to get all article links, (2) Accesses each article individually using proper HTTP requests, (3) Parses HTML content to extract all rule titles from both links and text patterns, (4) Counts occurrences of 'witnesses' in rule titles using case-insensitive matching, (5) Also counts total 'witnesses' mentions on each page for context, (6) Saves HTML content of each article for further analysis, (7) Ranks all articles by witnesses count to identify the winner, (8) Saves comprehensive results including detailed data for each article. This systematic analysis will definitively identify which article contains the most 'witnesses' references in rule titles, setting up for the final step of examining Rule 1's amendment history in that article.",

The script successfully accessed all 11 articles, analyzed their content, and determined that ARTICLE VII. OPINIONS AND EXPERT TESTIMONY contains the most 'witnesses' references in rule titles (10 total), followed by ARTICLE VI. WITNESSES (4 total). The code properly saved HTML files for each article, generated comprehensive analysis data, and identified the winner article. **PLAN** alignment: 70% complete - successfully found Rule 1 (Rule 101), systematically analyzed all articles for 'witnesses' count, and identified the winning article. The output shows detailed results with ARTICLE VII as the winner containing 10 'witnesses' references in rule titles. Next step needed: Access Rule 1 (Rule 101) within ARTICLE VII to examine its amendment history and identify the most recently deleted word from amendments. Recommendation: Save the comprehensive results file as suggested and proceed to analyze Rule 101's amendment history in the winning article.",

    "description": "Completing the final step of the PLAN by accessing Rule 101 (Rule 1) directly to examine its amendment history and identify deleted words. This comprehensive approach: (1) Inspects the comprehensive results file structure to understand the winning article data, (2) Accesses Rule 101's individual page at Cornell Law, (3) Searches for amendment history using multiple pattern matching approaches including 'Amendment History', 'Pub. L.', 'effective dates', and deletion language, (4) Specifically looks for deleted/struck/removed words using targeted regex patterns, (5) Searches for recent amendments from 2020-2024 to identify the most recent changes, (6) Extracts and analyzes context around all amendment references, (7) Saves comprehensive analysis data including all amendment references, deleted words, and recent changes. This systematic analysis will identify the specific word that was deleted in the most recent amendment to Rule 1, completing all PLAN objectives.",

    "feedback": 'Execution failed - SyntaxError at line 145 due to improper string escaping in regex patterns. The code attempted to use raw strings with regex patterns containing both single and double quotes, causing unterminated string literal errors. Multiple regex patterns like `r\'deleted.*?["\\\']([^"\\\']*)["\\\']\\\'` have incorrect quote escaping that breaks Python syntax. **PLAN** alignment: 70% - previous steps successfully identified Rule 1 (Rule 101) and determined ARTICLE VII contains the most \'witnesses\' references (10 total), but current code fails due to syntax errors in regex patterns for finding deleted words in amendment history. Recommended fix: Replace the problematic regex patterns with properly escaped versions, such as using double quotes for outer strings or fixing the raw string quote escaping: `r\'deleted.*?["\\\']([^"\\\']*)["\\\']\\\'` should be `r\'deleted.*?["\\\']([^"\\\']*)["\\\']\\\'` or use alternative quote combinations to avoid conflicts.',

    "description": "Fixed the syntax error in regex patterns by properly escaping quotes and completing the final step of analyzing Rule 101's amendment history. This corrected approach: (1) Inspects the comprehensive results file to understand the winning article data, (2) Accesses Rule 101's individual page at Cornell Law with proper error handling, (3) Searches for amendment history using multiple pattern matching approaches including 'Amendment History', 'Pub. L.', 'effective dates', and deletion language, (4) Uses properly escaped regex patterns to find deleted/struck/removed words, including both quoted and unquoted patterns, (5) Searches for recent amendments from 2020-2024 to identify the most recent changes, (6) Examines HTML structure for amendment sections, (7) Saves comprehensive analysis data including all amendment references, deleted words, and recent changes. This systematic analysis will identify the specific word that was deleted in the most recent amendment to Rule 1, completing all PLAN objectives including finding Rule 1, identifying the article with most 'witnesses' references, and examining Rule 1's amendment history.",

    "feedback": 'Execution failed - SyntaxError at line 146 due to incorrect syntax in regex pattern list. The code has double commas \',,\' after several regex patterns in the deletion_patterns list, which creates invalid Python syntax. The error occurs in patterns like `r"deleted.*?[\'"]([^\'"]*)[\'"]",,` where the double comma breaks the list structure. **PLAN** alignment: 75% complete - successfully found Rule 1 (Rule 101), systematically analyzed all articles, identified Article VII as containing the most \'witnesses\' references (10 total), and attempted to access Rule 101\'s amendment history, but execution failed due to syntax errors. Recommended fix: Remove the double commas from the deletion_patterns list - change `r"deleted.*?[\'"]([^\'"]*)[\'"]",,` to `r"deleted.*?[\'"]([^\'"]*)[\'"]"` and fix similar syntax errors in other patterns. The approach is correct but needs syntax correction to complete the final step of identifying deleted words from Rule 1 amendments.',

    "description": "Completing the final step of the PLAN by fixing all syntax errors and conducting comprehensive analysis of Rule 101's amendment history. This corrected approach: (1) Properly inspects the comprehensive results file to understand the winning article (Article VII with 10 'witnesses' references), (2) Accesses Rule 101's individual page at Cornell Law with proper error handling, (3) Searches for amendment history using multiple pattern matching approaches including 'Amendment History', 'Pub. L.', 'effective dates', and deletion language, (4) Uses properly formatted regex patterns (fixed double commas and quote escaping) to find deleted/struck/removed words, including both quoted and unquoted patterns, (5) Searches for recent amendments from 2020-2024 to identify the most recent changes, (6) Examines HTML structure for amendment sections, (7) Adds specific patterns to find the most recent amendment details, (8) Saves comprehensive analysis data including all amendment references, deleted words, and recent changes. This systematic analysis will identify the specific word that was deleted in the most recent amendment to Rule 1, completing all PLAN objectives: finding Rule 1, identifying the article with most 'witnesses' references, and examining Rule 1's amendment history for deleted words.",

The code attempted to use raw strings with complex quote escaping that resulted in unterminated string literal errors. The problematic pattern `r\'deleted.*?["\\\']([^"\\\']*)["\\\'\']\',` has incorrect quote escaping that breaks Python syntax. **PLAN** alignment: 75% complete - successfully found Rule 1 (Rule 101), systematically analyzed all articles, identified Article VII as containing the most \'witnesses\' references (10 total), and attempted to access Rule 101\'s amendment history, but execution failed due to regex syntax errors. Recommended fix: Replace the problematic regex patterns with properly escaped versions using double quotes for outer strings: change `r\'deleted.*?["\\\']([^"\\\']*)["\\\'\']\',` to `r"deleted.*?[\'\\"]([^\'\\"]*)[\'\\"]"` or use simpler quote combinations to avoid escaping conflicts.

This implementation: (1) First inspects existing workspace files to understand available data and check for previously downloaded Rule 101 HTML, (2) Uses existing Rule 101 HTML file if available, or downloads it fresh from Cornell Law, (3) Employs simplified, properly escaped regex patterns to avoid syntax errors - using double quotes for outer strings and avoiding complex quote escaping, (4) Searches for deleted words using multiple simple patterns like \'deleted the word "X"\', \'struck "X"\', etc., (5) Searches for recent amendments by year (2020-2024) with specific date patterns, (6) Looks for specific amendment dates including April 2023 and December 2023 effective dates, (7) Saves comprehensive final analysis including all findings, (8) Provides complete PLAN summary showing all objectives achieved. This corrected approach will successfully identify the most recently deleted word from Rule 1\'s amendment history, completing all PLAN objectives: finding Rule 1 (Rule 101), identifying Article VII as having the most \'witnesses\' references (10 total), and examining Rule 1\'s amendment history for deleted words.',

The code has been attempting to analyze Rule 101's amendment history but keeps failing on regex syntax errors with quote escaping. However, looking at the **CURRENT CODE OUTPUT**, the execution was successful up to accessing Rule 101 and found 0 deleted words, 0 recent amendments, and 0 amendment dates. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - the code successfully: (1) Found Rule 1 (Rule 101), (2) Analyzed all 11 articles systematically, (3) Identified Article VII as containing the most 'witnesses' references (10 total), (4) Accessed Rule 101 and searched for amendment history, (5) Completed comprehensive analysis showing no deleted words were found in the amendment history.

    "description": "Conducting a comprehensive final inspection of the Rule 101 HTML file to ensure no amendment history details were missed. This thorough approach: (1) Loads and analyzes the actual Rule 101 HTML file downloaded in previous iterations, (2) Examines the full text content line by line for amendment-related keywords, (3) Searches for all years and dates mentioned in the document, (4) Looks specifically for Public Law references (Pub. L.) which indicate legislative amendments, (5) Searches for effective date references that would indicate when amendments took effect, (6) Analyzes the context around any amendment-related content found, (7) Saves detailed inspection results for comprehensive documentation, (8) Provides final PLAN completion summary with definitive answers. This ensures we have thoroughly examined Rule 101's amendment history and can confidently answer the PLAN question about deleted words, completing all objectives: finding Rule 1 (Rule 101), identifying Article VII as having the most 'witnesses' references (10 total), and examining Rule 1's amendment history for any deleted words.",
