# Planner Initialization

## Task
On Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has "witnesses" in the most titles as of 2021?

## Episodic Examples
### The phrase removed was: "**Dragons are real and live in the hearts of daring princesses**"

**TASK**: On a leap day before the year 2008, a joke was removed from the Wikipedia page for “Dragon”. What was the phrase that was removed? Give the phrase as it appeared on the page, but without punctuation.

```

### Fact-Checking Greetham Citation: Verifying Quoted Passage from ‘Uncoupled’ Article

**TASK**: I need to fact-check a citation. This is the citation from the bibliography:

Greetham, David. "Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)." Textual Cultures: Texts, Contexts, Interpretation, vol. 3 no. 1, 2008, p. 45-46. Project MUSE, doi:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44.

And this is the in-line citation:

Our relationship with the authors of the works we read can often be “obscured not by a "cloak of print" but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission” (Greetham 45-46).

Does the quoted text match what is actually in the article? If Yes, answer Yes, otherwise, give me the word in my citation that does not match with the correct one (without any article).
