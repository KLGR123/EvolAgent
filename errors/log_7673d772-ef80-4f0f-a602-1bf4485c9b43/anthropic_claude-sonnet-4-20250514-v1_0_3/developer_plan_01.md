# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website and locate their federal rules section. Identify all federal rules categories listed alphabetically, then determine which is the fifth section. The goal is to find the section that contains rules with multiple articles having 'witnesses' in their titles, then analyze the first rule in that section to identify what word was deleted in its most recent amendment as of 2021.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the structure of Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute and locate their federal rules organization, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the alphabetically fifth federal rules section and begin mapping which articles contain 'witnesses' in their titles, (4) This creates the foundation for finding the specific rule and amendment information requested in the TASK

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 9: Identify Legume Wikipedia 2022 Content Violations and ‚ÄòR‚Äô Definition in Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Wikipedia editorial oversight: scanning the Legume article‚Äôs public edit logs to detect instances of biased language (NPOV breaches), unverifiable claims (V), and original research (NOR) in edits made throughout 2022 before December, and producing policy-compliance reports.
- Corporate technical documentation audit: analyzing the revision history of an internal engineering wiki to flag unverified design claims and undocumented research insertions, ensuring all technical content meets the company's reliability standards akin to Reliable Sources.
- Social media content policy enforcement: processing comment and post logs on an online community forum to automatically identify and categorize policy infractions‚Äîsuch as defamation, hate speech, or false statements‚Äîmapping them to core policy codes (e.g., V for Verifiability, NOR for No Original Research) for the moderation team.
- Academic research integrity checks: reviewing student thesis draft revisions on a university‚Äôs digital submission portal to uncover any uncited original research (NOR violations) and confirm all assertions are supported by reliable, peer-reviewed sources (RS).
- Newswire fact-checking automation: ingesting document change logs from a news agency‚Äôs content management system to isolate and report additions lacking credible references or containing editorial bias, tagging violations under corresponding core policies and alerting editors in real time.
- E-commerce product description validation: examining change logs in a marketplace platform where sellers update product information, detecting unverifiable claims (V) or overhyped, unsupported details, and enforcing a neutral, research-backed standard before listing goes live.
- Government policy document review: parsing the version history of municipal policy drafts on an open-data portal to identify any introduction of original analysis or shifts in neutral language (NPOV, NOR violations), and summarizing findings for legal compliance and public transparency teams.

### Development Step 3: Identify 2022 Legume Wikipedia content violations and the meaning of ‚ÄúR‚Äù in core policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate compliance auditing for an internal knowledge base: automatically parse HTML edit histories to identify content removals before December 2022, map them against three core documentation policies, and report what ‚ÄúR‚Äù stands for in each policy.
- Academic media studies research on Wikipedia edit behavior: extract 2022 pre-December policy violations and analyze how often core policies (including the ‚ÄúR‚Äù for Reliability) are cited in public logs.
- Newsroom fact-checking workflow: monitor high-traffic Wikipedia pages‚Äô edit history HTML to flag potential vandalism or copyright removals in 2022 and correlate them with the three core policies‚Äô ‚ÄúR‚Äù references.
- Open-source project documentation QA: scan project wiki talk pages‚Äô HTML to detect spam, deletion requests, or policy breaches before December 2022 and verify adherence to the trio of core guidelines, especially the ‚ÄúR‚Äù criterion.
- Legal discovery and e-discovery support: process archived HTML logs from Wikipedia to extract instances of content disputes in 2022, identify the violated policy types, and determine the meaning of ‚ÄúR‚Äù in each policy context.
- Government transparency dashboard: analyze municipal information pages‚Äô edit histories to track policy enforcement actions taken before December 2022 and highlight the role of ‚ÄúR‚Äù (Reliability) in official content standards.
- Nonprofit misinformation monitoring: parse HTML of selected topic pages‚Äô talk and history files to uncover 2022 content violations, categorize them under the three core policies, and detail how ‚ÄúR‚Äù shapes the reliable sourcing rule.
- Enterprise knowledge management automation: integrate a parser for wiki-style HTML logs to continuously detect policy violations (including ‚ÄúR‚Äù-related reliability issues) in user-generated content during 2022‚Äôs first eleven months.

### Development Step 4: 2022 Legume Wikipedia Logs: Identifying Content Violations and the ‚ÄòR‚Äô in Three Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- NGO compliance team auditing Wikipedia edit logs on agricultural topics to flag defamatory or biased content violations before December 2022
- Academic research group analyzing policy breach patterns on the Legume page to study misinformation and content removal trends in 2022
- Fact-checking organization monitoring public edit histories to detect undisclosed conflicts of interest and R-category violations on nutrition-related entries
- Government regulatory body reviewing political neutrality policy compliance in public logs of food and nutrition Wikipedia pages for year-end reporting
- Data journalism team extracting and visualizing the types of content violations and associated core policies from 2022 edit histories for an investigative feature
- Enterprise knowledge management department automating the detection of policy-violating edits in internal wiki logs using a similar analysis pipeline
- Machine learning engineers collecting R-policy labeled examples from public edit logs to train a classifier for automated violation detection

### Development Step 8: Analyzing 2022 Legume Wikipedia Log Violations: Violation Type and ‚ÄúR‚Äù Policy Definition

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Regulatory compliance audits of pharmaceutical Wikipedia pages to verify source reliability and detect No Original Research violations before drug approval submissions
- Media watchdog automated monitoring of political biography edits to flag Neutral Point of View breaches and biased language patterns
- Legal discovery workflows extracting historical revert (RV) actions and Reliable Sources disputes in trademark-related Wikipedia articles for litigation support
- Academic research data pipelines aggregating policy violation incidents across STEM entries to analyze trends in misinformation and editorial bias
- NGO crisis response teams tracking Verifiability breaches and unverified health claims on disaster-related Wikipedia pages to ensure accurate public information
- Corporate brand management platforms monitoring unauthorized promotional edits in product and competitor Wikipedia articles to safeguard brand integrity
- Wikipedia training programs leveraging real-world violation case studies from the Legume page to educate new editors on NPOV, Verifiability, and No Original Research policies

### Development Step 6: Identify 2022 Legume Wikipedia Content Violations Before December and the ‚ÄòR‚Äô in Three Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate knowledge base compliance auditing: scanning internal wiki logs for policy breaches (e.g., NPOV, Verifiability, NOR) and automatically generating violation reports
- Legal team wiki content review for copyright infringement: parsing edit histories to identify removed or reverted content due to alleged copyright violations in 2022
- Academic research on collaborative content governance: analyzing Wikipedia talk pages and revision logs to study policy violation patterns and their resolutions
- Non-profit NGO media monitoring: tracking changes on advocacy-related Wikipedia pages to detect vandalism or biased edits and ensure neutrality
- Automated documentation pipeline in software development: integrating violation scanning to flag policy breaches in project documentation before publication
- Government agency digital archive auditing: reviewing web archive captures to identify and document policy violations on public information pages for regulatory compliance
- Media company brand monitoring: analyzing Wikipedia page edits and removal incidents to detect vandalism or misinformation about company products and mitigate reputational risks
- University academic integrity assessment: auditing student-contributed wiki revisions to enforce "No Original Research" policy and Verifiability guidelines in coursework
