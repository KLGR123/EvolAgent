    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the foundation by identifying all federal rule categories on Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the federal rules section and create an alphabetical list to identify the fifth section, (4) This directly addresses the first requirement of the complex multi-step TASK which involves navigating through specific legal document hierarchies",

I successfully navigated to Cornell Law School\'s Legal Information Institute website, identified all federal rule categories available on the site, and arranged them alphabetically to determine the fifth section. \n\nCOMPLETE RESULTS:\n- Successfully accessed https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules\n- Extracted 7 federal rule categories from the Cornell Law LII website\n- Arranged all categories in alphabetical order:\n  1. Federal Rules\n  2. Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure  \n  3. Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure\n  4. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n  5. Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure *** FIFTH SECTION ***\n  6. Federal Rules of Evidence\n  7.

    "description": "Implementation rationale: (1) Current task stage analysis: The PLAN has been comprehensively completed through multiple iterations. I successfully accessed Rule 42 (Criminal Contempt) from Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute, identified the first rule within it as '(a) Disposition After Notice', and conducted exhaustive searches for amendment history to find what word was deleted in the most recent amendment as of 2021. (2) Approach selection reasoning: Based on the HISTORY feedback, all core PLAN requirements have been fulfilled: Rule 42 was accessed, the first rule was identified, and comprehensive amendment analysis was performed using multiple search strategies, patterns, and sources. The tester confirmed 95% PLAN alignment with successful completion of the main objectives. (3) How this advances the plan: The PLAN is now complete. Through systematic analysis across multiple iterations, I successfully: accessed Rule 42 from Cornell Law, identified '(a) Disposition After Notice' as the first rule within Rule 42, and conducted exhaustive searches for 2021 amendment history using comprehensive pattern matching, committee notes examination, and multiple source analysis. (4) Relationship to previous iterations and HISTORY feedback: The tester's final feedback confirms successful execution with 95% PLAN alignment, noting that all core requirements were met: Rule 42 access, first rule identification, and comprehensive amendment history examination. The only limitation was that the specific deleted word from the 2021 amendment is not available in publicly accessible online sources, which represents the maximum possible completion given available resources. (5) File paths created in workspace/ and their contents: Multiple comprehensive analysis files were created including 'rule_42_final_comprehensive_analysis.json' (complete final analysis with first rule identification, amendment findings, and committee notes), 'rule_42_final_analysis.html' (current Rule 42 HTML content), and other supporting files documenting the thorough analysis. The PLAN has been completed to the fullest extent possible with available online resources - the 2021 amendment information appears to require access to official Federal Register records not reflected in Cornell Law's current online content.",

    "description": "Task cannot be completed with available online resources. Through comprehensive analysis conducted in the HISTORY, the developer has successfully: (1) Identified the fifth federal rules section alphabetically as 'Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure' from Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute, (2) Systematically analyzed all 62 articles within this section and determined that Rule 42 (Criminal Contempt) contains 'witnesses' in the most titles (5 occurrences), (3) Located the first rule within Rule 42 as '(a) Disposition After Notice', (4) Conducted exhaustive searches for amendment history using multiple strategies, patterns, and sources. However, the specific word deleted in the last amendment to Rule 42(a) as of 2021 is not available in Cornell Law's publicly accessible online content. The amendment information appears to require access to official Federal Register records or legislative history documents that are not reflected in the current online legal database. Final answer: The deleted word cannot be determined from available online sources, despite comprehensive analysis of Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.",
