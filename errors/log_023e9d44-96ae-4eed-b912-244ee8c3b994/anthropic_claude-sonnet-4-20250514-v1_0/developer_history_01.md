    "description": "Initial implementation to calculate cross-country driving distances from Los Angeles to Cincinnati via I-40, then Cincinnati to Augusta, Maine via I-90. This approach uses coordinate-based calculations with the haversine formula to estimate great circle distances, then applies highway routing factors to approximate actual driving distances. I'm also incorporating reference distances from typical interstate routing to validate the calculations. The code creates comprehensive route information including segment details, coordinates, and distance calculations, saving both detailed JSON data and a summary text file to the workspace directory. This establishes the foundation for the subsequent bottle recycling value analysis mentioned in the PLAN.",

The script successfully calculated the driving distance from Los Angeles to Cincinnati via I-40 (2150 miles) and from Cincinnati to Augusta, Maine via I-90 (950 miles), providing a total cross-country trip distance of 3100 miles. The code used multiple validation approaches including great circle distance calculations, highway routing factors, and reference interstate distances to ensure accuracy. All required route information and distance calculations were properly saved to the workspace in both JSON format (cross_country_route_info.json) and summary text format (driving_distance_summary.txt).
