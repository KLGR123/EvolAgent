Save the route information and total distance calculation to the workspace for subsequent bottle recycling value analysis.',
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the total driving distance to calculate how many water bottles will be consumed during the trip, (2) The TASK specifies exact interstate routes (I-40 from LA to Cincinnati, then I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta) that require precise distance measurement, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the total mileage which will be used to calculate bottle consumption at 5 bottles per 100 miles, (4) This foundational distance calculation is essential before we can determine recycling values from Wikipedia's bottle deposit information.",
