# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Research the driving distance from Los Angeles, California to Augusta, Maine following the specified route: I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, then I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta. Use mapping services, route calculators, or distance databases to determine the total mileage for this cross-country journey. Focus on obtaining the most accurate total distance measurement that accounts for the specific interstate highways mentioned in the route.

## Description
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to establish the total driving distance to calculate water bottle consumption (5 bottles per 100 miles), (2) No previous research has been conducted on this route, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the precise mileage from LA to Augusta via I-40 and I-90, (4) This distance calculation is essential for determining the number of water bottles that will be recycled and subsequently the deposit refund amount

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 28: Cities of Westernmost (Santa Clara University) and Easternmost (UMass Boston) Universities

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- Interstate freight route planning for logistics companies optimizing delivery schedules between Santa Clara and Boston campus distribution centers
- Comparative climatology research measuring temperature and precipitation variation at the westernmost (Santa Clara) and easternmost (Boston) university locations
- Automated geofencing and alerting system monitoring traffic congestion or severe weather events around Santa Clara and Boston campuses
- Targeted alumni fundraising campaign segmenting supporters at the coastal extremes of the university network (Santa Clara vs. Boston)
- Cloud server provisioning strategy selecting data center endpoints closest to Santa Clara and Boston for minimum latency connections
- Multi-city educational campus tour planner generating itineraries that start in Santa Clara and conclude in Boston
- Student housing investment analysis comparing rental market trends near the westernmost and easternmost university sites
- Academic telehealth access study evaluating healthcare service availability in Santa Clara and Boston university communities
