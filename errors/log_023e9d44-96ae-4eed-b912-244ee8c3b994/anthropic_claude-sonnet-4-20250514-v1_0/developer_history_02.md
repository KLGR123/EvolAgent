This approach uses coordinate-based calculations with the haversine formula to estimate great circle distances, then applies highway routing factors to approximate actual driving distances. I'm also incorporating reference distances from typical interstate routing to validate the calculations.

    "description": "This implementation completes the PLAN by researching Maine's bottle deposit law on Wikipedia and calculating the total recycling refund value. I search the Wikipedia page on container deposit legislation in the United States, looking specifically for Maine deposit information. I also attempt to access a Maine-specific bottle bill page for more detailed information. Based on the research, I determine that Maine has a 5-cent deposit per bottle (standard for most beverage containers including water bottles). I then load the previously calculated bottle consumption data (200 bottles) and calculate the total refund: 200 bottles × $0.05 = $10.00. The complete analysis including trip summary, Maine deposit law details, and recycling refund calculation is saved to the workspace. This fully addresses all PLAN requirements: calculating bottle consumption, researching Maine's deposit law, and determining the total dollar amount for recycling in Augusta, Maine.",
