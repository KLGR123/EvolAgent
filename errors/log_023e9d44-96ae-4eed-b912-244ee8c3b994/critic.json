  "reason": "Task analysis: Calculate total recycling refund for water bottles consumed during cross-country drive from LA to Augusta, Maine via specified interstate routes (I-40 then I-90), with consumption rate of 5 bottles per 100 miles rounded to nearest 100. Individual evaluation: Member 1 calculated 3,100 total miles, leading to 155 bottles rounded to 200 bottles, yielding $10.00 refund with Maine's 5-cent deposit. Member 2 calculated 3,000 total miles, leading to 150 bottles (no rounding needed), yielding $7.50 refund. Member 3 calculated 3,415.43 miles rounded to 3,400 miles, leading to 170 bottles, yielding $8.50 refund. Cross-analysis reveals significant distance calculation divergence (3,000-3,415 miles) but consensus on Maine's 5-cent deposit rate from Wikipedia research. Critical evaluation: All members correctly researched Maine's bottle deposit law, but differed substantially in distance calculations. Member 1's 3,100-mile calculation represents the most reasonable estimate for the LA-Cincinnati-Augusta route via I-40/I-90, as Member 2's 3,000 miles appears underestimated for this cross-country distance, while Member 3's 3,415 miles seems slightly overestimated. Rounding methodology assessment: Member 1 correctly applied 'rounded to nearest 100' to the bottle count (155â†’200), while Members 2 and 3 applied rounding to distance rather than bottles. The task specifies 'I drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles I travel, rounded to the nearest 100' - this phrasing indicates the rounding applies to the consumption calculation, not the distance. Synthesis: Member 1's approach demonstrates superior methodological accuracy in both distance estimation and rounding interpretation, supported by comprehensive Wikipedia research confirming Maine's 5-cent deposit rate.",
