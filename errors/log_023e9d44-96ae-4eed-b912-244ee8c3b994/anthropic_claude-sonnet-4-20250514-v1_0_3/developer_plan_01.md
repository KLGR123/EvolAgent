# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Research the driving distance from Los Angeles, California to Cincinnati, Ohio via Interstate 40, and then from Cincinnati, Ohio to Augusta, Maine via Interstate 90. Calculate the total mileage for this cross-country route and determine how many water bottles will be consumed based on the rate of 5 bottles per 100 miles traveled (rounded to the nearest 100 miles).

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the total driving distance to calculate water bottle consumption, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this route, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain accurate mileage data for both I-40 (LA to Cincinnati) and I-90 (Cincinnati to Augusta) segments, (4) This provides the foundation needed to calculate the number of water bottles that will be recycled and determine the refund amount according to Wikipedia's bottle deposit information

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Indiana’s First Governor, 23.6-Mile I-65 Naming Resolution, and 1783 County Origins

**Description**: Research Indiana's first governor to identify who this person was, then search for information about a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 that was named in their honor. Focus on finding when the Indiana legislative body passed the resolution to designate this highway section. Additionally, identify which Indiana county was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 to determine the specific location of this Interstate 65 section.

**Use Cases**:
- State transportation departments automating extraction of legislative resolutions and highway naming details to update GIS asset databases and ensure accurate route signage
- Historical societies compiling interconnected colonial-era county boundaries and modern infrastructure designations for curated museum exhibits and educational materials
- Urban planners integrating memorial highway designations and legislative history into comprehensive city development reports and public consultation documents
- Academic researchers conducting comparative analyses of state commemorative practices by correlating governors’ tenures with named transportation corridors and passage dates
- Newsrooms generating enriched multimedia timelines for feature articles on infrastructure naming controversies by programmatically retrieving legislative records and historical county data
- Legal teams verifying the legislative authority and specific dates behind highway naming agreements to support compliance audits and drafting of municipal ordinances
- Tourism app developers embedding contextual historical narratives—such as colonial county origins and governor memorial dedications—into driving route guides to enhance traveler engagement

### Development Step 4: Indiana’s First Governor’s Namesake 23.6-Mile I-65 Section: Resolution Date and County

**Description**: Research Indiana's first governor to identify who this person was, then search for information about a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 that was named in their honor. Focus on finding when the Indiana legislative body passed the resolution to designate this highway section. Additionally, identify which Indiana county was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 to determine the specific location of this Interstate 65 section.

**Use Cases**:
- Transportation GIS asset management and memorial highway resolution indexing for state Departments of Transportation
- Legislative archival workflow automation and metadata extraction for public records in state archives
- Historical tourism app content curation and timeline generation linking colonial counties to modern infrastructures
- Government affairs monitoring and analysis of highway naming resolutions for lobbying firms and policy consultants
- Educational module development and interactive timeline creation for university state history courses
- Map publisher compliance verification and design validation of memorial highway naming based on legislative statutes
- Civic tech transparency dashboard creation for citizens to explore transportation asset naming and resolution data
- Academic geospatial research and demographic analysis correlating 18th-century county boundaries with present-day highway routes

### Development Step 3: First Indiana governor honored I-65 segment: resolution date and county location

**Description**: Research Indiana's first governor to identify who this person was, then search for information about a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 that was named in their honor. Focus on finding when the Indiana legislative body passed the resolution to designate this highway section. Additionally, identify which Indiana county was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 to determine the specific location of this Interstate 65 section.

**Use Cases**:
- State Department of Transportation automating extraction of legislative resolutions and generating signage metadata for highway renaming ceremonies
- State archives and historical society compiling JSON-based research summaries on Indiana governors and county origins for digital exhibit catalogs
- Legal analysts cross-referencing colonial charter records with modern legislative acts to audit jurisdictional changes and boundary formations
- GIS specialists overlaying 1783 Virginia county boundaries with current I-65 route data to support infrastructure planning and mapping projects
- Educational content developers producing interactive timelines and lesson plans on Indiana statehood and highway naming using structured research outputs
- Journalists automating the extraction of key facts from legislative documents and search results to generate rapid news briefs on state government actions
- Genealogists correlating 18th-century land claims in Jefferson County, Virginia with present-day Clark County, Indiana through JSON-driven data pipelines

### Development Step 28: Cities of Westernmost (Santa Clara University) and Easternmost (UMass Boston) Universities

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- Interstate freight route planning for logistics companies optimizing delivery schedules between Santa Clara and Boston campus distribution centers
- Comparative climatology research measuring temperature and precipitation variation at the westernmost (Santa Clara) and easternmost (Boston) university locations
- Automated geofencing and alerting system monitoring traffic congestion or severe weather events around Santa Clara and Boston campuses
- Targeted alumni fundraising campaign segmenting supporters at the coastal extremes of the university network (Santa Clara vs. Boston)
- Cloud server provisioning strategy selecting data center endpoints closest to Santa Clara and Boston for minimum latency connections
- Multi-city educational campus tour planner generating itineraries that start in Santa Clara and conclude in Boston
- Student housing investment analysis comparing rental market trends near the westernmost and easternmost university sites
- Academic telehealth access study evaluating healthcare service availability in Santa Clara and Boston university communities
