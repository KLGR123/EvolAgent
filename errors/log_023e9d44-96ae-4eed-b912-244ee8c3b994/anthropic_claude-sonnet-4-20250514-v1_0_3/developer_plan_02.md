# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Calculate the total number of water bottles consumed during the 3,415.43-mile journey using the specified consumption rate of 5 bottles per 100 miles (rounded to the nearest 100 miles). Then research Maine's bottle deposit program on Wikipedia to determine the refund rate per bottle as of May 2023, and calculate the total refund amount in dollars.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have the total driving distance of 3,415.43 miles from the previous route calculation, (2) We need to apply the consumption formula (5 bottles per 100 miles, rounded to nearest 100) to determine total bottles, (3) Expected outcome is to find Maine's bottle deposit rate from Wikipedia and calculate the final refund amount, (4) This completes the TASK by combining the distance calculation with bottle consumption rate and Maine's recycling refund program to determine the total dollar amount returned.
