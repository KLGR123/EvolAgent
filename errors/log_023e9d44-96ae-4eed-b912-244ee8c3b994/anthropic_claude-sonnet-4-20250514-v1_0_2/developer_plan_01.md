# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Calculate the driving distance from Los Angeles to Cincinnati via I-40, then from Cincinnati to Augusta, Maine via I-90. Use mapping services or route planning tools to determine the total mileage for this cross-country trip, ensuring accuracy for the subsequent water bottle consumption calculation.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the total driving distance to calculate water bottle consumption based on the 5 bottles per 100 miles ratio, (2) No previous distance research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain accurate mileage figures for both route segments (LA to Cincinnati via I-40, Cincinnati to Augusta via I-90), (4) This provides the foundation for calculating total water bottles consumed and subsequent recycling value based on state bottle deposit laws.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Parse Road Map to Identify Houses by Mile Markers and Compute Distances to Towers

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached file data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt to understand the road layout, identify all house positions, and map their locations relative to mile markers. Extract the visual representation showing dashes (-) as mile markers and H symbols as houses, then determine the coordinate system and calculate distances between houses and potential tower locations.

**Use Cases**:
- Telecom network planners determining optimal cell tower placements along rural highways to minimize average signal distance to homes clustered above and below the road
- Emergency services designing ambulance station or firehouse locations based on household positions along major roadways to reduce response times
- Broadband internet providers mapping potential distribution hub sites along a trunk route to ensure equitable coverage for properties on both sides of the highway
- Utility companies scheduling meter-reading and maintenance by calculating distances from main gas or water pipelines to residential units distributed along a linear corridor
- School transportation coordinators optimizing bus stop placements by analyzing student home mile‐marker positions relative to the bus route
- Real estate developers evaluating proximity of new housing parcels to proposed infrastructure expansions (roads, power lines) for investment decision support
- Environmental planners modeling roadside noise-barrier or greenbelt placement by assessing residential distance metrics from the highway
- Logistics and courier services planning drop‐off zones along delivery routes to minimize total travel and idle time when servicing homes on either side of the roadway

### Development Step 5: ASEAN Capitals Great-Circle Distance Matrix with Furthest-Separated Capital Pair Analysis

**Description**: Calculate the geographical distances between all possible pairs of ASEAN capital cities using the coordinate data from workspace/asean_complete_coordinates.json. Apply the haversine formula to compute great circle distances between each pair of capitals, then identify which two countries have the maximum distance between their capital cities. Create a comprehensive distance matrix showing all pairwise distances and determine the two ASEAN member countries whose capitals are geographically furthest apart.

**Use Cases**:
- Logistics network optimization for a regional freight company planning the most efficient trucking routes between ASEAN capitals
- Airline route feasibility analysis for a budget carrier evaluating direct flight distances and fuel requirements between capital cities
- Multinational retailer site selection, determining optimal warehouse locations based on average distances to member capitals

### Development Step 11: Eliud Kipchoge’s Time to Run 356,400 km at 20.90 km/h, Rounded to Nearest 1000 Hours

**Description**: Calculate the time required for Eliud Kipchoge to run the Earth-Moon minimum perigee distance using his marathon world record pace. Use Kipchoge's pace of 20.90 km/h from the previous analysis and the minimum perigee distance of 356,400 km from the Moon's Wikipedia page. Convert the result to thousand hours and round to the nearest 1000 hours as specified in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Physics education module calculating time-distance relationships by having students use Eliud Kipchoge’s marathon pace to run the Earth-Moon perigee distance, reinforcing kinematics and unit conversions.
- Science museum interactive exhibit where visitors input various running speeds (e.g., Kipchoge’s 20.90 km/h) to compute and visualize time required to cover astronomical distances, teaching STEM concepts through engagement.
- Sports analytics seminar demonstrating how elite runner paces translate into extreme endurance scenarios—like hypothetically running to the Moon—to illustrate pacing strategies and the importance of rounding rules in performance projections.
- EdTech programming workshop guiding learners step-by-step through building a Python script that calculates distance/speed/time, applies rounding to the nearest 1,000 hours, and exports results to JSON for data literacy education.
- Data engineering training exercise showing how to design a simple ETL pipeline: ingest known constants, perform calculations, enforce rounding policies, and persist outputs in a workspace for downstream analytics.
- Science journalism feature generating infographic-ready figures by computing and rounding the time it would take a world-record marathoner to reach lunar perigee, making complex astronomical scales relatable to the general public.
- Video game development tool that uses realistic pacing algorithms to assign in-game durations for ultra-long “moon run” events, rounding gameplay time to thousand-hour blocks for narrative consistency.
- Corporate business intelligence workshop modeling how to automate metric calculations—distance, speed, time—with custom rounding requirements and saving results in JSON to integrate into executive dashboards.
