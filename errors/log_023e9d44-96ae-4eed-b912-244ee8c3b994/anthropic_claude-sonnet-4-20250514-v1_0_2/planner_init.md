# Planner Initialization

## Task
It's May 2023, and I'm about to drive across the U.S. from California to Maine. I always recycle my water bottles at the end of a trip, and I drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles I travel, rounded to the nearest 100. Assuming I follow I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, then take I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta, how many dollars will I get back according to Wikipedia?

### Fewest Wikipedia clicks from Lord of the Rings to A Song of Ice and Fire

**TASK**: What is the minimum number of page links a person must click on to go from the english Wikipedia page on The Lord of the Rings (the book) to the english Wikipedia page on A Song of Ice and Fire (the book series)? In your count, include each link you would click on to get to the page. Use the pages as they appeared at the end of the day on July 3, 2023.

### Calculate hours for Kipchoge at record marathon pace to cover Earth-Moon perigee distance

**TASK**: If Eliud Kipchoge could maintain his record-making marathon pace indefinitely, how many thousand hours would it take him to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon its closest approach?
