The code includes comprehensive route details specifying actual highway connections (I-10→I-40→I-64→I-71 for segment 1, I-71→I-90→I-495→I-95 for segment 2) and saves detailed results to workspace/cross_country_driving_distance.json for the subsequent water bottle calculation phase.

All potable liquids, except dairy and unprocessed cider. All glass, metal, or plastic containers 4\xa0L (135\xa0U.S.\xa0fl\xa0oz) or smaller, excluding blueberry juice and apple cider produced in Maine.[21] Redemption centers are paid a processing fee of 3 to 4¢ per container by the distributor.[22] There are some redemption centers that pay the clients in excess of deposit value, sharing part of the fee they receive from the distributor to encourage them to conduct business at the store.[23] A redemption provider called CLYNK operates a drop-off redemption processing service in collaboration with Hannaford stores. The customer creates an account and drop off bags filled with cans and receive the deposit into their account after the containers have been counted.[24][25] In October 2019, a CLYNK customer complained to WGME-TV alleging that CLYNK counted incorrectly four out of five times. The news channel\'s investigative team conducted their own test dropping off two bags that have been counted twice, loaded with $8.85 worth of containers. CLYNK shorted the news team by $1.15.[25]\n\nSection 3:\n^ Flaherty, Nora (7 March 2016). "Why Some Redemption Centers Give 6 Cents a Bottle When Deposit is Only 5". www.mainepublic.org.

    "description": "The PLAN has been completely and successfully executed. Based on the HISTORY, both major components have been fully implemented and verified by the tester: (1) Water bottle consumption calculation: Successfully calculated 150 bottles consumed during the 3,000-mile cross-country trip using the specified rate of 5 bottles per 100 miles with proper rounding, and (2) Maine bottle deposit law research: Successfully researched Maine's bottle deposit law on Wikipedia, extracting comprehensive information showing Maine has a 5-cent deposit on water bottles. The final calculation shows a total recycling value of $7.50 (150 bottles × $0.05 = $7.50) when recycling in Augusta, Maine. The tester confirmed 'Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completely fulfilled all PLAN requirements' and stated 'The PLAN has been 100% completed - no further development is needed.' All results have been properly saved to workspace/water_bottle_recycling_calculation.json with comprehensive details including trip information, bottle calculations, deposit law research, and final recycling value. The task is complete with accurate mathematical calculations and thorough research verification.",
