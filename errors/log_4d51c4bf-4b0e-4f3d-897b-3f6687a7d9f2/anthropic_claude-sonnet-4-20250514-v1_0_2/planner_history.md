    "plan": "Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/4d51c4bf-4b0e-4f3d-897b-3f6687a7d9f2.xlsx to extract the complete client list for the retractable awning company. Focus on identifying each client's street address number to determine house orientation - odd-numbered addresses face east (requiring sunrise-blocking awnings) and even-numbered addresses face west (requiring sunset-blocking awnings). Count how many clients have even-numbered street addresses since these will receive the sunset awning design.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the Excel file structure and extract all client data including street addresses before determining awning design requirements, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete client data with street address numbers identified to categorize clients by house orientation, (4) This provides the foundation needed to count clients with even-numbered addresses who will receive sunset awning designs as requested in the TASK',

The analysis of the retractable awning company's Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/4d51c4bf-4b0e-4f3d-897b-3f6687a7d9f2.xlsx has been fully executed with the following results:\n\n**Task Completion Summary:**\n1. ✅ Successfully extracted complete client list (12 clients total)\n2. ✅ Identified each client's street address number using regex pattern matching\n3. ✅ Determined house orientation based on odd/even numbering system:\n   - Odd numbers = East-facing houses (need sunrise-blocking awnings)\n   - Even numbers = West-facing houses (need sunset-blocking awnings)\n4. ✅ Counted clients with even-numbered street addresses\n\n**Final Answer:** 4 clients have even-numbered street addresses and will receive sunset-blocking awnings:\n- Michael Scott (8602 Begonia Drive)\n- Pam Beasley (6232 Plumeria Lane) \n- Creed Bratton (2024 Orchid Avenue)\n- William Schneider (2024 Orchid Avenue)\n\n**Files Created:**\n- workspace/raw_client_data.json: Initial client data extraction\n- workspace/awning_client_analysis.json: Complete analysis with orientation classifications\n\n**Verification:** The tester confirmed successful execution with accurate results and no errors. All 12 client addresses were successfully parsed with no invalid addresses requiring manual review. The core question from the PLAN - counting clients with even-numbered addresses for sunset awning design - has been definitively answered as 4 clients.",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive analysis performed by the developer: (1) The Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/4d51c4bf-4b0e-4f3d-897b-3f6687a7d9f2.xlsx was successfully parsed to extract all 12 client records for the retractable awning company, (2) Each client's street address number was identified and categorized based on the regional numbering system where odd addresses face east and even addresses face west, (3) Clients with even-numbered addresses (west-facing houses) require sunset-blocking awnings, (4) The analysis identified exactly 4 clients with even-numbered street addresses: Michael Scott (8602 Begonia Drive), Pam Beasley (6232 Plumeria Lane), Creed Bratton (2024 Orchid Avenue), and William Schneider (2024 Orchid Avenue). Final answer: 4 clients will be receiving the sunset awning design.",
