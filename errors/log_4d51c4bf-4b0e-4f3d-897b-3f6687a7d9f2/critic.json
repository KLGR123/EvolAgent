  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine how many clients will receive sunset awning designs based on street address numbering system where odd addresses face east (sunrise awnings) and even addresses face west (sunset awnings). All three team members demonstrated identical analytical approaches and reached complete consensus. Member evaluation: All members successfully (1) parsed the Excel file containing 12 client records, (2) extracted street address numbers using appropriate regex pattern matching, (3) correctly applied the odd/even addressing logic (odd=east-facing=sunrise, even=west-facing=sunset), (4) identified the same 4 clients with even-numbered addresses: Michael Scott (8602), Pam Beasley (6232), Creed Bratton (2024), and William Schneider (2024). Cross-analysis shows perfect convergence with no contradictions - all members used sound methodological approaches with systematic data extraction, logical categorization, and accurate counting. Each member's reasoning was logically coherent, methodologically appropriate, and computationally accurate. Integration assessment: No synthesis required as all approaches yielded identical results through valid methodologies. Final validation confirms 4 clients have even-numbered street addresses indicating west-facing houses requiring sunset awning designs. Confidence level: maximum, supported by unanimous team consensus and multiple independent verification paths.",
