    "description": "This implementation performs a comprehensive search for the specific GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video from May 14, 2017. I'm using SerpAPI with Google search to execute multiple targeted queries that combine GameGrumps, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the specific date, and YouTube site restrictions. The code calculates relevance scores based on key terms like 'Game Grumps', 'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe', and date-related content. It filters results to focus on YouTube videos, removes duplicates, and ranks candidates by relevance. If a high-confidence match is found (relevance score > 0.5), it extracts the video ID and saves the video information for the next phase - capturing a screenshot at the 2:00 mark to identify the racetrack. The search results are comprehensively logged and saved to workspace files for analysis and follow-up processing.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code executed but is completely misaligned with the PLAN. The output shows content about marine animals (Giant Pacific Octopus, Great White Shark, Blue Whale, Sperm Whale) and Monterey Bay Aquarium searches instead of GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video searches. The code appears to be running a different script entirely - one that searches for aquarium animal information rather than YouTube videos. PLAN alignment: 0% - no GameGrumps video search was performed despite the code containing the correct search logic. This suggests either the wrong code was executed or there's a significant environment/execution issue. Next step: Verify the correct code is being run and ensure the SerpAPI search functionality is working properly for YouTube video searches, not aquarium content.",

    "description": "This corrected implementation addresses the execution issue from the previous attempt. The tester feedback indicated that the code was running content about marine animals instead of GameGrumps video searches, suggesting an environment or execution problem. I've rebuilt the search functionality with better error handling and an alternative approach. The code first checks for the SerpAPI key and if not available, falls back to direct YouTube web scraping using requests and BeautifulSoup. It searches for GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe content using multiple search terms, extracts video information from YouTube search pages, calculates relevance scores based on title content, and identifies the best candidate video. The implementation includes comprehensive logging, saves search results to workspace files, and prepares video information for the next step of extracting a screenshot at the 2:00 mark to identify the racetrack. This approach should successfully find the target GameGrumps video from May 14, 2017.",

The search found relevant GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe videos including 'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: The Grand Prix - PART 7' and compilation videos from May 2017. However, the code appears incomplete - it only shows the search execution phase but doesn't complete the analysis and video identification steps that were present in the previous version. The search results show promising candidates but the relevance scoring, video ID extraction, and final candidate selection logic was not executed. Two workspace files were created (43.2 KB search results and 0.4 KB video info), suggesting some processing occurred. PLAN alignment: 60% - search phase successful but analysis incomplete. Next step: Complete the missing analysis code to process the search results, calculate relevance scores, identify the top candidate video, and extract the video ID for the next phase of capturing a screenshot at the 2:00 mark.",

I first inspect the existing workspace files to understand their structure, then load and analyze the search results JSON file that was created but not fully processed. The code extracts all search results from the executed queries, removes duplicates, filters for YouTube videos, and calculates comprehensive relevance scores based on GameGrumps, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, date, and episode indicators. It prioritizes actual episode videos over compilation videos since we need the specific May 14, 2017 episode. The analysis identifies the best candidate video, extracts the video ID from the YouTube URL, and saves comprehensive video information including the target timestamp (2:00/120 seconds) for the next phase of screenshot extraction. This completes the search and analysis pipeline, preparing for the final step of capturing a screenshot to identify the racetrack being played at the 2-minute mark.',

    "description": "This implementation executes the final phase of the PLAN by extracting a screenshot from the identified GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video at the 2:00 mark. I first inspect the workspace to locate the target video info file created in the previous phase, then extract the video ID (nvaLkvUkW0w) and URL. The code uses a two-step approach: first downloading a 10-second video segment around the 2:00 mark using yt-dlp with ffmpeg, then extracting a high-quality screenshot from that segment using ffmpeg. This method is more reliable than trying to screenshot directly from a stream. The implementation includes comprehensive error handling, progress reporting, and cleanup of temporary files. Once the screenshot is captured, it saves analysis information and prepares for the final step of visually identifying which Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack the GameGrumps hosts are competing on at the 2-minute mark. The screenshot file will be saved as 'gamegrumps_mk8_nvaLkvUkW0w_02m00s.jpg' in the workspace directory.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully extracted a screenshot from the GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video at the 2:00 mark. The implementation used yt-dlp to download a 10-second video segment (115-125 seconds) and then extracted a screenshot using ffmpeg, resulting in a 48.4 KB image file 'gamegrumps_mk8_nvaLkvUkW0w_02m00s.jpg'. The video segment download (1.13 MB) worked correctly, screenshot extraction was successful, and temporary files were properly cleaned up. The code created comprehensive documentation including screenshot analysis info and workspace file listings. PLAN alignment: 100% - The screenshot has been captured from the target GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video at exactly the 2:00 mark as required. The objective is now complete - the screenshot is ready for visual analysis to identify which racetrack the hosts are competing on.

The code confirms that we have successfully: 1) Located the specific GameGrumps video from May 14, 2017 timeframe, 2) Identified 'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: The Grand Prix - PART 7' as the target video, 3) Extracted a high-quality screenshot at exactly the 2:00 mark (48.4 KB image file), and 4) Created all necessary documentation. The screenshot contains the visual information needed to identify which Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack the hosts are competing on. I provide context about the available tracks in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as of May 2017 (game launched April 28, 2017) and document the complete analysis process. The task objective has been achieved - the screenshot is ready for visual identification of the racetrack being played at the two-minute mark.",

The code creates a comprehensive prompt specifically designed for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack identification, including all available tracks organized by cup categories as of May 2017. The prompt instructs GPT-4o to examine track layout, visual elements, environmental features, and any distinctive characteristics that would identify the specific track. The analysis will look for track name displays, background scenery, unique obstacles, and thematic elements. The results are saved to both a text file and JSON summary for documentation. This approach leverages GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities to visually analyze the screenshot and provide the definitive answer about which racetrack the GameGrumps hosts are competing on at the 2:00 mark.",

    "description": "This implementation completes the PLAN by analyzing the successfully captured screenshot to identify the specific Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack. I first locate the screenshot file in the workspace (gamegrumps_mk8_nvaLkvUkW0w_02m00s.jpg), verify it's a valid image format, and encode it to base64 for GPT-4o analysis. The code creates a comprehensive prompt specifically designed for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack identification, including all available tracks organized by cup categories as of May 2017. The prompt instructs GPT-4o to examine track layout, visual elements, environmental features, and any distinctive characteristics that would identify the specific track. The analysis will look for track name displays, background scenery, unique obstacles, and thematic elements. The results are saved to both a text file and JSON summary for documentation. This approach leverages GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities to visually analyze the screenshot and provide the definitive answer about which racetrack the GameGrumps hosts are competing on at the 2:00 mark.",

    "description": "This implementation completes the PLAN by performing a comprehensive visual analysis of the captured screenshot to definitively identify the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack. I locate the screenshot file (gamegrumps_mk8_nvaLkvUkW0w_02m00s.jpg) in the workspace, encode it to base64, and send it to GPT-4o with a detailed analysis prompt. The prompt specifically targets Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack identification, providing all available tracks organized by cup categories as of May 2017, and instructs the AI to examine track layout, visual elements, environmental features, and distinctive characteristics. The analysis results are saved to comprehensive documentation files including both text and JSON formats. This final step leverages GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities to visually examine the screenshot and provide the definitive answer about which specific racetrack the GameGrumps hosts are competing on at the two-minute mark, completing all objectives of the PLAN with full documentation and analysis.",

The implementation used GPT-4o multimodal analysis to examine the captured screenshot and provided a definitive answer: the racetrack is **Mario Circuit (GBA)** from the **Shell Cup** with high confidence. The AI analysis identified distinctive features including a loop structure visible on the mini-map, characteristic GBA track aesthetics with simplified environmental design, red and white racing curbs, and split-screen gameplay showing both players on different sections of the track. The analysis noted the track's basic decorations, outdoor circuit theme with blue skies and green grass, and classic Mario Circuit design elements consistent with the GBA version imported into Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The results were comprehensively documented with detailed visual evidence, track layout analysis, and supporting context clues. PLAN alignment: 100% complete - The GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video was located, screenshot extracted at the 2:00 mark, and the specific racetrack has been definitively identified through professional AI visual analysis.
