# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Analyze the screenshot file workspace/gamegrumps_mk8_nvaLkvUkW0w_02m00s.jpg captured at the 2:00 mark of the GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video to identify which specific racetrack the hosts are competing on. Examine visual elements including track layout, environmental features, background scenery, track name displays, and any distinctive characteristics that would allow definitive identification of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe course being played.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The developer successfully captured the screenshot at exactly the 2:00 mark from the correct GameGrumps video, (2) We now have the visual evidence needed to identify the specific racetrack, (3) Expected outcome is to determine the exact Mario Kart 8 Deluxe track name being played at that timestamp, (4) This identification is essential before we can search for the world record time for that specific track in 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 14: Check START Cell’s Two-Cell Cardinal Neighbors’ Display Text and Hex Fill Colors

**Description**: Inspect workspace/grid_data.json entries for the four cardinal two-cell neighbor coordinates of the START cell by locating the coordinates (start_x±2, start_y) and (start_x, start_y±2) based on the recorded START position in workspace/start_end_coordinates.json; report each neighbor’s displayed text and 6-digit hex fill color to verify which moves from START are actually legal.

**Use Cases**:
- Autonomous warehouse navigation and rack clearance verification, checking two-bin-away grid cells from the forklift’s start position to ensure safe travel paths.
- Robotics competition maze solver, evaluating two-step cardinal moves from the entry cell to identify viable corridors and wall-free zones for path planning.
- Board game AI for a custom “two-square” mover piece, scanning cells at (x±2, y) and (x, y±2) to validate legal moves and color-coded threat areas.
- Pharmaceutical high-throughput screening grid analysis, extracting assay well labels and hex color readouts two wells away from a control sample.
- GIS-based wildfire spread modeling, sampling vegetation density and hex-coded risk levels at two-cell offsets from current fire-start coordinates.
- Pixel-art editing tool that reports text labels and 6-digit hex fill colors of pixels exactly two units away from a selected start pixel for precise color transformations.
- Automated aerial drone flight planner over farmland plots, verifying crop health indicators and color-coded NDVI values at two-field offsets from the launch point.

### Development Step 21: Breadth-First Search from START to END: 11th Two-Cell Move Landing Cell Hex Color

**Description**: Perform a breadth-first search on workspace/adjacency_cardinal.json starting from the START coordinate from workspace/start_end_coordinates.json to find the shortest path to the END coordinate; then identify the coordinate at index 11 in the resulting path (representing the landing cell after the eleventh two-cell move) and retrieve its 6-digit hex fill_color from workspace/grid_data.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Indoor cleaning robot navigation and floor-condition detection by computing the 11th tile on its shortest path and checking its color code to decide vacuum settings
- Augmented reality game level mapping where the engine finds the terrain cell reached after 11 cardinal moves and retrieves its texture color for rendering effects
- Warehouse order-picking automation that plans the quickest route to an item, identifies the 11th aisle marker on that path, and reads its floor-painting color for location confirmation
- Agricultural field drone flight planning that performs a grid search over crop plots, lands on the 11th block along the optimal route, and reads its soil-moisture color classification
- Urban evacuation route analysis that finds the shortest pedestrian path through a city grid, highlights the 11th block, and inspects its zoning color to assess safety
- Autonomous vehicle test track mapping which computes the fastest route, marks the 11th corner coordinate on that lap, and fetches its pavement-paint color for sensor calibration
- Museum wayfinding application that plots the shortest corridor path from entrance to exhibit, reaches the 11th room, and retrieves its display-wall color for touchscreen feedback
- Pipeline inspection scheduling that models the connectivity graph of segments, navigates to the 11th node on the maintenance route, and checks its material-coating color code for repair prioritization

### Development Step 16: Report START’s Two-Cell Neighbors: Text and Hex Fill from grid_data.json

**Use Cases**:
- Board game engine debugging for chess variants, verifying two-square knight jumps from the START cell using grid metadata to ensure legal move generation.
- Warehouse automation path validation, checking two-cell aisle shifts for automated guided vehicles (AGVs) by inspecting corridor cell labels and status colors in the grid JSON.
- Robotics navigation waypoint planning, confirming two-step moves around obstacles by reading cell occupancy text and obstacle-color codes to validate safe robot turns.
- Traffic signal timing simulation, examining second-neighbor intersections’ signal state text and hex-colors to plan coordinated green waves on a city grid.
- GIS road network analysis, identifying two-road-segment detours by extracting road names and surface-quality color codes from grid data for urban planning reports.
- 2D puzzle game level verification, inspecting two-cell tile neighbors’ types and highlight colors to enforce tile-placement rules during level design.
- Educational tool for teaching matrix operations, retrieving adjacent cell values and background hues to illustrate two-cell shifts and transformations in classroom demos.

### Development Step 7: Two-Step Move Graph BFS from Start to End to Extract 11th Move Cell’s Hex Color

**Description**: Construct adjacency graph of legal two-cell moves using workspace/grid_data.json and workspace/start_end_coordinates.json and perform a breadth-first search from the START cell to locate the shortest path to the END cell enforcing no immediate backtracking; identify the coordinate of the cell landed on after the 11th move along the resulting path; extract that cell’s 6-digit hex fill color from workspace/grid_data.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Warehouse AGV path optimization: plan two-cell hops along green-marked lanes to shuttle pallets, then read the 11th stop’s zone color to schedule a battery swap.
- Hospital autonomous wheelchair routing: traverse color-coded floor tiles with two-step moves, avoiding backtracking, and extract the 11th tile’s hex code to verify it’s a clean-zone surface.
- Firefighter VR training course layout: compute two-cell jumps through safe corridors in a building grid, then use the 11th move’s cell color to trigger a smoke-release simulation.
- Precision-agriculture drone flight planning: map 2×2-meter sampling jumps over healthy-crop plots, retrieve the 11th sampling block’s fill color for nutrient analysis alerts.
- Oil-refinery inspection robot routing: execute two-panel climbs on color-coded walkways, enforce no immediate backstep to maintain safety, and record the 11th panel’s coating color for corrosion monitoring.
- Mobile puzzle-game AI solver: calculate knight-style jumps on a hex-colored board, avoid undoing moves, and capture the 11th tile’s hex color to unlock a bonus level.
- Museum guide robot scheduling: navigate two-step visitor routes across exhibit tiles, then read the 11th tile’s hex color to display the corresponding artwork description.

### Development Step 12: Find 11th-move cell and its hex color via BFS on legal two-cell move graph

**Description**: Construct adjacency graph of legal two-cell moves using workspace/grid_data.json and workspace/start_end_coordinates.json and perform a breadth-first search from the START cell to locate the shortest path to the END cell enforcing no immediate backtracking; identify the coordinate of the cell landed on after the 11th move along the resulting path; extract that cell’s 6-digit hex fill color from workspace/grid_data.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Warehouse AGV route optimization and floor‐marker color verification for industrial logistics
- Autonomous indoor drone waypoint planning and floor‐marker localization for smart warehousing
- Tile-based game level path validation and timed event trigger placement for puzzle video games
- PCB assembly head movement planning and solder-mask inspection at specific placement steps for electronics manufacturing
- Greenhouse robot navigation and soil-moisture sensor sampling after fixed moves for precision agriculture
- Educational STEM tool for knight-move puzzle solving with stepwise feedback in classroom learning
- Digital pathology slide scanning path planning and stain-color sampling at a critical step for medical research analysis
