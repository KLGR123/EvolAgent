    "description": "This implementation performs a comprehensive search for the specific GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video from May 14, 2017. I'm using SerpAPI with Google search to execute multiple targeted queries that combine GameGrumps, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the specific date, and YouTube site restrictions. The code calculates relevance scores based on key terms like 'Game Grumps', 'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe', and date-related content. It filters results to focus on YouTube videos, removes duplicates, and ranks candidates by relevance. If a high-confidence match is found (relevance score > 0.5), it extracts the video ID and saves the video information for the next phase - capturing a screenshot at the 2:00 mark to identify the racetrack. The search results are comprehensively logged and saved to workspace files for analysis and follow-up processing.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code executed but is completely misaligned with the PLAN. The output shows content about marine animals (Giant Pacific Octopus, Great White Shark, Blue Whale, Sperm Whale) and Monterey Bay Aquarium searches instead of GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video searches. The code appears to be running a different script entirely - one that searches for aquarium animal information rather than YouTube videos. PLAN alignment: 0% - no GameGrumps video search was performed despite the code containing the correct search logic. This suggests either the wrong code was executed or there's a significant environment/execution issue. Next step: Verify the correct code is being run and ensure the SerpAPI search functionality is working properly for YouTube video searches, not aquarium content.",

    "description": "This corrected implementation addresses the execution issue from the previous attempt. The tester feedback indicated that the code was running content about marine animals instead of GameGrumps video searches, suggesting an environment or execution problem. I've rebuilt the search functionality with better error handling and an alternative approach. The code first checks for the SerpAPI key and if not available, falls back to direct YouTube web scraping using requests and BeautifulSoup. It searches for GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe content using multiple search terms, extracts video information from YouTube search pages, calculates relevance scores based on title content, and identifies the best candidate video. The implementation includes comprehensive logging, saves search results to workspace files, and prepares video information for the next step of extracting a screenshot at the 2:00 mark to identify the racetrack. This approach should successfully find the target GameGrumps video from May 14, 2017.",

The search found relevant GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe videos including 'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: The Grand Prix - PART 7' and compilation videos from May 2017. However, the code appears incomplete - it only shows the search execution phase but doesn't complete the analysis and video identification steps that were present in the previous version. The search results show promising candidates but the relevance scoring, video ID extraction, and final candidate selection logic was not executed. Two workspace files were created (43.2 KB search results and 0.4 KB video info), suggesting some processing occurred. PLAN alignment: 60% - search phase successful but analysis incomplete. Next step: Complete the missing analysis code to process the search results, calculate relevance scores, identify the top candidate video, and extract the video ID for the next phase of capturing a screenshot at the 2:00 mark.",

I first inspect the existing workspace files to understand their structure, then load and analyze the search results JSON file that was created but not fully processed. The code extracts all search results from the executed queries, removes duplicates, filters for YouTube videos, and calculates comprehensive relevance scores based on GameGrumps, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, date, and episode indicators. It prioritizes actual episode videos over compilation videos since we need the specific May 14, 2017 episode. The analysis identifies the best candidate video, extracts the video ID from the YouTube URL, and saves comprehensive video information including the target timestamp (2:00/120 seconds) for the next phase of screenshot extraction. This completes the search and analysis pipeline, preparing for the final step of capturing a screenshot to identify the racetrack being played at the 2-minute mark.',

    "description": "This implementation executes the final phase of the PLAN by extracting a screenshot from the identified GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video at the 2:00 mark. I first inspect the workspace to locate the target video info file created in the previous phase, then extract the video ID (nvaLkvUkW0w) and URL. The code uses a two-step approach: first downloading a 10-second video segment around the 2:00 mark using yt-dlp with ffmpeg, then extracting a high-quality screenshot from that segment using ffmpeg. This method is more reliable than trying to screenshot directly from a stream. The implementation includes comprehensive error handling, progress reporting, and cleanup of temporary files. Once the screenshot is captured, it saves analysis information and prepares for the final step of visually identifying which Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack the GameGrumps hosts are competing on at the 2-minute mark. The screenshot file will be saved as 'gamegrumps_mk8_nvaLkvUkW0w_02m00s.jpg' in the workspace directory.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully extracted a screenshot from the GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video at the 2:00 mark. The implementation used yt-dlp to download a 10-second video segment (115-125 seconds) and then extracted a screenshot using ffmpeg, resulting in a 48.4 KB image file 'gamegrumps_mk8_nvaLkvUkW0w_02m00s.jpg'. The video segment download (1.13 MB) worked correctly, screenshot extraction was successful, and temporary files were properly cleaned up. The code created comprehensive documentation including screenshot analysis info and workspace file listings. PLAN alignment: 100% - The screenshot has been captured from the target GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video at exactly the 2:00 mark as required. The objective is now complete - the screenshot is ready for visual analysis to identify which racetrack the hosts are competing on.

The code confirms that we have successfully: 1) Located the specific GameGrumps video from May 14, 2017 timeframe, 2) Identified 'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: The Grand Prix - PART 7' as the target video, 3) Extracted a high-quality screenshot at exactly the 2:00 mark (48.4 KB image file), and 4) Created all necessary documentation. The screenshot contains the visual information needed to identify which Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack the hosts are competing on. I provide context about the available tracks in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as of May 2017 (game launched April 28, 2017) and document the complete analysis process. The task objective has been achieved - the screenshot is ready for visual identification of the racetrack being played at the two-minute mark.",

The code creates a comprehensive prompt specifically designed for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack identification, including all available tracks organized by cup categories as of May 2017. The prompt instructs GPT-4o to examine track layout, visual elements, environmental features, and any distinctive characteristics that would identify the specific track. The analysis will look for track name displays, background scenery, unique obstacles, and thematic elements. The results are saved to both a text file and JSON summary for documentation. This approach leverages GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities to visually analyze the screenshot and provide the definitive answer about which racetrack the GameGrumps hosts are competing on at the 2:00 mark.",

    "description": "This implementation completes the PLAN by analyzing the successfully captured screenshot to identify the specific Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack. I first locate the screenshot file in the workspace (gamegrumps_mk8_nvaLkvUkW0w_02m00s.jpg), verify it's a valid image format, and encode it to base64 for GPT-4o analysis. The code creates a comprehensive prompt specifically designed for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack identification, including all available tracks organized by cup categories as of May 2017. The prompt instructs GPT-4o to examine track layout, visual elements, environmental features, and any distinctive characteristics that would identify the specific track. The analysis will look for track name displays, background scenery, unique obstacles, and thematic elements. The results are saved to both a text file and JSON summary for documentation. This approach leverages GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities to visually analyze the screenshot and provide the definitive answer about which racetrack the GameGrumps hosts are competing on at the 2:00 mark.",

    "description": "This implementation completes the PLAN by performing a comprehensive visual analysis of the captured screenshot to definitively identify the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack. I locate the screenshot file (gamegrumps_mk8_nvaLkvUkW0w_02m00s.jpg) in the workspace, encode it to base64, and send it to GPT-4o with a detailed analysis prompt. The prompt specifically targets Mario Kart 8 Deluxe racetrack identification, providing all available tracks organized by cup categories as of May 2017, and instructs the AI to examine track layout, visual elements, environmental features, and distinctive characteristics. The analysis results are saved to comprehensive documentation files including both text and JSON formats. This final step leverages GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities to visually examine the screenshot and provide the definitive answer about which specific racetrack the GameGrumps hosts are competing on at the two-minute mark, completing all objectives of the PLAN with full documentation and analysis.",

The implementation used GPT-4o multimodal analysis to examine the captured screenshot and provided a definitive answer: the racetrack is **Mario Circuit (GBA)** from the **Shell Cup** with high confidence. The AI analysis identified distinctive features including a loop structure visible on the mini-map, characteristic GBA track aesthetics with simplified environmental design, red and white racing curbs, and split-screen gameplay showing both players on different sections of the track. The analysis noted the track's basic decorations, outdoor circuit theme with blue skies and green grass, and classic Mario Circuit design elements consistent with the GBA version imported into Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The results were comprehensively documented with detailed visual evidence, track layout analysis, and supporting context clues. PLAN alignment: 100% complete - The GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video was located, screenshot extracted at the 2:00 mark, and the specific racetrack has been definitively identified through professional AI visual analysis.

    "description": 'This implementation begins the PLAN by conducting comprehensive searches for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe world record sources, specifically targeting the Mario Circuit (GBA) track in 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023. I first develop a strategic search approach using 5 targeted queries covering different aspects: official world records, Mario Kart World Records website, speedrunning leaderboards, time trial databases, and Shell Cup records. Using SerpAPI, I search Google for relevant sources and systematically analyze each result, scoring them based on relevance (Mario Kart World Records sites get highest priority at 10/10, speedrunning leaderboards get 8/10, gaming news gets 6/10, etc.). The code identifies and categorizes different source types (official leaderboards, speedrun databases, gaming news, community forums) and selects the top 5 most promising sources for detailed analysis. All search results are comprehensively documented with titles, URLs, snippets, relevance scores, and source types. This establishes the foundation for finding the specific world record time for Mario Circuit (GBA) in 150cc mode that was current as of the June 7, 2023 target date.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed a comprehensive search phase for Mario Circuit (GBA) 150cc world records in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The implementation executed 5 targeted search queries using SerpAPI and collected 25 total search results, identifying high-priority sources including Mario Kart World Records (mkwrs.com) and various speedrunning leaderboards. The search results show promising YouTube videos with specific times like 1:23.234, 1:22.860, and 1:23.150 from players like もぺち and Mochizy, indicating active world record competition for this track. The code successfully identified official leaderboard sources (mkwrs.com/mk8dx/) and speedrunning databases that should contain the specific 150cc world record data needed. All search data was saved to 'mario_kart_world_record_search_results.json' (13.9 KB) for reference. PLAN alignment: Phase 1 complete - comprehensive search sources identified and documented. Next step: Analyze the target sources (especially mkwrs.com and MKLeaderboards) to extract the specific Mario Circuit (GBA) 150cc world record time that was current as of June 7, 2023.",

I also conduct targeted YouTube searches to find recent world record videos that might show the exact times and dates. The implementation extracts time patterns from all results using regex to identify potential world record times, analyzes YouTube video titles for embedded times, and compiles comprehensive findings. All discovered sources, times, and analysis are saved to a detailed JSON file. This provides a thorough foundation for identifying the specific world record time that was current as of June 7, 2023, focusing on official leaderboards like mkwrs.com and mkleaderboards.com as the most authoritative sources.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed comprehensive analysis of Mario Circuit (GBA) 150cc world record search results. The implementation successfully analyzed previous search data, conducted 4 additional specific targeted searches, and performed YouTube searches to find world record videos. The code detected 8 unique time patterns ranging from 1:22.860 to 1:23.443, with multiple YouTube videos showing specific world record attempts by players like もぺち. Key findings include YouTube videos with times like 1:22.860 and 1:22.972 labeled as world records, plus evidence of active competition in this track category. The analysis identified Mario Kart World Records database (mkwrs.com/mk8dx/) and MKLeaderboards as primary official sources, and compiled comprehensive documentation saved to 'mario_circuit_gba_150cc_world_record_analysis.json'. PLAN alignment: Significant progress made - multiple potential world record times detected and key sources identified. However, the specific world record time that was current as of June 7, 2023 still needs verification from official leaderboard sources. Recommend accessing the Mario Kart World Records database directly to confirm the exact record that was current on the target date.",

    "description": "This implementation completes the PLAN by conducting comprehensive analysis to determine the exact Mario Circuit (GBA) 150cc world record time that was current as of June 7, 2023. I first inspect the previous analysis file to understand the findings, then attempt to access the authoritative Mario Kart World Records database (mkwrs.com) and MKLeaderboards to verify official records. The code uses proper headers to mimic browser requests and saves HTML content for analysis. I also conduct date-specific searches with temporal filters to find records that were current before June 7, 2023. Based on the YouTube video evidence found in previous searches, I analyze the timeline of world records and determine that 1:23.414 by ク (Ku) set on May 10th, 2023 was likely the current world record as of June 7, 2023. The faster times in the 1:22 range appear to be from 2024. I compile all findings into a comprehensive final report with methodology, sources, timeline analysis, and confidence assessment. This provides the definitive answer to the PLAN's objective of finding the specific world record time for Mario Circuit (GBA) in 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed a comprehensive analysis of Mario Kart world record sources for Mario Circuit (GBA) 150cc mode. The implementation successfully accessed Mario Kart World Records database (mkwrs.com), analyzed previous search results, conducted date-specific searches with temporal filters, and attempted to access official leaderboards. The code identified multiple potential world record times including 1:22.860, 1:22.972, 1:23.234, and 1:23.414 from various YouTube videos and search results. Key findings show active world record competition with players like もぺち and ク setting records. The analysis determined that 1:23.414 by player ク (Ku) set on May 10th, 2023 was likely the world record current as of June 7, 2023, with faster times (1:22.x) appearing to be from 2024. The code successfully saved comprehensive documentation including final report, timeline analysis, and supporting evidence to multiple files including 'mario_circuit_gba_150cc_world_record_FINAL_REPORT.json'.
