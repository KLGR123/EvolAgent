# Developer Plan 04

## Plan
Research the October 1949 breakfast menu for the SS Île de France ocean liner. Search for historical shipping company records, passenger testimonials, maritime archives, vintage cruise brochures, and dining service documentation from the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (French Line) that would contain specific breakfast menu items served aboard the Île de France during October 1949. Focus on finding official menus, passenger accounts, or maritime dining records that list the specific fruits served during breakfast service on this vessel during that time period.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified all fruits in Janet Fish's 2008 painting 'Embroidery from Uzbekistan' (oranges, lemons, peaches, pears, bananas, melons, watermelons), (2) We have definitively identified the SS Île de France as the ocean liner used as a floating prop in 'The Last Voyage' film, (3) Now we need to research the specific breakfast menu items served on the Île de France in October 1949 to determine which fruits from the painting were actually served on the ship, (4) This final research phase will allow us to cross-reference the painting's fruits with the historical breakfast offerings and provide the definitive answer to the multi-component task

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Identify Postmaster General Who Introduced Scheduled Mail on Turnpike Roads

**Description**: Research the history of postal systems to identify the person who served as Postmaster General and introduced a postal system that first implemented scheduled delivery times and operated on turnpike roads. Focus on early postal system developments, particularly in countries known for pioneering organized mail delivery systems such as Britain, France, or early American postal services. Search for keywords including 'first scheduled postal delivery', 'turnpike road postal system', 'Postmaster General scheduled delivery times', and 'early postal system turnpike roads'.

**Use Cases**:
- Automating archival research for university historians studying 18th-century postal reforms and mail coach innovations
- Curating interactive museum exhibits on the first scheduled mail delivery system using data-driven timelines and biographies
- Assisting genealogists in tracing ancestors who worked under Postmaster General Lord Sandwich or in Palmer’s mail coach network
- Generating educational modules and quizzes for digital history courses on early communication infrastructure in Britain and America
- Benchmarking modern courier startup route optimizations against 1784 London-Bath mail coach schedules to improve delivery reliability
- Streamlining national library digitization projects by extracting and summarizing key figures and events from postal system archives
- Supporting documentary filmmakers with quick API-based retrieval of primary sources and contextual analysis for segments on Benjamin Franklin and John Palmer
- Building lesson plans for secondary school history teachers that integrate code-generated visual timelines of postal milestones and turnpike road developments

### Development Step 7: Identify Berlin Football Club Winning 1984 DDR-Pokal and Its October 2, 1985 European Match

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the Berlin-based football club that won the last East German Cup in 1984. Search for keywords including 'East German Cup 1984 winner Berlin football club', 'DDR-Pokal 1984 final Berlin team', 'last East German Cup 1984 champion', and 'GDR Cup 1984 Berlin football'. Focus on identifying which Berlin club won this final East German Cup tournament and gather information about their European competition participation in the 1985-86 season, particularly any matches on 2 October 1985.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports historians automating the retrieval of archived match reports and statistics for museum exhibitions on East German football
- Investigative sports journalists verifying specific game dates, opponents, and venues to fact-check feature articles on BFC Dynamo’s European campaigns
- Football fan sites populating their club history pages with accurate details from the 1985-86 UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup using targeted web searches
- Documentary researchers compiling precise timelines and contextual snippets for a film on DDR-era football through multi-query API extraction
- Academic sports scientists aggregating performance data of East German clubs in European competitions for statistical trend analysis
- Data engineers building a structured historical sports database by systematically querying and filtering online sources for exact match information
- Educators designing interactive quizzes and lesson plans on German football history, automatically sourcing validated match outcomes and dates
- Mobile app developers integrating a dynamic timeline feature that auto-loads historical match events (e.g., 2 October 1985) for fan engagement tools

### Development Step 2: Seahorse Island Full-House Rentals With Swimming Amenities, Family-Friendly Features, and Availability Status

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/366e2f2b-8632-4ef2-81eb-bc3877489217.pdf to extract information about all accommodations in Seahorse Island. Focus on identifying properties that offer full house rentals and have swimming amenities (pools, beach access, or water features). Extract details including accommodation names, property types, amenities, availability status, and any family-friendly features to enable comparison of options suitable for a family seeking a full house with swimming facilities.

**Use Cases**:
- Travel agency itinerary automation by parsing PDF catalogs of Seahorse Island lodgings to curate full-house rentals with pools and beach access for family vacation packages
- Vacation rental aggregator platform extracting detailed amenities and availability from island property PDF reports to dynamically update swim-friendly listings for parents planning trips
- Real estate investment analysis tool processing PDF accommodation data to evaluate full-house rentals with water features for ROI projections and portfolio diversification
- Local tourism board content management system summarizing PDF accommodation brochures to highlight family-oriented swim-enabled properties on official island visitor websites
- Property management CRM integration that ingests PDF booking and amenity details to automatically recommend available family-friendly houses with pools to repeat guests
- Hospitality market research solution scanning competitor PDF listings to identify gaps in full-house swim amenity offerings on Seahorse Island for strategic service expansion
- Insurance underwriting pre-screening process parsing PDF descriptions of rental houses with water features to assess property risk and streamline quote generation for seasonal policies

### Development Step 4: Comprehensive List of Fiona Apple and Paula Cole Albums (Pre-1999) with Exact Release Dates

**Description**: Research and compile a comprehensive list of all albums released by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole before 1999, including their exact release dates and album titles. Focus on their studio albums, EPs, and any other significant releases during this timeframe. Use multiple music databases, discographies, and reliable sources to ensure completeness.

**Use Cases**:
- Music streaming service metadata enrichment and timeline visualization for pre-1999 Fiona Apple and Paula Cole releases
- Vinyl collector platform verification and pricing automation using exact album release dates and formats
- Music journalism research and fact-checking for a retrospective feature on 1990s female singer-songwriters
- Academic study on gender representation in 1990s pop music, analyzing release frequency and career progression
- Radio station programming automation to schedule anniversary specials in correct chronological order
- E-commerce music store catalog population and SEO optimization with precise release dates and album titles
- Music licensing department compliance check to confirm rights windows for pre-1999 recordings
- Mobile app development for discography enthusiasts offering complete 1990s album timelines and release details
