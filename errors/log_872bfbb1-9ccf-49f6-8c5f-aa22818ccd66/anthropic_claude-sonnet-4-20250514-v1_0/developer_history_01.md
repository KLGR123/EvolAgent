    "description": "Initial comprehensive search for the 2008 painting 'Embroidery from Uzbekistan' using multiple search strategies. This implementation conducts systematic Google searches with 6 different query variations targeting: (1) Artist identification, (2) Museum collections, (3) Content descriptions, (4) Auction records, (5) Gallery exhibitions, and (6) Scholarly sources. The code includes robust error handling, rate limiting, and comprehensive result analysis with key indicator detection for museum sources, auction records, visual representations, and artist information. All search results are saved to workspace/embroidery_uzbekistan_search_results.json for detailed analysis. If SerpAPI is unavailable, the code falls back to direct art database access attempts. This establishes the foundation for identifying the artist, verifying the painting's existence, and locating visual representations or detailed descriptions of the depicted fruits.",

The search identified the artist as Janet Fish (American, born 1938) and verified the painting's existence in the Dayton Art Institute collection. Multiple sources confirm 'Embroidery from Uzbekistan' is a 2008 oil on canvas painting (50 x 70 inches) with museum provenance. The code found visual representations through museum sources, YouTube presentations, and Pinterest posts. Key findings include: (1) Artist confirmed as Janet Fish, (2) Painting verified as existing in Dayton Art Institute collection, (3) Multiple visual sources located including museum exhibition pages and video presentations, (4) Content descriptions found mentioning 'firm ripe fruit' and fruit depictions.
