# Developer Plan 04

## Plan
Access and analyze the October 1949 breakfast menu for the SS Île de France from the identified sources, particularly the ggarchives.com page titled 'A 1949 First-Class Breakfast Aboard the SS Ile de France'. Extract all fruit items listed on the breakfast menu and cross-reference them with the fruits identified in Janet Fish's 2008 painting 'Embroidery from Uzbekistan' (watermelon, pears, lemons, bananas). Determine which fruits appear in both the painting and the October 1949 breakfast menu, then arrange the matching fruits in clockwise order starting from 12 o'clock position based on their arrangement in the painting, using plural forms as requested.

## Description
This is the final step needed to complete the task because: (1) We have successfully identified the SS Île de France as the ocean liner used in 'The Last Voyage' and located the specific October 1949 breakfast menu, (2) We have a complete inventory of fruits in the painting with their clockwise positions (12 o'clock: watermelon, 2 o'clock: pears, 4 o'clock: lemons, 7 o'clock: bananas), (3) Expected outcome is to extract the fruit items from the breakfast menu and determine which ones match the painting's fruits, then provide the final answer in the requested clockwise order using plural forms, (4) This directly completes the complex multi-part research task by connecting the painting's contents with the historical breakfast menu

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Ice Cream Product Image Analysis: Extract Brand, Name, Nutrition, Ingredients, Serving Size, Butterfat Content

**Description**: Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/b2c257e0-3ad7-4f05-b8e3-d9da973be36e.jpg to identify and extract information about the ice cream product, including any visible nutrition labels, ingredient lists, or butterfat content specifications. Look for product name, brand, serving size, and any fat content information that might be displayed on the packaging.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated quality assurance for food manufacturers to verify that ice cream packaging displays accurate nutrition and ingredient information before products are shipped to retailers
- Regulatory compliance checks for food safety inspectors who need to confirm that butterfat content and labeling meet legal standards by analyzing product images from factory floors
- Retail inventory digitization for grocery chains, enabling staff to quickly extract and catalog detailed product specs (brand, flavor, nutrition) from shelf images for online store listings
- Consumer health app integration, allowing users to scan ice cream packaging and receive instant, detailed breakdowns of nutrition facts and ingredients for dietary tracking
- Competitive product benchmarking for market analysts comparing fat content, ingredients, and nutritional claims across multiple ice cream brands using shelf or marketing images
- Automated product recall identification, where food safety teams analyze packaging images to detect specific batch numbers, allergens, or ingredient changes in response to recalls
- Academic research in food science, enabling researchers to collect and analyze large datasets of ingredient lists and nutritional profiles from diverse ice cream products for trend analysis
- Visual merchandising audits for brand managers, who use extracted label data from in-store photos to verify correct product placement, branding, and compliance with promotional standards

### Development Step 2: Extract and Categorize Fast-Food Menu Sales from Excel, Prepare Food-Only Sales Totals

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/7bd855d8-463d-4ed5-93ca-5fe35145f733.xlsx to extract all sales data for the fast-food chain menu items. Identify the structure of the spreadsheet including column headers, data organization, and categorize menu items to distinguish between food items and drinks. Extract sales figures for each item and prepare the data for calculating total food sales excluding beverages.

**Use Cases**:
- Multi-location franchise performance benchmarking: aggregate and compare food vs beverage sales across outlets to identify top-performing restaurants and underperforming regions
- Inventory procurement optimization for supply chain teams: parse POS export spreadsheets to compute accurate demand for burgers, salads, fries, etc., excluding beverages to streamline restocking orders
- Financial auditing and compliance reporting for hospitality accountants: automatically extract and categorize sales figures from daily sales logs to generate audit trails and tax reports focusing on taxable food items
- Menu engineering and dynamic pricing analysis for marketing managers: analyze historical sales volume per menu category to adjust pricing, promotions, and product placement for maximizing food item revenue excluding drinks
- Demand forecasting and supply planning for operations teams: ingest weekly Excel sales exports, aggregate item-level food sales excluding beverages, and feed into forecasting models for ingredient ordering
- Loyalty program ROI assessment for CRM platforms: extract item-level sales data by location to measure uplift in food purchases during targeted promotions or discount campaigns, excluding beverage sales
- Business intelligence dashboard integration for executive reporting: transform raw Excel sales data into structured JSON and text summaries for real-time ingestion into BI tools to visualize food-only revenue trends across all outlets
- Competitive benchmarking and market analysis for consultancy firms: use categorized sales data to compare menu performance against industry benchmarks and advise clients on menu mix optimization

### Development Step 7: Pre-1999 Fiona Apple & Paula Cole Album Release List with Exact Dates

**Description**: Research and compile a comprehensive list of all albums released by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole before 1999, including their exact release dates and album titles. Focus on their studio albums, EPs, and any other significant releases during this timeframe. Use multiple music databases, discographies, and reliable sources to ensure completeness.

**Use Cases**:
- Curating a detailed ‘90s Female Singer-Songwriters Spotlight’ for a music blog, ensuring all Fiona Apple and Paula Cole studio albums and EPs are accurately dated and titled
- Populating a digital music archive’s metadata system with pre-1999 release records to support library cataloging and provenance tracking
- Automating the creation of a streaming service’s themed playlist (“90s Singer-Songwriter Essentials”) by extracting album titles and release years for content tagging
- Supporting academic musicology research on late-90s album production trends by compiling precise discography data for comparative analysis
- Preparing a record label’s anniversary reissue campaign by generating a verified timeline of original release dates and album formats for marketing collateral
- Enhancing a fan-community website’s discography section with an up-to-date, machine-extracted list of early Fiona Apple and Paula Cole releases, complete with confidence indicators
- Feeding a music data‐analysis tool with structured pre-1999 release information to drive visualization dashboards on artist output over time

### Development Step 1: Family Reunion Attendance Analysis and Potato Needs in 5-Pound Bags

**Description**: Systematically analyze the family reunion attendee list to determine the exact number of adults and children attending. Parse through each family group mentioned: (1) Your parents (married mother and father), (2) Your twin brother and his family (brother + spouse + 2 children), (3) Your aunt and her family (aunt + spouse + 1 six-year-old), (4) Your grandma and her brother, (5) Her brother's daughter and her family (daughter + spouse + 3 kids under 12), plus yourself. Account for the deceased members (grandpa and grandma's sister-in-law) and the special dietary restriction (second cousins don't eat carbs). Calculate total potato consumption using the given rates: 1.5 potatoes per adult, 0.5 potatoes per child (except carb-free second cousins), convert to pounds using 0.5 pounds per potato, and determine how many 5-pound bags are needed.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate retreat catering and side-dish provisioning for a multinational team with low-carb and child-friendly meal options
- Summer camp weekly meal planning and potato supply calculation for campers, counselors, and gluten-free participants
- Wedding reception menu and ingredient ordering automation accounting for adults, children, and guests with dietary restrictions
- School field trip lunch box assembly and snack pack distribution for students with allergen exclusions and teacher chaperones
- Hospital inpatient meal scheduling and tuber-based side dish forecasting across adult and pediatric wards with diabetic diet exclusions
- Military training camp mess hall resource forecasting and bulk potato ordering considering soldiers and trainees on low‐carb rations
- Non-profit community soup kitchen stock planning and vegetable procurement tailored to adult visitors, families, and carb-free volunteers
- Restaurant chain brunch service potato side dish inventory management and automated ordering report generation for multiple locations
