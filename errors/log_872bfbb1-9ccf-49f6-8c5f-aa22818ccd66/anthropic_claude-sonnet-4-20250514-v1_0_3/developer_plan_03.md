# Developer Plan 03

## Plan
Analyze the October 1949 SS Île de France breakfast menu from workspace/ile_de_france_menu_search_results.json to extract all fruit items served, then cross-reference these with the fruits identified in the 2008 painting 'Embroidery from Uzbekistan' (bananas, watermelon, lemons, pears) to determine which painting fruits appeared on the breakfast menu. For any matching fruits, arrange them in clockwise order based on their positions in the painting starting from 12 o'clock and convert to plural form as requested.

## Description
This is the final step to complete the task because: (1) We have successfully identified all fruits in the 2008 painting with their clockwise positions documented, (2) We have located the specific ocean liner (SS Île de France) used in 'The Last Voyage' and found its October 1949 breakfast menu, (3) Expected outcome is to cross-reference the menu items with painting fruits and produce the final comma-separated list in clockwise order, (4) This directly completes the complex multi-part TASK by connecting all three elements: the painting fruits, the ocean liner breakfast menu, and the film connection.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Ice Cream Product Image Analysis: Extract Brand, Name, Nutrition, Ingredients, Serving Size, Butterfat Content

**Description**: Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/b2c257e0-3ad7-4f05-b8e3-d9da973be36e.jpg to identify and extract information about the ice cream product, including any visible nutrition labels, ingredient lists, or butterfat content specifications. Look for product name, brand, serving size, and any fat content information that might be displayed on the packaging.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated quality assurance for food manufacturers to verify that ice cream packaging displays accurate nutrition and ingredient information before products are shipped to retailers
- Regulatory compliance checks for food safety inspectors who need to confirm that butterfat content and labeling meet legal standards by analyzing product images from factory floors
- Retail inventory digitization for grocery chains, enabling staff to quickly extract and catalog detailed product specs (brand, flavor, nutrition) from shelf images for online store listings
- Consumer health app integration, allowing users to scan ice cream packaging and receive instant, detailed breakdowns of nutrition facts and ingredients for dietary tracking
- Competitive product benchmarking for market analysts comparing fat content, ingredients, and nutritional claims across multiple ice cream brands using shelf or marketing images
- Automated product recall identification, where food safety teams analyze packaging images to detect specific batch numbers, allergens, or ingredient changes in response to recalls
- Academic research in food science, enabling researchers to collect and analyze large datasets of ingredient lists and nutritional profiles from diverse ice cream products for trend analysis
- Visual merchandising audits for brand managers, who use extracted label data from in-store photos to verify correct product placement, branding, and compliance with promotional standards

### Development Step 2: Extract and Categorize Fast-Food Menu Sales from Excel, Prepare Food-Only Sales Totals

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/7bd855d8-463d-4ed5-93ca-5fe35145f733.xlsx to extract all sales data for the fast-food chain menu items. Identify the structure of the spreadsheet including column headers, data organization, and categorize menu items to distinguish between food items and drinks. Extract sales figures for each item and prepare the data for calculating total food sales excluding beverages.

**Use Cases**:
- Multi-location franchise performance benchmarking: aggregate and compare food vs beverage sales across outlets to identify top-performing restaurants and underperforming regions
- Inventory procurement optimization for supply chain teams: parse POS export spreadsheets to compute accurate demand for burgers, salads, fries, etc., excluding beverages to streamline restocking orders
- Financial auditing and compliance reporting for hospitality accountants: automatically extract and categorize sales figures from daily sales logs to generate audit trails and tax reports focusing on taxable food items
- Menu engineering and dynamic pricing analysis for marketing managers: analyze historical sales volume per menu category to adjust pricing, promotions, and product placement for maximizing food item revenue excluding drinks
- Demand forecasting and supply planning for operations teams: ingest weekly Excel sales exports, aggregate item-level food sales excluding beverages, and feed into forecasting models for ingredient ordering
- Loyalty program ROI assessment for CRM platforms: extract item-level sales data by location to measure uplift in food purchases during targeted promotions or discount campaigns, excluding beverage sales
- Business intelligence dashboard integration for executive reporting: transform raw Excel sales data into structured JSON and text summaries for real-time ingestion into BI tools to visualize food-only revenue trends across all outlets
- Competitive benchmarking and market analysis for consultancy firms: use categorized sales data to compare menu performance against industry benchmarks and advise clients on menu mix optimization

### Development Step 1: Family Reunion Attendance Analysis and Potato Needs in 5-Pound Bags

**Description**: Systematically analyze the family reunion attendee list to determine the exact number of adults and children attending. Parse through each family group mentioned: (1) Your parents (married mother and father), (2) Your twin brother and his family (brother + spouse + 2 children), (3) Your aunt and her family (aunt + spouse + 1 six-year-old), (4) Your grandma and her brother, (5) Her brother's daughter and her family (daughter + spouse + 3 kids under 12), plus yourself. Account for the deceased members (grandpa and grandma's sister-in-law) and the special dietary restriction (second cousins don't eat carbs). Calculate total potato consumption using the given rates: 1.5 potatoes per adult, 0.5 potatoes per child (except carb-free second cousins), convert to pounds using 0.5 pounds per potato, and determine how many 5-pound bags are needed.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate retreat catering and side-dish provisioning for a multinational team with low-carb and child-friendly meal options
- Summer camp weekly meal planning and potato supply calculation for campers, counselors, and gluten-free participants
- Wedding reception menu and ingredient ordering automation accounting for adults, children, and guests with dietary restrictions
- School field trip lunch box assembly and snack pack distribution for students with allergen exclusions and teacher chaperones
- Hospital inpatient meal scheduling and tuber-based side dish forecasting across adult and pediatric wards with diabetic diet exclusions
- Military training camp mess hall resource forecasting and bulk potato ordering considering soldiers and trainees on low‐carb rations
- Non-profit community soup kitchen stock planning and vegetable procurement tailored to adult visitors, families, and carb-free volunteers
- Restaurant chain brunch service potato side dish inventory management and automated ordering report generation for multiple locations

### Development Step 1: Parse Excel Fast-Food Sales Data: Identify Structure, Categorize Items, Compute Food Sales

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/7bd855d8-463d-4ed5-93ca-5fe35145f733.xlsx to extract all sales data for the fast-food chain menu items. Identify the structure of the spreadsheet including column headers, data organization, and categorize menu items to distinguish between food items and drinks. Extract sales figures for each item and prepare the data for calculating total food sales excluding beverages.

**Use Cases**:
- Monthly revenue reporting for a fast-food franchise’s finance department, automatically extracting food-only sales figures to reconcile budgets and P&L statements
- Automated inventory reorder triggers in the supply chain system, using daily food item sales volumes (excluding beverages) to forecast stock depletion and place purchase orders
- Regional menu performance benchmarking for corporate strategy teams, comparing unit sales of burgers, fries, and salads across multiple outlets to inform promotional campaigns
- Academic study on consumer eating habits, correlating time-of-day food sales data (excluding drinks) with demographic surveys to publish insights in a nutrition journal
- Point-of-sale system integration that updates digital menu availability and highlights top-selling food items in real time based on parsed Excel sales exports
- Restaurant staff scheduling optimization tool that analyzes peak food-only sales periods to allocate kitchen and counter staff efficiently, reducing labor costs
- Product development research for new menu items, using historical food sales trends (without beverages) to identify gaps in offerings and guide R&D decisions

### Development Step 35: Identify the Notable Artist and Suffragette from Clare, Suffolk

**Description**: Based on the comprehensive research conducted in the HISTORY, identify the specific notable artist and suffragette from Clare, Suffolk. The research has established that Clare, Suffolk is the location that experienced the 17th century arachnid event documented in Irish chronicles alongside spectral army apparitions. Now focus on finding the specific individual who was both a notable artist AND a suffragette from Clare, Suffolk, rather than separate artists and suffragettes from that location.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated archival analysis for digital humanities: ingest structured JSON archives of local history to automatically extract individuals who served as both artists and activists for museum exhibits and publications
- Regional cultural grant assessment: cross-reference art residency applicant databases with suffrage movement registries in JSON format to identify candidates who have contributed to both artistic and social-political causes
- Scholarly fact-checking pipeline: parse JSON-formatted biographical metadata across multiple research papers to detect and reconcile discrepancies in individuals’ artistic and suffragette roles
- Non-profit volunteer management automation: analyze JSON lists of volunteers and program instructors to match participants who are both art educators and civic engagement advocates for tailored outreach
- Genealogy research enhancement: merge JSON-based family tree records with civic involvement logs to uncover ancestors from a specific locale who held dual roles in art and women’s rights movements
- EdTech curriculum development: mine structured historical datasets in JSON to generate interactive learning modules featuring figures who bridged creative arts and political activism
- Targeted cultural heritage marketing: scan JSON archives of local influencers and social movement participants to identify dual-role personalities for focused storytelling in digital campaigns
