  "final_answer": "bananas, pears",
  "reason": "Task decomposition: This complex multi-part question requires (1) identifying fruits in Janet Fish's 2008 painting 'Embroidery from Uzbekistan', (2) determining their clockwise arrangement from 12 o'clock, (3) identifying the ocean liner used as a prop in 'The Last Voyage', (4) locating its October 1949 breakfast menu, and (5) cross-referencing to find overlapping fruits. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 demonstrated exceptional systematic methodology with comprehensive visual analysis identifying 4 fruits (bananas at 12 o'clock, watermelon at top right, pears at right side, lemons at bottom left), correctly identified SS Île de France as the ship, and located the complete October 1949 breakfast menu through GG Archives showing 8 fruits including 'Bananas' and 'Pear'. Their cross-reference analysis was methodologically sound, identifying 2 matches with proper singular/plural handling. Member 2 showed strong research capabilities, correctly identifying the same 4 fruits with slightly different positioning (bananas at 10 o'clock, watermelon at 2 o'clock, pears at 4 o'clock, lemons at 7 o'clock), confirmed SS Île de France identification, and reached identical conclusion of 2 matching fruits (bananas, pears). Member 3 demonstrated thorough ship identification and menu location but concluded incorrectly that no fruits matched, apparently missing the fruit content in the breakfast menu despite locating the correct source. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on both fruit identification and final answer, while Member 3's analysis contained a critical gap in menu content extraction. Integration assessment: Members 1 and 2's methodologies are complementary and mutually validating, with Member 1 providing slightly more systematic documentation. Final validation confirms 'bananas, pears' as the definitive answer based on verified menu content from GG Archives showing these fruits were served aboard SS Île de France in October 1949.",
