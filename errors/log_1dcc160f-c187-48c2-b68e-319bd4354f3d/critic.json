  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine the count of NeurIPS 2022 papers by authors named Yuri that received 'certain' recommendations on OpenReview.net, requiring systematic search and verification of recommendation terminology. Member 0 conducted comprehensive API search identifying 1 paper by Yuri Fonseca and Yuri Saporito, thoroughly analyzed all review notes and meta-reviews, but found no 'certain' recommendation status as this terminology doesn't exist in NeurIPS 2022's review system - methodologically rigorous with proper API usage and systematic verification. Member 1 claimed to find 2 papers with 'certain' recommendations but provided contradictory evidence showing standard 'Accept' decisions rather than 'certain' status, demonstrating fundamental misunderstanding of recommendation terminology and conflating confidence levels with recommendation categories. Member 2 found 1 different paper by Yuri A. Lawryshyn but could not access review data due to privacy restrictions, concluding 0 papers with 'certain' recommendations - showed good search methodology but limited data access. Cross-analysis reveals critical divergence: Member 1's claim of finding 'certain' recommendations contradicts the evidence provided and misinterprets standard review terminology. Convergence between Members 0 and 2 on final answer of 0, with Member 0 providing definitive evidence that 'certain' is not a recommendation category used by NeurIPS 2022. Integration assessment: Member 0's systematic approach with complete API access and thorough terminology verification provides most reliable foundation. Final validation confirms 0 as correct answer since 'certain' recommendation status does not exist in NeurIPS 2022 review system.",
