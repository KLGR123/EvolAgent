    "description": "Starting comprehensive search of OpenReview.net for NeurIPS 2022 papers by authors named Yuri. This initial implementation explores the OpenReview API structure, attempts multiple search strategies to find NeurIPS 2022 papers, and systematically searches through author information to identify papers where an author's first name is 'Yuri'. The approach includes: (1) Testing different OpenReview API invitation patterns for NeurIPS 2022, (2) Inspecting paper structure to understand how author information is stored, (3) Implementing flexible author name matching to catch variations of 'Yuri', (4) Saving intermediate results for further analysis of acceptance status and recommendations. This establishes the foundation for extracting detailed acceptance and recommendation information in subsequent steps.",

The search functionality worked well and results were saved to 'workspace/openreview_neurips2022_yuri_authors.json'. However, the **PLAN** requires extracting acceptance status and recommendation details, especially 'certain' recommendations, which was not completed. The code identified this as a next step but didn't implement it. **PLAN** alignment: 60% complete. Next steps: (1) Extract acceptance/rejection status for the 2 found papers, (2) Look for review data and recommendation details using the paper IDs (09QFnDWPF8, Uynr3iPhksa), (3) Search specifically for 'certain' recommendation status in the review data.",

    "description": 'Building on the previous search that found 2 papers with Yuri authors, this implementation extracts detailed acceptance status and recommendation information for each paper. The approach: (1) Loads the previously saved Yuri papers data and inspects its structure, (2) Uses OpenReview API to fetch all notes/reviews for each paper using the forum ID, (3) Systematically categorizes notes into decisions, reviews, and meta-reviews based on invitation patterns, (4) Extracts acceptance status from decision notes, (5) Analyzes review content for recommendations and confidence levels, (6) Specifically searches for "certain" recommendations in both recommendation text and confidence fields, (7) Compiles comprehensive status information including acceptance decisions, review counts, and recommendation details, (8) Saves detailed results to workspace and provides clear summary statistics. This completes the PLAN requirements by identifying acceptance status and highlighting any papers with "certain" recommendation status.',
