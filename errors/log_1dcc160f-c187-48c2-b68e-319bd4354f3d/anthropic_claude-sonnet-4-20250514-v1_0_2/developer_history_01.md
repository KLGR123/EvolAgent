    "description": "Implementation of OpenReview.net search for NeurIPS 2022 papers by authors named 'Yuri'. This code: (1) Uses the OpenReview API to search for NeurIPS 2022 conference submissions, (2) Filters papers by author names containing 'Yuri' (case-insensitive), (3) Extracts detailed paper information including titles, all authors, and matching Yuri authors, (4) Attempts to retrieve acceptance status and recommendation details by querying for decisions and official reviews, (5) Saves comprehensive results to workspace/openreview_neurips_2022_yuri_papers.json for further analysis. The approach starts by examining the first 50 papers to understand the data structure and identify any papers with Yuri authors, then extracts recommendation details including decision status and reviewer confidence levels. The code includes extensive logging and error handling to ensure robust execution and clear progress reporting.",

The API connection worked and paper filtering logic is correct. However, the code only examined 50 out of 1000 available papers, potentially missing other Yuri-authored papers. More critically, Step 3 (extracting acceptance status and recommendations) appears to have started but produced no output - no decision or review information was displayed for the found paper. The PLAN requires finding papers with 'certain' recommendation status, but no recommendation details were extracted. Next steps: (1) Expand search to examine all 1000 papers instead of just 50, (2) Debug the decision/review extraction logic to actually retrieve and display acceptance status and recommendation details, (3) Specifically look for 'certain' recommendation status as required by the PLAN.",

This enhanced version: (1) Expands the search from 50 to all 1000 available papers to ensure no Yuri-authored papers are missed, (2) Implements robust decision and review information extraction with proper error handling and API status checking, (3) Specifically searches for 'certain' recommendation status as required by the PLAN, (4) Provides detailed logging of each paper's analysis including decision text, recommendation details, and confidence levels, (5) Creates comprehensive results with acceptance status breakdown and saves to workspace/openreview_neurips_2022_yuri_papers_comprehensive.json. The code addresses the previous issues by actually executing the decision/review extraction logic and displaying the results, while being respectful to the OpenReview API with appropriate delays between requests.",

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed successfully and made significant improvements by examining all 1000 NeurIPS 2022 papers instead of just 50, finding 2 papers with 'Yuri' authors (up from 1 in previous search). The comprehensive search successfully identified: (1) 'Statistical Learning and Inverse Problems: A Stochastic Gradient Approach' by Yuri Fonseca and Yuri Saporito, and (2) 'Recurrent Memory Transformer' by Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, and Mikhail Burtsev. However, the critical issue remains unresolved - all API calls for decision and review information returned 400 errors, preventing extraction of acceptance status and recommendation details. The PLAN specifically requires finding papers with 'certain' recommendation status, but zero recommendation details were retrieved for either paper. The comprehensive results file was saved successfully, but contains no decision or review data. Next steps: (1) Debug the decision/review API parameters - the 400 errors suggest incorrect invitation patterns or missing required parameters, (2) Try alternative API endpoints or invitation formats for accessing NeurIPS 2022 decisions and reviews, (3) Research the correct OpenReview API structure for retrieving post-review decision data for NeurIPS 2022 papers.",

This code: (1) Inspects the comprehensive results file to understand the current state and available Yuri papers, (2) Queries the OpenReview invitations API to discover all available NeurIPS 2022 invitation patterns, (3) Identifies decision-related and review-related invitations from the discovered patterns, (4) Tests multiple invitation patterns systematically using a known Yuri paper as a test case, (5) Evaluates both common OpenReview patterns and discovered invitations to find working API endpoints, (6) Reports successful patterns that return actual decision/review data with content analysis, (7) Saves successful patterns to workspace/successful_api_patterns.json for use in final data extraction. This systematic approach should identify the correct API endpoints needed to retrieve acceptance status and recommendation details, specifically looking for 'certain' recommendation status as required by the PLAN.",

The investigation successfully: (1) Discovered the correct NeurIPS 2022 invitation patterns by querying the invitations endpoint, finding 100 total invitations including 4 decision-related ones like 'NeurIPS.cc/2022/Conference/-/Decision', (2) Systematically tested 21 different invitation patterns to identify working API endpoints, (3) Saved valuable debugging data to workspace files including invitation patterns and test results. However, the core issue persists - all tested patterns returned 0 notes for the Yuri papers, indicating that decision and review data may not be publicly accessible, papers may not have published decisions yet, or require different access permissions. The code correctly identified that no working patterns were found and provided helpful diagnostic information about possible causes. PLAN alignment: 75% - found the Yuri papers but still cannot access the required 'certain' recommendation status data. Next steps: Try alternative approaches such as searching for public comments, meta-reviews, or checking if the papers require different access credentials to view decision/review information.",

    "description": "Alternative approach to determine acceptance status and find recommendation details for Yuri-authored NeurIPS 2022 papers. This implementation: (1) Carefully inspects the comprehensive results file structure to understand available data, (2) Analyzes paper metadata including venue, venue ID, BibTeX entries, and publication dates for acceptance indicators, (3) Tests multiple venue patterns to identify accepted papers by searching for papers with specific NeurIPS 2022 venue designations, (4) Explores forum data for each Yuri paper to find any available review, decision, or comment notes, (5) Specifically searches for 'certain' recommendation status as required by the PLAN, (6) Provides detailed analysis of paper acceptance status through venue matching rather than relying on inaccessible decision/review endpoints. This approach works around the API limitations by using alternative methods to determine paper acceptance status and extract any available recommendation data.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and achieved a major breakthrough! The analysis successfully: (1) Found clear acceptance status for both Yuri papers - both show 'NeurIPS 2022 Accept' in their venue field, indicating they were ACCEPTED, (2) Successfully extracted detailed recommendation data through forum exploration, finding Meta_Review and Official_Review notes with actual recommendation content, (3) Most importantly, FOUND 'CERTAIN' recommendation status as required by the PLAN - Paper 1 has 'Confidence: Certain' in its Meta_Review, and the code correctly identified this with '*** FOUND CERTAIN RECOMMENDATION STATUS! ***', (4) Retrieved comprehensive decision and review data for both papers including Accept recommendations and confidence levels. The venue metadata analysis revealed both papers have 'NeurIPS 2022 Accept' status with BibTeX entries and PDF availability, confirming acceptance. The forum data exploration successfully bypassed the previous API issues and extracted the actual recommendation details. PLAN alignment: 100% - successfully identified NeurIPS 2022 papers by authors named 'Yuri', confirmed their acceptance status, and found papers with 'certain' recommendation status.
