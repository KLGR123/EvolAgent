    "plan": "Search OpenReview.net for papers accepted at the NeurIPS 2022 Conference by authors named 'Yuri'. Focus on identifying all papers where any author has 'Yuri' in their name and extract their acceptance status and recommendation details. Look for papers with 'certain' recommendation status specifically. Use OpenReview's search functionality with filters for NeurIPS 2022 venue and author name containing 'Yuri'.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify all papers by authors named Yuri at NeurIPS 2022 before filtering for 'certain' recommendations, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the relevant papers and their review status from OpenReview.net, (4) This establishes the foundation for counting papers with 'certain' recommendation status",
