# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Access and analyze the documentation, catalog, or visual materials from the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' exhibition to examine artistic representations of the twelve Chinese zodiac animals. Identify which zodiac animals are depicted with visible hands in their artistic forms, counting specifically those animals that have human-like hands or appendages that could be considered hands rather than paws, hooves, or other animal extremities.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified the 2015 Met exhibition 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' and its documentation, (2) The previous research established the exhibition context but we need to examine the actual zodiac animal representations to count visible hands, (3) Expected outcome is to analyze the twelve zodiac animals' artistic depictions and determine which ones show hands rather than typical animal appendages, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK requirement of counting zodiac animals with visible hands in the specific 2015 Met exhibition

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 3: Met Museum Portrait Accession 29.100.5: Title, Artist, Subject & Complete Catalog Metadata

**Description**: Search for information about the Metropolitan Museum of Art portrait with accession number 29.100.5. Look for the artwork's title, artist, subject, and any available metadata or catalog information. Use multiple search approaches including: (1) Direct search on the Met Museum's official website and collection database, (2) Google search with terms 'Metropolitan Museum Art 29.100.5 accession portrait', (3) Art history databases and museum catalog searches. Extract complete details about the portrait including who is depicted in the artwork.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated catalog synchronization for museum registrars to ensure internal databases reflect the latest Met accession details (title, artist, medium, dimensions) without manual entry
- Art historical research pipeline that aggregates portrait metadata (artist dates, subject constituents, tags) across online museum collections for a comparative study of 18th‐century portraiture
- E-learning module generator for an online art history platform that programmatically pulls portrait data (objectDate, culture, classification) to create interactive lesson plans
- Digital marketing dashboard integration that fetches high-resolution images and object URLs from the Met API in real time for promoting featured artworks on social media
- Art investment analytics tool that extracts medium, artist provenance, and object dimensions to feed valuation models and auction readiness reports
- Virtual reality museum exhibit builder that retrieves primaryImage URLs and descriptive metadata to dynamically populate immersive gallery environments
- Cultural heritage aggregator system that ingests detailed constituent and tag information from multiple museum APIs (including the Met) to enrich a centralized Linked Open Data repository
- Conservation management software that automatically extracts material and dimension metadata to schedule condition assessments and preventive preservation tasks

### Development Step 2: Metropolitan Museum Portrait Accession 29.100.5: Title, Artist, Subject, and Metadata Search

**Description**: Search for information about the Metropolitan Museum of Art portrait with accession number 29.100.5. Look for the artwork's title, artist, subject, and any available metadata or catalog information. Use multiple search approaches including: (1) Direct search on the Met Museum's official website and collection database, (2) Google search with terms 'Metropolitan Museum Art 29.100.5 accession portrait', (3) Art history databases and museum catalog searches. Extract complete details about the portrait including who is depicted in the artwork.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum collection management and automated metadata synchronization for accession 29.100.5 in digital archives
- Graduate art history research and batch extraction of portrait details for thematic analysis in academic publications
- Auction house provenance verification and authenticity checks using cross-referenced Met Museum accession metadata
- Virtual tour application development and real-time retrieval of portrait metadata for enhanced visitor engagement
- Digital marketing content enrichment and SEO optimization with official artwork titles and artist information
- Journalism fact-checking and rapid aggregation of catalog details for museum exhibit coverage
- Cultural heritage linked data integration and semantic querying across multiple collection APIs
- Conservation report automation and pre-population of restoration logs with Met Museum artwork metadata

### Development Step 8: Identifying 20th-Century Chinese Anti-Chiang Critics and Mao Zedong Interpreters from Stone-Carving Regions

**Description**: Search for individuals who were born in the multiple regions identified as origins of China's stone carving heritage (Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian) and who meet two specific criteria: (1) authored critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and (2) served as chief interpreter of Mao Zedong's thought. Focus on prominent Chinese political theorists, Communist Party leaders, or intellectuals from these regions who were known for both anti-Chiang Kai-shek writings and Mao Zedong interpretation work during the 20th century.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historians conducting a comparative regional study of 20th-century Chinese political thought by identifying Chongqing and Henan–born theorists who both critiqued Chiang Kai-shek and interpreted Mao Zedong’s works for journal articles.
- Museum curators organizing an exhibit on “Stone Carving Heritage and Revolutionary Ideology” who need to spotlight Fujian-origin intellectuals known for anti-Chiang writings and Mao interpretation in exhibit labels and multimedia displays.
- Political science professors designing a graduate seminar on intra-party dissent and propaganda, using the solution to compile case studies of Gansu-born Communist leaders who authored critiques of Chiang Kai-shek and served as Mao’s chief interpreters.
- Digital humanities teams building a searchable online archive of Chinese revolutionary literature, leveraging the search to tag and categorize Shanxi and Hebei authors with metadata for “anti-Chiang critique” and “Mao thought interpretation.”
- Documentary filmmakers creating a biographical film series on lesser-known Maoist theorists from stone carving heritage regions, sourcing interview subjects and archival materials from Henan and Gansu based on their dual roles.
- Publishing houses preparing an annotated translation of Mao Zedong’s speeches, using the tool to identify original Fujian interpreters whose footnotes and commentaries must be credited for historical accuracy.
- Knowledge-graph engineers mapping 20th-century Chinese political networks by enriching nodes with birthplace, anti-Chiang publications, and Mao interpretation roles for visual analytics dashboards.
- Provincial cultural affairs offices drafting heritage tourism materials that link Chongqing’s stone carving sites to local intellectuals who critiqued Chiang Kai-shek and propagated Mao Zedong thought, enhancing the region’s revolutionary narrative.

### Development Step 2: Identifying Viral Animated Rooster and Hamster Musical Duets with Tempo and Lyric Variations

**Description**: Search for animated videos featuring a rooster and a hamster performing the same song at different tempos with different lyrics. Focus on identifying popular animated content, memes, or viral videos where these two animals perform musical numbers. Look for patterns in animated series, YouTube videos, or internet memes that feature both a rooster and hamster singing variations of the same composition.

**Use Cases**:
- Animation studio research for identifying viral animal character trends and musical content inspiration
- Meme curation and discovery for social media managers seeking unique animal duet videos to boost engagement
- Academic study on the evolution of animated musical tropes involving anthropomorphic animals across internet culture
- Automated content sourcing for children’s educational platforms looking to license or feature animal-themed musical videos
- Digital marketing campaign analysis to track the popularity and spread of specific animated memes or musical parodies
- Entertainment journalists investigating the origins and variations of popular animated animal song performances
- Music educators compiling multimedia resources that showcase tempo and lyric variation in animated performances for classroom use
- Intellectual property teams monitoring web platforms for potential copyright infringements involving animated rooster and hamster musical content
