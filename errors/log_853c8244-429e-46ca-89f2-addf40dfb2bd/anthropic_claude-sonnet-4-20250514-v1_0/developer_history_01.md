    "description": 'Phase 1 implementation for researching the 2015 Metropolitan Museum exhibition titled after the Chinese zodiac animal. This code: (1) Calculates that 2015 was the Year of the Goat using zodiac cycle mathematics with verification, (2) Performs direct searches on Met Museum website URLs looking for 2015 Goat exhibitions, (3) Executes comprehensive Google searches with multiple query strategies if SERPAPI key is available, (4) Analyzes all responses for key indicators like zodiac animal mentions, 2015 references, and exhibition keywords, (5) Saves all collected data to workspace files for detailed analysis. The approach combines mathematical zodiac calculation with multi-source web research to identify the target exhibition. All search results are systematically analyzed and stored with metadata for the next phase of detailed exhibition information extraction.',

The script correctly identified 2015 as the Year of the Goat through dual verification methods, conducted systematic searches of Met Museum resources, and executed comprehensive Google searches. Key findings: (1) Found the target exhibition 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' at metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/year-of-the-ram, (2) Collected 56 Google search results with relevant indicators, (3) Successfully saved 4 data files including HTML content from Met Museum searches. The research has identified the specific exhibition and gathered substantial data about Chinese zodiac artworks at the Met. Plan alignment: 80% complete - zodiac animal identified and target exhibition found, but detailed exhibition information (dates, featured artworks, catalog details) still needs extraction from the collected data.

This code: (1) Systematically inspects all files in the workspace directory to understand their structure and content, (2) Analyzes the Google search results JSON to identify the specific "Celebration of the Year of the Ram" exhibition, (3) Extracts official Met Museum URLs for both the exhibition page and press release, (4) Fetches and parses the detailed exhibition page to extract comprehensive information including title, featured artworks, materials, and time periods, (5) Processes the press release for additional exhibition details, (6) Compiles all findings into a comprehensive exhibition information structure covering the title, featured artworks (seven Chinese ram sculptures, 14th-century painting, bronze/jade/porcelain pieces), cultural context, and official sources. The analysis successfully identifies that 2015\'s "Celebration of the Year of the Ram" was the Met\'s zodiac-themed exhibition, featuring Chinese sculptures and paintings related to the goat/ram/sheep zodiac animal, with materials including bronze, jade, rock crystal, and celadon porcelain from various historical periods including the 14th and 18th centuries.',
