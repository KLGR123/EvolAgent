# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Analyze the documented artworks from the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' exhibition to identify which of the twelve Chinese zodiac animals have visible hands. Focus on examining the jade zodiac sculpture set from the 18th-19th century that featured all twelve zodiac animals, as well as any other zodiac representations in the exhibition. Count specifically how many of the twelve zodiac animals (Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig) are depicted with visible hands in their artistic representations.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified the 2015 Met exhibition 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' and documented its contents including the complete jade zodiac set, (2) The previous research established that the exhibition featured all twelve Chinese zodiac animals through various artworks, particularly the jade sculpture collection, (3) Expected outcome is to examine each zodiac animal representation and count those with visible hands, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK requirement of determining how many of the twelve zodiac animals have hands visible in this specific exhibition

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 8: Identifying 20th-Century Chinese Anti-Chiang Critics and Mao Zedong Interpreters from Stone-Carving Regions

**Description**: Search for individuals who were born in the multiple regions identified as origins of China's stone carving heritage (Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian) and who meet two specific criteria: (1) authored critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and (2) served as chief interpreter of Mao Zedong's thought. Focus on prominent Chinese political theorists, Communist Party leaders, or intellectuals from these regions who were known for both anti-Chiang Kai-shek writings and Mao Zedong interpretation work during the 20th century.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historians conducting a comparative regional study of 20th-century Chinese political thought by identifying Chongqing and Henan‚Äìborn theorists who both critiqued Chiang Kai-shek and interpreted Mao Zedong‚Äôs works for journal articles.
- Museum curators organizing an exhibit on ‚ÄúStone Carving Heritage and Revolutionary Ideology‚Äù who need to spotlight Fujian-origin intellectuals known for anti-Chiang writings and Mao interpretation in exhibit labels and multimedia displays.
- Political science professors designing a graduate seminar on intra-party dissent and propaganda, using the solution to compile case studies of Gansu-born Communist leaders who authored critiques of Chiang Kai-shek and served as Mao‚Äôs chief interpreters.
- Digital humanities teams building a searchable online archive of Chinese revolutionary literature, leveraging the search to tag and categorize Shanxi and Hebei authors with metadata for ‚Äúanti-Chiang critique‚Äù and ‚ÄúMao thought interpretation.‚Äù
- Documentary filmmakers creating a biographical film series on lesser-known Maoist theorists from stone carving heritage regions, sourcing interview subjects and archival materials from Henan and Gansu based on their dual roles.
- Publishing houses preparing an annotated translation of Mao Zedong‚Äôs speeches, using the tool to identify original Fujian interpreters whose footnotes and commentaries must be credited for historical accuracy.
- Knowledge-graph engineers mapping 20th-century Chinese political networks by enriching nodes with birthplace, anti-Chiang publications, and Mao interpretation roles for visual analytics dashboards.
- Provincial cultural affairs offices drafting heritage tourism materials that link Chongqing‚Äôs stone carving sites to local intellectuals who critiqued Chiang Kai-shek and propagated Mao Zedong thought, enhancing the region‚Äôs revolutionary narrative.

### Development Step 11: 20th-Century Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian Theorists Who Critiqued Chiang and Interpreted Mao

**Description**: Search for individuals who were born in the multiple regions identified as origins of China's stone carving heritage (Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian) and who meet two specific criteria: (1) authored critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and (2) served as chief interpreter of Mao Zedong's thought. Focus on prominent Chinese political theorists, Communist Party leaders, or intellectuals from these regions who were known for both anti-Chiang Kai-shek writings and Mao Zedong interpretation work during the 20th century.

**Use Cases**:
- A university history department uses the tool to compile a regional index of Chinese political theorists born in Gansu who authored critiques of Chiang Kai-shek, enabling targeted archival research for a doctoral thesis.
- A national museum employs the solution to generate an interactive exhibit mapping stone carving heritage sites in Fujian linked to Chen Boda‚Äôs ideological writings, enriching visitor engagement with multimedia storytelling.
- A digital humanities lab leverages the script to build a geospatial network of 20th-century Communist intellectuals from Chongqing, visualizing their anti-Kuomintang publications and Mao interpretation roles for a peer-reviewed study.
- A political think tank applies the method to analyze the concentration of anti-Chiang propaganda and Mao Thought interpreters in Shanxi, informing policy papers on regional ideological shifts during the Cultural Revolution.
- A cultural preservation NGO uses the research framework to match artisanship regions in Henan with local Marxist theorists, prioritizing community workshops that intertwine stone carving traditions and historical education.
- An edTech company integrates the dataset into its platform to auto-generate lesson plans on Chinese Communist ideologues‚Äô birthplaces and writings, offering history teachers region-specific modules for classroom use.
- A library consortium automates the tagging and JSON export of manuscripts by birthplace and ideological criteria, streamlining cataloging of mid-20th century political pamphlets for digital archives.
- An intelligence historian leverages the analysis to reconstruct routes of Mao Zedong Thought dissemination by Shanxi-born theorists, supporting documentaries on propaganda networks for broadcast media.

### Development Step 9: Chinese Intellectuals from Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian Critiquing Chiang Kai-shek and Interpreting Mao

**Description**: Search for individuals who were born in the multiple regions identified as origins of China's stone carving heritage (Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian) and who meet two specific criteria: (1) authored critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and (2) served as chief interpreter of Mao Zedong's thought. Focus on prominent Chinese political theorists, Communist Party leaders, or intellectuals from these regions who were known for both anti-Chiang Kai-shek writings and Mao Zedong interpretation work during the 20th century.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic research on regional ideological development: historians use the scraper to compile a dataset of 20th-century Chinese theorists born in Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, or Fujian who published anti‚ÄìChiang Kai-shek critiques and served as Mao Zedong thought interpreters, enabling quantitative analysis of regional variations in Communist Party scholarship.
- University digital humanities archive creation: a campus library employs the solution to automatically discover and catalog biographies, writings, and speeches of prominent anti-Chiang authors and Mao interpreters from stone-carving heritage regions, building an online portal for students and scholars.
- Museum exhibition curation on political art heritage: curators mining online resources to identify intellectual figures linking China‚Äôs stone carving traditions with Maoist ideology, gathering images, publications, and regional background data for exhibit panels and multimedia installations.
- Political science think-tank network mapping: analysts leverage the scraping tool to extract profiles of Communist Party leaders with anti-Chiang writings and Mao interpretation roles, then visualize their regional connections and influence networks for policy whitepapers.
- Historical documentary production research: film researchers automate web searches for Chinese intellectuals from Fujian or Hebei known for Mao Zedong thought interpretation, compiling timelines, archived interviews, and critique excerpts to support narrative scripts and archival footage selection.
- Publishing house reference compilation: editors use the scraper‚Äôs filtered results to assemble an accurate bibliography of 20th-century Mao interpreters critical of Chiang Kai-shek, streamlining fact-checking and author attribution for a forthcoming scholarly anthology.
- AI-driven knowledge graph enhancement: data scientists feed the extracted metadata on anti-Chiang critiques and Mao interpretation roles into a semantic knowledge graph, improving entity linking and regional tagging in tools for political historiography analysis.

### Development Step 3: Met Museum Portrait Accession 29.100.5: Title, Artist, Subject & Complete Catalog Metadata

**Description**: Search for information about the Metropolitan Museum of Art portrait with accession number 29.100.5. Look for the artwork's title, artist, subject, and any available metadata or catalog information. Use multiple search approaches including: (1) Direct search on the Met Museum's official website and collection database, (2) Google search with terms 'Metropolitan Museum Art 29.100.5 accession portrait', (3) Art history databases and museum catalog searches. Extract complete details about the portrait including who is depicted in the artwork.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated catalog synchronization for museum registrars to ensure internal databases reflect the latest Met accession details (title, artist, medium, dimensions) without manual entry
- Art historical research pipeline that aggregates portrait metadata (artist dates, subject constituents, tags) across online museum collections for a comparative study of 18th‚Äêcentury portraiture
- E-learning module generator for an online art history platform that programmatically pulls portrait data (objectDate, culture, classification) to create interactive lesson plans
- Digital marketing dashboard integration that fetches high-resolution images and object URLs from the Met API in real time for promoting featured artworks on social media
- Art investment analytics tool that extracts medium, artist provenance, and object dimensions to feed valuation models and auction readiness reports
- Virtual reality museum exhibit builder that retrieves primaryImage URLs and descriptive metadata to dynamically populate immersive gallery environments
- Cultural heritage aggregator system that ingests detailed constituent and tag information from multiple museum APIs (including the Met) to enrich a centralized Linked Open Data repository
- Conservation management software that automatically extracts material and dimension metadata to schedule condition assessments and preventive preservation tasks

### Development Step 1: Origins of China‚Äôs National Intangible Cultural Heritage Stone Carving Techniques by Region

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify China's national intangible cultural heritage stone carving techniques and determine where they originated. Search for keywords including 'China national intangible cultural heritage stone carving', 'Chinese stone carving techniques origin', 'traditional stone carving China UNESCO', and 'intangible cultural heritage stone sculpture China'. Focus on identifying the specific city, region, or province where these traditional stone carving techniques first developed and are recognized as originating from.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum exhibition curation for Chinese stone carving heritage showcases: gather origin city and technique data to create accurate interpretive labels and catalogs.
- Cultural tourism itinerary planning for travel agencies: map provinces like Fujian (Shoushan), Hebei (Quyang) and Sichuan (Dazu) to design specialized stone carving heritage tours.
- Academic research mapping intangible heritage diffusion: compile regional origin details for a historical geography dissertation on traditional stone sculpture techniques.
- Government heritage preservation grant proposal drafting: collect authoritative birthplace information to support UNESCO intangible cultural heritage nominations for local carving traditions.
- E-commerce artisan sourcing and provenance verification: verify master carver hometowns in Quyang and Shoushan to authenticate product listings on an online craft marketplace.
- Virtual reality cultural preservation projects: integrate region-specific stone carving metadata into 3D reconstructions of traditional workshops in Zhejiang and Sichuan.
- Art investment and authenticity appraisal services: research origins of carving techniques to validate stone sculpture provenance for collectors and galleries.
- Architectural restoration and cultural consultancy: advise restoration projects using detailed origin-based stone carving style profiles for heritage buildings in Henan and Yunnan.
