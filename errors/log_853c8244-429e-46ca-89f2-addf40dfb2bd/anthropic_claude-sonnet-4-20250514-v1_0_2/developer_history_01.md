The code systematically processes the search data to identify and compile comprehensive information about the 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' exhibition, including its full title, exact dates (January 17–April 12, 2015), location (The Met Fifth Avenue), featured artworks (seven Chinese sculptures in ram shapes plus a 14th-century sheep painting), materials used (bronze, jade, rock crystal, celadon porcelain), and related events (Lunar New Year Festival on February 28, 2015). The analysis confirms that 2015 was the Year of the Goat/Sheep/Ram in the Chinese zodiac, and successfully documents the Met's exhibition that was specifically titled after this zodiac animal. All findings are compiled into a structured JSON file with complete exhibition metadata, official source URLs, and contextual information about the Chinese New Year celebration period.",
