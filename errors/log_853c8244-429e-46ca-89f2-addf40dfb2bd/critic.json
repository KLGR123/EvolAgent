  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine how many of the twelve Chinese zodiac animals have visible hands in the 2015 Metropolitan Museum exhibition titled after that year's zodiac animal. All members correctly identified 2015 as the Year of the Goat/Ram and located the exhibition 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' (January 17â€“April 12, 2015). However, critical divergence emerged in understanding what constituted the 'twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac' in this specific exhibition. Member 1 conducted the most methodologically rigorous analysis, discovering that the exhibition actually featured only ram/sheep-related artworks (7 Chinese ram sculptures, 1 painting of grazing sheep, 1 kneeling ram vessel = 9 total objects), not a complete set of all twelve zodiac animals. Member 1's systematic investigation of the actual exhibition content revealed that all displayed pieces depicted hooved animals (rams/sheep) which anatomically possess hooves rather than hands. Member 2 incorrectly assumed the exhibition contained representations of all twelve zodiac animals and provided a count of 7 based on general zodiac iconography rather than the specific exhibition content. Member 3 found evidence of a separate jade zodiac set in the Met's collection but incorrectly conflated this with the 2015 exhibition content, providing a count of 2. Cross-analysis validation: Only Member 1's approach directly examined the actual artworks displayed in the specified 2015 exhibition rather than making assumptions about zodiac completeness. Convergence on exhibition identification but divergence on content analysis methodology. Final synthesis: The question asks specifically about animals in 'the 2015 Metropolitan Museum exhibition,' which contained only ram/sheep representations. Since rams and sheep are ungulates with hooves, zero animals in this exhibition have visible hands.",
