  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify how many of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac have visible hands in the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition titled after that year's zodiac animal. All members correctly identified 2015 as the Year of the Ram/Goat and located the exhibition 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' (January 17-April 12, 2015). However, critical divergences emerged in interpretation and methodology. Member 1 applied anatomical feasibility as primary criterion, concluding only Dragon (mythical creature with hand-like claws) and Monkey (natural primate hands) could logically have hands - yielding answer of 2. Member 2 used similar anatomical reasoning but concluded only Monkey has hands, excluding Dragon - yielding answer of 1. Member 3 conducted visual analysis of actual exhibition artworks, claiming to identify 37 zodiac animals with hands across multiple pieces, but this appears to conflate individual artwork instances with the core question about 'the twelve animals.' Cross-analysis reveals fundamental interpretation difference: Members 1-2 analyzed which of the twelve zodiac animal types can anatomically have hands, while Member 3 counted total instances across all artworks. The task specifically asks about 'the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac' - referring to the standard set of twelve animal types, not total counts across multiple artworks. Convergence assessment: Members 1-2 agree on methodology and exhibition identification, differing only on Dragon classification. Member 3's approach, while thorough in visual analysis, misinterprets the fundamental question. Resolution: Member 1's inclusion of Dragon is more defensible given traditional Chinese artistic representations where dragons are depicted with hand-like claws/talons that function as hands. Final validation: Among the twelve zodiac animals (Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig), only Dragon and Monkey are consistently depicted with hand-like appendages in traditional Chinese art.",
