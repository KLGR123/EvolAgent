    "description": "Implementation of Phase 1 research strategy to identify the 2015 Met Museum exhibition titled after the Chinese zodiac animal. This code: (1) Determines that 2015 was the Year of the Goat/Sheep/Ram in the Chinese zodiac, (2) Conducts direct searches on Met Museum website for 2015 exhibitions, (3) Uses Google Search API with targeted queries combining '2015', 'Metropolitan Museum', and zodiac animal terms, (4) Analyzes search results for key indicators like exhibition mentions, catalog references, and Met Museum sources, (5) Saves all collected data to workspace files for detailed analysis. The approach systematically gathers information from both official Met sources and comprehensive web searches to locate the specific exhibition. Files created include HTML responses from Met Museum website and JSON data from Google searches, all organized for subsequent detailed analysis to extract exhibition details.",

The research has yielded excellent results with clear evidence of the Metropolitan Museum's 2015 zodiac exhibition. Key findings: (1) Confirmed 2015 was the Year of the Goat/Sheep/Ram, (2) Successfully discovered the Met's exhibition titled 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' running January 17–April 12, 2015, (3) Found multiple official Met Museum URLs confirming the exhibition details, (4) Collected comprehensive search results with 39 priority matches containing multiple key indicators. The Google searches revealed the exact exhibition with official Met Museum sources showing exhibition dates, featured artworks (seven Chinese sculptures in ram shapes plus 14th-century painting of grazing sheep), and catalog information. The code has successfully completed the PLAN objective by identifying the specific exhibition and gathering substantial documentation.

This code: (1) Inspects workspace files to understand the JSON structure from previous searches, (2) Analyzes Google search results to identify the specific exhibition "Celebration of the Year of the Ram", (3) Accesses the official Met Museum exhibition page and press release for detailed information, (4) Extracts key details including exhibition dates (January 17–April 12, 2015), featured artworks (7 Chinese sculptures in ram shapes plus 14th-century painting of grazing sheep), materials (bronze, jade, rock crystal, celadon porcelain), and gallery location, (5) Compiles a comprehensive report with all exhibition metadata, related events, and official URLs. The approach systematically builds upon the previous research to create a complete documentation of the exhibition, saving both raw HTML content and processed details to multiple workspace files for thorough documentation of the 2015 Met Museum zodiac exhibition.',
