    "plan": "Research the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition that was titled after the Chinese zodiac animal of 2015. First identify what Chinese zodiac animal corresponds to 2015, then locate the specific Met exhibition with that animal's name in the title. Extract details about the exhibition including its full title, dates, and description to understand the context and scope of this exhibition.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the Chinese zodiac animal for 2015 and find the corresponding Met exhibition before analyzing any artworks, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the specific 2015 Met exhibition and understand its theme and content, (4) This provides the foundation for subsequently identifying and analyzing the twelve zodiac animal representations to count visible hands',

Locate detailed images or descriptions of each of the twelve zodiac animal sculptures to examine which ones have visible hands or human-like appendages that could be considered hands.",
    "description": "This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified the 2015 Met exhibition 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' and know it included a set of twelve Chinese zodiac animal sculptures, (2) The TASK specifically asks about how many of these twelve zodiac animals have a hand visible, so we need to examine each animal representation individually, (3) Expected outcome is to locate detailed visual documentation or descriptions of the twelve zodiac animal artworks from this exhibition, (4) This will enable us to systematically count which zodiac animals are depicted with visible hands or human-like appendages",
