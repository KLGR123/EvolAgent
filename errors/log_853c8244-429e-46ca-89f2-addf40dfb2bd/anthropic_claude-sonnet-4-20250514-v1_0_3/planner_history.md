First identify what the Chinese zodiac animal was for 2015, then locate the specific Met exhibition with that animal's name in the title. Extract comprehensive information about this exhibition including its full title, dates, featured artworks, and any available catalog or documentation.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify what Chinese zodiac animal corresponds to 2015 and find the Met exhibition named after it, (2) No previous research has been conducted based on the empty HISTORY, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the specific 2015 Met exhibition and understand its scope and featured works, (4) This provides the foundation for subsequently analyzing the twelve zodiac animals representation in the exhibition to count those with visible hands',

    "plan": "Access and analyze the specific artworks featured in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' exhibition from 2015. Focus on examining the visual representations of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac within the exhibition's featured pieces, particularly looking for any depictions that show hands or human-like appendages. Extract detailed information about each zodiac animal representation and systematically count how many show visible hands.",
    "description": "This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified the 2015 Met exhibition 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' with its featured artworks including Chinese sculptures and paintings, (2) The previous research established the exhibition context but we need to examine the actual zodiac animal representations within the artworks, (3) Expected outcome is to analyze the visual content of the exhibition pieces to identify which of the twelve Chinese zodiac animals are depicted with visible hands, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK requirement of counting zodiac animals with hands visible in this specific 2015 Met exhibition",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive analysis conducted by the developer: (1) The 2015 Chinese zodiac animal was identified as the Ram (also known as Goat or Sheep), (2) The Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition was 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' (January 17–April 12, 2015), (3) The developer conducted systematic visual analysis of the exhibition's featured artworks using AI-powered image analysis of actual museum pieces, (4) Through examination of 7 zodiac-specific artworks from the exhibition, the developer identified and counted zodiac animals with visible hands or human-like appendages. The analysis found that across all the featured artworks in the exhibition, there are 37 instances of Chinese zodiac animals depicted with visible hands, with the primary contribution coming from the artwork 'Twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac' (jade, 18th-19th century) which shows all 12 zodiac animals with human-like hands. Final answer: 37 zodiac animals have visible hands in the 2015 Met exhibition.",
