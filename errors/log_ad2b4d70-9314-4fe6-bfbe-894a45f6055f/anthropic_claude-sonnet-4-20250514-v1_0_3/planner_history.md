    "plan": 'Search for Eva Draconis on YouTube to locate her channel and identify any personal website links. Look for her YouTube page, examine the channel description, about section, and any links provided to find her personal website URL. Extract the website information so we can access it in the next step.',
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to first locate Eva Draconis's YouTube channel to find the link to her personal website, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to identify her YouTube channel and extract the personal website URL from her channel information, (4) This establishes the foundation for accessing her personal website where we can analyze the top banner symbols as required by the TASK.",
