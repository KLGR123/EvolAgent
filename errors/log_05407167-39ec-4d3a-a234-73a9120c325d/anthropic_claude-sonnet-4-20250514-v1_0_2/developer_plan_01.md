# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for the 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com to locate the specific article that contains a video demonstration. Focus on finding blog posts from 2018 that discuss VSCode integration, features, or tutorials on the Replit platform. Once found, analyze the content to identify the last video mentioned in the post and determine what command was clicked to remove extra lines.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate the specific 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com before we can analyze its video content, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this task, (3) Expected outcome is to find the relevant blog post and identify the video that demonstrates line removal functionality, (4) This establishes the foundation for determining the exact command that was clicked in the last video to remove extra lines.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 9: Extract and Transcribe "Isn't That Hot?" Dialogue and Teal’c’s Reply from YouTube Video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal video evidence processing to transcribe courtroom footage and extract witness statements containing specific phrases for case preparation
- Customer support call QA automation by transcribing recorded service calls to identify “I’m not satisfied” or similar complaint triggers for supervisor review
- Market research on product demo videos to locate and compile user feedback comments like “this feature is great” for prioritizing development roadmaps
- Social media moderation by analyzing livestreams to detect and flag policy-violating language in real time for compliance teams
- Educational lecture indexing to transcribe university seminars, tag question-and-answer segments, and enable students to search for “Can you explain...” queries
- Media production highlight creation by extracting memorable soundbites from celebrity interviews (“That was awesome!”) for promotional reels
- Accessibility caption generation for online courses by transcribing instructor dialogue and identifying speaker changes for precise subtitle synchronization
- Linguistic research on archival broadcasts to automatically transcribe and analyze usage patterns of phrases such as “Do you really think...” across decades

### Development Step 2: Locate “Isn’t That Hot?” Dialogue in YouTube Video and Document Teal’c’s Exact Response

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate eLearning team retrieving and timestamping critical Q&A segments from training videos for onboarding documentation
- Legal eDiscovery specialists scanning and transcribing targeted dialogue from publicly posted deposition videos for case evidence preparation
- Marketing analysts monitoring influencer product reviews on YouTube, extracting and cataloging instances of brand mentions for sentiment tracking
- Academic linguistics researchers locating and transcribing specific phonetic phenomena in lecture videos to support corpus-based language studies
- Compliance officers identifying segments in financial webinars where regulatory requirements are discussed, to ensure accurate policy implementation
- Podcast producers automating extraction of sponsor-read ad segments from long-form video content to streamline editing and QC processes
- Accessibility coordinators generating precise transcripts of key interactions in educational videos to improve captioning accuracy for hearing-impaired students

### Development Step 4: Find Teal’c’s Response to “Isn’t That Hot?” in YouTube Video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Extracting and transcribing customer support training videos to locate “Isn’t that required?” questions and capture the trainer’s exact clarifications for building an automated FAQ database
- Processing courtroom hearing recordings to find when attorneys ask “Isn’t that admissible?” and documenting the judge’s precise rulings for legal case management systems
- Analyzing product demo webinars to identify “Isn’t that expensive?” viewer queries and extract the presenter’s detailed cost‐benefit responses for marketing collateral
- Indexing academic lecture videos to transcribe moments when students ask “Isn’t that assumption flawed?” and record the professor’s counterarguments for online course summaries
- Reviewing medical conference sessions to locate “Isn’t that harmful?” audience concerns and capture the expert’s exact explanations for compliance documentation
- Localizing film trailers by transcribing “Isn’t that dramatic?” taglines and extracting actors’ follow‐up lines to generate accurate subtitles and dubbing scripts
- Auditing internal compliance briefing videos to find “Isn’t that mandatory?” employee queries and preserve the compliance officer’s responses for policy enforcement records

### Development Step 10: Locate and Transcribe Teal'c’s Reply to “Isn’t That Hot?” in YouTube Video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Extracting and timestamping key customer feedback phrases (e.g., “This product saved me”) from recorded user testimonial videos to streamline marketing content creation
- Automatically identifying and isolating objection-handling responses (e.g., “Isn’t that expensive?”) in sales training recordings for targeted coaching improvements
- Scanning archived corporate town hall livestreams to locate and transcribe specific policy-related Q&A segments (e.g., “How will this impact our benefits?”) for HR documentation
- Monitoring compliance in financial webinars by detecting and extracting disclaimers (e.g., “Past performance does not guarantee future results”) to ensure regulatory adherence
- Harvesting precise technical definitions (e.g., “A tensor is…”) from recorded academic lectures to build a searchable glossary for e-learning platforms
- Analyzing product review unboxing videos to find and compile sensory reaction comments (e.g., “It feels so smooth”) for R&D insights on material performance
- Reviewing legal deposition videos to pinpoint and transcribe witness admissions of fact (e.g., “I saw him at 8 p.m.”) to accelerate case preparation
- Indexing cooking show episodes to extract chef remarks on safety (e.g., “Be careful—this oil is extremely hot”) for automated closed-caption warnings in streaming services
