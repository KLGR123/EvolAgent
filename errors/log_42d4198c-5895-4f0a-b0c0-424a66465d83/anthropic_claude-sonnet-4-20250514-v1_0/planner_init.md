# Planner Initialization

## Task
I'm curious about how much information is available for popular video games before their release. Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?

## Episodic Examples
### Number of Edits on the Antidisestablishmentarianism Wikipedia Page (Inception to June 2023)

**TASK**: How many edits were made to the Wikipedia page on Antidisestablishmentarianism from its inception until June of 2023?

### Fewest Wikipedia clicks from Lord of the Rings to A Song of Ice and Fire

**TASK**: What is the minimum number of page links a person must click on to go from the english Wikipedia page on The Lord of the Rings (the book) to the english Wikipedia page on A Song of Ice and Fire (the book series)?
