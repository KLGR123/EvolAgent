    "description": "This code implements a comprehensive analysis of the God of War (2018) Wikipedia page to extract the release date and count pre-release revisions. The approach follows these steps: (1) Access the current Wikipedia page and parse the infobox to extract the official release date information, looking for date patterns in both structured data and main content, (2) Use the Wikipedia API with pagination to extract the complete revision history of the page, making multiple requests to gather all available revisions from creation to present, (3) Parse revision timestamps and categorize them as pre-release or post-release based on the identified release month, (4) Generate comprehensive statistics and save detailed analysis files to workspace. The code includes extensive error handling, progress reporting, and creates multiple output files (JSON data, summary report) for thorough documentation. This systematic approach ensures accurate identification of both the release date and the exact count of Wikipedia revisions that existed before the game's official release, fulfilling the PLAN requirements completely.",

    "feedback": 'Execution failed - Code encountered mixed success but failed to complete the **PLAN** requirements. The code successfully extracted the release date (April 20, 2018) from the Wikipedia page, correctly identifying April as the release month. However, the revision history extraction failed due to API errors (Status: 503). The code made only 1 API request before encountering the error, preventing collection of any revision data. **PLAN** alignment: 50% - release date extraction succeeded but revision counting failed completely. The output also contains unrelated content about Tri-Rail documents that appears to be from a different process. Main technical issue: Wikipedia API returned 503 errors, blocking access to revision history data. Next steps: (1) Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for API requests, (2) Add alternative approaches like using different Wikipedia API endpoints, (3) Consider using archived revision data sources if API continues to fail. The current page analysis was saved successfully, but the core objective of counting pre-release revisions remains incomplete.',

    "description": "This code implements a robust approach to complete the PLAN by: (1) First checking existing workspace data to see if we already have the release date information from the previous run, inspecting file structure before loading, (2) If needed, re-extracting the release date from the Wikipedia page with proper error handling, (3) Implementing a comprehensive revision history extraction using the Wikipedia API with exponential backoff retry logic to handle 503 errors and rate limiting, (4) Processing all collected revisions to categorize them as pre-release or post-release based on the April 2018 release date, (5) Generating detailed analysis including revision counts, timeline information, and sample data, (6) Creating multiple output files (JSON analysis, summary report) with comprehensive statistics. The code includes extensive error handling, progress reporting, and retry mechanisms to overcome the API failures encountered in the previous attempt. This systematic approach ensures we can successfully count the Wikipedia revisions that existed before God of War (2018)'s official release, completing the PLAN requirements.",

    "feedback": 'Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements comprehensively. The robust implementation successfully extracted the release date (April 20, 2018, release month: April) from existing workspace data and then collected the complete revision history using Wikipedia API with retry logic. The code made 6 API requests and gathered 2,604 total revisions spanning from 2016-06-14 to 2025-08-06. The analysis correctly identified 477 revisions that occurred before April 2018 (pre-release) and 2,127 revisions after release. The pre-release revision timeline shows activity from June 14, 2016 (first edit) to March 24, 2018 (last pre-release edit). **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all objectives achieved: (1) Release date extracted: April 20, 2018, (2) Release month identified: April, (3) Complete revision history retrieved, (4) Pre-release revisions counted: 477. The code created comprehensive documentation files including detailed analysis (2,863 bytes) and final summary report.
