    "plan": "Search for information about the 2019 British Academy Games Awards (BAFTA Games Awards) winner to identify which game won the main award that year. Focus on finding the Game of the Year or equivalent top prize winner, as this would be considered 'the game that won' the awards. Extract the game title, verify it was released in 2019, and gather basic information about the winning title to prepare for Wikipedia analysis.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards before we can analyze its Wikipedia page, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this task, (3) Expected outcome is to determine which game won the main BAFTA Games Award in 2019, (4) This establishes the foundation for subsequent Wikipedia page analysis including revision history and release date information',
