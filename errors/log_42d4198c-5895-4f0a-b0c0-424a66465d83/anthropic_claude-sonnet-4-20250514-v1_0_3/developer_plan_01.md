# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for information about the 2019 British Academy Games Awards (BAFTA Games Awards) winner to identify which game won the main award that year. Focus on finding the Game of the Year or equivalent top prize winner, as this would be considered 'the game that won' the awards. Extract the game title, verify it was released in 2019, and gather basic information about the winning title to prepare for Wikipedia analysis.

## Description
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards before we can analyze its Wikipedia page, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this task, (3) Expected outcome is to determine which game won the main BAFTA Games Award in 2019, (4) This establishes the foundation for subsequent Wikipedia page analysis including revision history and release date information

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 61: Extract American Idol Season Winners Table from Wikipedia to JSON File

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol and extract the season-by-season winners table into workspace/american_idol_winners_list.json, capturing each season number and winner name.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated update of a fan trivia mobile app’s question bank by extracting each American Idol season winner into JSON for real-time quiz refresh
- Integration into a music analytics pipeline that correlates show winners with streaming numbers to model post-show career success
- Feeding a chatbot’s knowledge base for a television trivia assistant, enabling instant answers about which contestant won each season
- Populating an entertainment marketing dashboard that tracks winner announcements and triggers tailored email campaigns to reality TV subscribers
- Building a labeled dataset of names and seasons for training an NLP model to recognize proper nouns and dates in televised competition transcripts
- Powering a research study on reality competition outcomes by aggregating winner data alongside Nielsen ratings and social media engagement metrics
- Streamlining content curation for a streaming service by linking each winner’s discography and spotlight episodes to improve recommendation algorithms

### Development Step 8: Identify Who Nominated Giganotosaurus as Featured Article in November 2016

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia Featured Article Candidates (FAC) page or nomination history for the Giganotosaurus article to identify who originally nominated it for Featured Article status in November 2016. Search for the FAC discussion page, nomination details, or article talk page archives that show the nomination process, including the username of the person who submitted the initial nomination for Featured Article consideration.

**Use Cases**:
- Wikipedia community managers tracking nomination histories to recognize prolific nominators and award community badges
- Academic digital humanities researchers analyzing nomination discussions to study peer review dynamics in online encyclopedias
- Non-profit board oversight generating reports on volunteer contributions by extracting nomination data for annual transparency statements
- Corporate knowledge management teams auditing internal wiki nomination processes to ensure compliance with editorial standards
- Data journalism teams investigating article curation patterns by mapping nomination dates and user involvement in high-profile Wikipedia topics
- AI researchers creating labeled datasets of nomination behaviors and editorial timelines from FAC archives for machine learning on collaborative editing
- Educational institutions teaching digital literacy using real nomination archives to demonstrate collaborative quality control workflows in open-access knowledge bases

### Development Step 4: Berlin Club’s 1984 DDR-Pokal Triumph and Their 1985–86 European Competition Details

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the Berlin-based football club that won the last East German Cup in 1984.

### Development Step 6: Identify Berlin Club Winning 1984 DDR-Pokal and Its 1985-86 European Match Details

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the Berlin-based football club that won the last East German Cup in 1984. Search for keywords including 'East German Cup 1984 winner Berlin football club', 'DDR-Pokal 1984 final Berlin team', 'last East German Cup 1984 champion', and 'GDR Cup 1984 Berlin football'. Focus on identifying which Berlin club won this final East German Cup tournament and gather information about their European competition participation in the 1985-86 season, particularly any matches on 2 October 1985.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated sports journalism verification: a football reporter uses the solution to fact-check the winner and finalists of the 1984 FDGB-Pokal before publishing a retrospective article on East German Cup history.
- Historical database enrichment for a sports analytics platform: a data engineer integrates the automated search and JSON‐parsing pipeline to populate records of 1984–85 European competition participants, including match dates like 2 October 1985.
- Academic research support in sports history: a PhD student leverages the comprehensive analysis script to source and categorize primary online snippets on DDR-Pokal finals and Berlin clubs for a dissertation chapter on East German football.
- Fact-checking feed for a sports broadcasting network: a production assistant runs the code to confirm whether BFC Dynamo ever won the last East German Cup, ensuring on‐air commentary is historically accurate.
- Content generation for a football heritage website: a webmaster employs the search results analysis and report generation to automatically build a “On This Day in East German Football” section featuring Dynamo Dresden vs. BFC Dynamo finals.
- SEO optimization for a sports history blog: a digital marketer uses the categorization outputs and definitive evidence snippets to identify high-value keywords (“1984 FDGB-Pokal”, “BFC Dynamo finalist”) and boost search rankings.
- Archive digitization project for a sports museum: an archivist applies the pipeline to sift through online references and compile a JSON timeline of East German Cup winners and European matches, feeding a digital exhibit on 1980s German football.
