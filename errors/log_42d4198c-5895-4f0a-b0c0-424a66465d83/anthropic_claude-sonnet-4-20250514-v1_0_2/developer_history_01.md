This implementation conducts 10 targeted search queries to identify the main award winner (Best Game category) from the 2019 British Academy Games Awards ceremony. The search strategy includes various query formulations to capture different ways the information might be presented online, including 'Best Game winner', 'Game of the Year', and 'Outstanding Achievement' variations. Each search result is analyzed for relevance indicators like game titles, winner information, and award categories. Results are categorized and saved to workspace for detailed analysis, with immediate insights provided through quick categorization of winner information, Best Game mentions, and ceremony details. This establishes the foundation for identifying the specific game that won the main award in 2019.",
