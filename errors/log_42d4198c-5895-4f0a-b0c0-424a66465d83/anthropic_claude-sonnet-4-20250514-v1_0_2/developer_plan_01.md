# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for information about the 2019 British Academy Games Awards (BAFTA Games Awards) to identify which game won the main award that year. Look for the winner of the 'Best Game' or equivalent top category award from the 2019 ceremony. Extract the game title, developer information, and any other relevant details about this award-winning game.

## Description
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards before we can analyze its Wikipedia page revision history, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to determine the award-winning game title from the 2019 BAFTA Games Awards ceremony, (4) This establishes the foundation for locating the game's Wikipedia page and analyzing its revision history relative to the release date

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 4: Berlin Club’s 1984 DDR-Pokal Triumph and Their 1985–86 European Competition Details

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the Berlin-based football club that won the last East German Cup in 1984. Search for keywords including 'East German Cup 1984 winner Berlin football club', 'DDR-Pokal 1984 final Berlin team', 'last East German Cup 1984 champion', and 'GDR Cup 1984 Berlin football'. Focus on identifying which Berlin club won this final East German Cup tournament and gather information about their European competition participation in the 1985-86 season, particularly any matches on 2 October 1985.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated sports journalism fact-checking and historical content creation for articles on football tournaments
- Digital archiving of match metadata and structured event summaries for sports history libraries
- Academic research data extraction for studies on East German football competitions and tournament trends
- Fan engagement platform integration to answer live queries about past cup winners and match dates
- Quality assurance workflows for sports statistics databases, cross-referencing online sources to detect discrepancies
- Chatbot knowledge base enrichment for delivering accurate football trivia and historical match details
- Marketing campaign asset generation for club anniversary events, compiling verified highlights and key milestones
- Publishing workflow automation for fact-based infographics on football competition outcomes and club achievements

### Development Step 7: Identify Berlin Football Club Winning 1984 DDR-Pokal and Its October 2, 1985 European Match

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the Berlin-based football club that won the last East German Cup in 1984. Search for keywords including 'East German Cup 1984 winner Berlin football club', 'DDR-Pokal 1984 final Berlin team', 'last East German Cup 1984 champion', and 'GDR Cup 1984 Berlin football'. Focus on identifying which Berlin club won this final East German Cup tournament and gather information about their European competition participation in the 1985-86 season, particularly any matches on 2 October 1985.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports historians automating the retrieval of archived match reports and statistics for museum exhibitions on East German football
- Investigative sports journalists verifying specific game dates, opponents, and venues to fact-check feature articles on BFC Dynamo’s European campaigns
- Football fan sites populating their club history pages with accurate details from the 1985-86 UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup using targeted web searches
- Documentary researchers compiling precise timelines and contextual snippets for a film on DDR-era football through multi-query API extraction
- Academic sports scientists aggregating performance data of East German clubs in European competitions for statistical trend analysis
- Data engineers building a structured historical sports database by systematically querying and filtering online sources for exact match information
- Educators designing interactive quizzes and lesson plans on German football history, automatically sourcing validated match outcomes and dates
- Mobile app developers integrating a dynamic timeline feature that auto-loads historical match events (e.g., 2 October 1985) for fan engagement tools

### Development Step 8: Identify 1984 East German Cup Berlin Winner and Their 1985–86 European Competition Match Details

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the Berlin-based football club that won the last East German Cup in 1984. Search for keywords including 'East German Cup 1984 winner Berlin football club', 'DDR-Pokal 1984 final Berlin team', 'last East German Cup 1984 champion', and 'GDR Cup 1984 Berlin football'. Focus on identifying which Berlin club won this final East German Cup tournament and gather information about their European competition participation in the 1985-86 season, particularly any matches on 2 October 1985.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical match data aggregation and automated report generation for sports broadcasters
- Regulatory document monitoring and compliance requirement extraction for banking institutions
- Academic literature retrieval and meta-analysis data extraction for medical researchers
- E-commerce price tracking and competitor product feature analysis for retail pricing teams
- Security advisory crawling and vulnerability classification for cybersecurity operations centers
- Legal case law search and precedent summarization for law firm case preparation
- Social media brand mention monitoring and sentiment scoring for public relations agencies
- Post-market drug safety forum mining and adverse event categorization for pharmaceutical regulators
