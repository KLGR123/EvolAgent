This implementation conducts 10 targeted search queries to identify the main award winner (Best Game category) from the 2019 British Academy Games Awards ceremony. The search strategy includes various query formulations to capture different ways the information might be presented online, including 'Best Game winner', 'Game of the Year', and 'Outstanding Achievement' variations. Each search result is analyzed for relevance indicators like game titles, winner information, and award categories. Results are categorized and saved to workspace for detailed analysis, with immediate insights provided through quick categorization of winner information, Best Game mentions, and ceremony details. This establishes the foundation for identifying the specific game that won the main award in 2019.",

    "description": "This implementation successfully extracts the complete revision history of the God of War (2018 video game) Wikipedia page from its creation until the month before the game's release date. The approach follows a systematic two-step process:\n\n**Step 1: Release Date Identification**\n- Accesses the current Wikipedia page to extract the exact release date\n- Uses multiple methods: infobox parsing, main content search, and fallback to known date (April 20, 2018)\n- Calculates the cutoff date as the end of the month before release (March 31, 2018)\n\n**Step 2: Comprehensive Revision Extraction**\n- Uses Wikipedia API with pagination to retrieve all revisions chronologically\n- Filters revisions to include only those before the cutoff date\n- Processes up to 500 revisions per API request with respectful rate limiting\n- Extracts comprehensive metadata: timestamps, users, comments, sizes, revision IDs\n\n**Analysis and Output**\n- Provides detailed statistics on pre-release editing activity\n- Identifies top contributors and temporal distribution patterns\n- Creates multiple output formats: JSON (structured data), TXT (summary), CSV (spreadsheet)\n- Saves current Wikipedia page for reference\n\nThe implementation handles edge cases like API failures, missing data, and timestamp parsing errors. It provides comprehensive logging throughout the process and creates a complete audit trail of the extraction process. The final result answers the PLAN's core question: the total number of revisions that occurred before the game's release month, representing how much collaborative information was available on Wikipedia before God of War (2018)'s official launch.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completely fulfilled the **PLAN** requirements. The script successfully accessed the God of War (2018) Wikipedia page, extracted the exact release date (April 20, 2018), calculated the appropriate cutoff date (March 31, 2018), and retrieved the complete pre-release revision history using the Wikipedia API. The output shows **477 total revisions** were made from page creation (June 14, 2016) until the month before the game's release, involving 165 unique contributors. The code properly handled API pagination (6 requests), excluded 2,127 post-cutoff revisions, and saved comprehensive data to multiple files (JSON, TXT, CSV) in the workspace directory. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete. The answer is definitively provided: 477 revisions represent the complete Wikipedia information available before God of War's official launch. The extraction methodology was thorough and the data preservation excellent. No further development is needed - the **PLAN** objective has been fully achieved with detailed analysis and proper documentation.",
