This script: (1) Loads and validates the target image file, (2) Encodes the image in base64 format for API transmission, (3) Creates a comprehensive prompt specifically designed for bass clef music analysis covering all required elements: clef identification, staff line counting, note identification with letter names, position categorization (on lines vs in spaces), total counts, and word formation from note sequences, (4) Sends the request to GPT-4o with detailed instructions about bass clef notation (lines: G-B-D-F-A, spaces: A-C-E-G), (5) Processes and displays the complete analysis results, (6) Saves both a detailed text analysis and structured JSON summary to workspace for further processing. This approach leverages GPT-4o's visual understanding capabilities to extract all musical notation elements required by the plan, providing a foundation for subsequent analysis steps if needed.",

    "description": 'Implementation to calculate the age using the mathematical formula from the TASK based on the bass clef analysis results. This script: (1) Inspects the workspace structure and safely examines the JSON summary file without assuming key names, (2) Extracts the required values (staff lines=5, total notes=5, notes on lines=3) from the structured data, (3) Applies the mathematical formula: (staff lines + notes) - notes on lines = (5 + 5) - 3 = 7, (4) Identifies that the notes spell "DEAF" and interprets the result as someone experiencing deafness at age 7, (5) Determines the final age based on the formula result, considering typical life experiences associated with hearing loss, (6) Saves the complete calculation process and results to workspace for reference. This approach follows the plan\'s specific mathematical formula while providing clear reasoning for the age determination based on the musical notation analysis.',
