# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/8f80e01c-1296-4371-9486-bb3d68651a60.png to extract and interpret the bass clef sheet music. Identify all notes on the staff, determine their letter names using bass clef notation, count the total number of lines and notes, count specifically how many notes are positioned on staff lines (versus spaces), and spell out any word formed by the note letters in sequence.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to examine the sheet music image to understand the bass clef notation and extract all musical elements before performing any calculations, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this image file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete note identification, positioning data, and word formation from the note letters, (4) This provides the foundation needed to calculate the mathematical expression (total lines and notes minus notes on lines) and determine the age correlation as requested in the TASK

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 6: Python Script Analysis: String Array Operations from Image File data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png

**Description**: Extract and analyze the Python script from the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png to understand what operations it performs on string arrays.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated reconstruction of obfuscated URLs from archived web data for digital forensics investigations
- Dynamic generation of access links for protected resources in enterprise document management systems
- Extraction and reordering of encoded identifiers in bioinformatics pipelines for genome sequence analysis
- Restoration of original file paths from scrambled logs in cybersecurity incident response
- Custom URL creation for marketing campaigns where tracking codes are embedded via character reordering
- Decoding and validation of license keys or activation codes in software distribution workflows
- Reverse engineering of string-based puzzles or CAPTCHAs in automated testing environments
- Generating anonymized user profile links by permuting string identifiers in privacy-focused web applications

The script performs character reordering by:

- Using an array of indices (url_indices) to specify character selection order
- Joining the selected characters to form a new string
- Concatenating with a base URL prefix to create the final result

This is essentially a string permutation/reordering operation based on index mapping.

### Development Step 2: Extract Professor Willowbrook’s Recommended Calculus Midterm Reading Pages from Audio File

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached audio file data/gaia/2023/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3 to extract Professor Willowbrook's spoken instructions about recommended reading page numbers for the Calculus mid-term exam. Convert the audio to text using speech recognition, identify all mentioned page numbers or page ranges, and compile them into a complete list for study preparation.

**Use Cases**:
- University professors automating the extraction of recommended textbook page numbers from lecture recordings to generate student study guides
- Corporate training managers parsing internal webinar audio to list referenced slides and page ranges for post-session follow-up materials
- Legal teams transcribing deposition audio to index specific document page references and exhibit numbers for case preparation
- Medical educators converting conference call recordings into text to extract cited journal article pages for continuing education credits
- Textbook publishers processing author interview audio to compile page and chapter references for supplementary study guides
- E-learning platform engineers integrating audio-to-text parsing to auto-populate course modules with spoken page and section numbers
- Academic conference organizers analyzing keynote speech recordings to identify and distribute cited paper page ranges to attendees
- Religious organizations transcribing sermon audio to extract scripture passage and page references for congregational reading assignments

### Development Step 1: Excel Grid Parsing: Record Cell Coordinates, Text, Fill Colors, Identify START and END Cells

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx to extract the complete grid structure: record for each cell its row–column coordinate, displayed text, and fill color as a 6-digit hex code, then identify the coordinates of the cell containing 'START' and the cell containing 'END'.

**Use Cases**:
- Project timeline extraction for construction management: parse a color-coded Gantt chart in Excel to import each task’s grid position, label, and scheduling colors, then automatically locate the “START” kickoff milestone and “END” completion point.
- Retail shelf planogram automation: extract the full store shelving grid with product names and color-coded stock levels from an Excel layout, identify the beginning (“START”) and end (“END”) of each aisle for dynamic planogram updates.
- AGV navigation map generation in manufacturing: read an Excel-based factory floor grid with zones highlighted by fill color, output precise coordinates for every cell, and locate the “START” docking station and “END” delivery bay for autonomous guided vehicles.
- Classroom seating performance analysis: parse a teacher’s Excel seating chart where student names and test scores are color-coded, record each desk’s coordinates and find designated “START” and “END” rows for group activities arrangement.
- Game level prototyping: convert a level design represented in Excel cells (with obstacles and power-ups color-coded) into JSON; pinpoint the “START” spawn cell and “END” exit cell for rapid engine import.
- Real estate floorplan digitization: extract room labels, dimensions, and color-coded zones (e.g., living, kitchen, bedrooms) from an Excel blueprint, capturing each cell’s coordinates and fill color, then identify the main “START” entrance and emergency “END” exits.
- High-throughput screening data mapping in biotech: interpret a microtiter plate layout from Excel, record each well’s row–column address, sample identifier, and color-coded assay result, and locate the “START” reference well and “END” control well for automated analysis.

- Academic researchers recovering and analyzing code snippets from published figures or images in scientific papers to reproduce computational experiments
- Automated QA systems validating that documentation screenshots of code match the actual source code by extracting and comparing scripts
- Business analysts retrieving and verifying configuration scripts from archived image files in legacy system audits
- Cybersecurity professionals decoding and tracing suspicious links hidden in image-based phishing emails for incident response
- Software engineers reverse-engineering application logic from UI screenshots when source code is unavailable for legacy migration projects
- Compliance officers extracting and reviewing code from image-based evidence in regulatory investigations to ensure adherence to coding standards

### Development Step 1: Extract Professor’s Anagram Question and Criteria from Attached Audio File for Analysis

**Description**: Analyze the attached audio file data/gaia/2023/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3 to extract the professor's anagram question. Listen to the recording to understand what original line or phrase needs to be rearranged into an anagram, and identify the specific request or criteria the professor mentioned for creating the anagram.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated extraction of professor’s anagram questions from recorded university lectures to streamline quiz creation for teaching assistants
- Transcribing and analyzing audio submissions in online language puzzle competitions to verify original phrases and challenge criteria
- Processing customer service training recordings to identify and catalog wordplay exercises for employee skill assessments
- Digitizing and indexing audio-based puzzle content for educational game developers to facilitate rapid content generation
- Reviewing and summarizing podcast segments containing word games or anagram challenges for content curation teams
- Assisting accessibility teams by converting spoken anagram instructions in classroom recordings into readable text for students with hearing impairments
- Archiving and analyzing audio interviews with puzzle creators to extract and document anagram challenge instructions for publication
- Automating the extraction and organization of spoken word puzzles from radio broadcasts for trivia database enrichment
