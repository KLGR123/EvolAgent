This script: (1) Loads and validates the target image file, (2) Encodes the image in base64 format for API transmission, (3) Creates a comprehensive prompt specifically designed for bass clef music analysis covering all required elements: clef identification, staff line counting, note identification with letter names, position categorization (on lines vs in spaces), total counts, and word formation from note sequences, (4) Sends the request to GPT-4o with detailed instructions about bass clef notation (lines: G-B-D-F-A, spaces: A-C-E-G), (5) Processes and displays the complete analysis results, (6) Saves both a detailed text analysis and structured JSON summary to workspace for further processing. This approach leverages GPT-4o's visual understanding capabilities to extract all musical notation elements required by the plan, providing a foundation for subsequent analysis steps if needed.",
