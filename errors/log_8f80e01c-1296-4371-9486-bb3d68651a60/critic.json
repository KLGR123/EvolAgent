  "reason": "Task decomposition: Analyze bass clef sheet music to identify notes, count lines/notes, determine note positions, spell word from note letters, and calculate age using formula (total lines + notes) - (notes on lines). Individual member evaluation: Member 1 identified notes as A-B-D-E-G spelling 'DEBAG' with 3 notes on lines, calculating age 15 using multiplication rather than the specified subtraction formula. Member 2 provided most systematic analysis identifying notes as B-A-D-C-E spelling 'BADCE' with 2 notes on lines, correctly applying formula (5+5)-2=8. Member 3 identified notes as D-F-A-E-G spelling 'DEAF' with 3 notes on lines, calculating (5+5)-3=7. Cross-analysis reveals significant divergence in note identification, indicating need for careful verification. Member 2 demonstrated superior methodological rigor by: (1) providing detailed correction process when discrepancies were found, (2) explicitly documenting position verification for each note, (3) correctly applying the subtraction formula as specified in task, (4) showing systematic error correction methodology. Convergence on 5 staff lines and 5 total notes across all members provides confidence in these counts. Resolution of contradictions: Member 2's approach included explicit correction of initial analysis errors and detailed verification steps, suggesting higher reliability. Integration assessment: Member 2's calculation of 8 years represents the most methodologically sound approach with proper formula application and systematic verification process.",
