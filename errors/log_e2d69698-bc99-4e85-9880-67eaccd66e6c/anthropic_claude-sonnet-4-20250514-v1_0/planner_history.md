    "plan": "Search for comprehensive information about US Survivor winners and their birth dates, focusing on identifying any winners born in May. Use multiple search approaches including: (1) Wikipedia's list of Survivor winners with biographical data, (2) CBS Survivor official resources, (3) Reality TV databases that track contestant information, (4) Fan sites with detailed Survivor winner profiles. Extract winner names, seasons, and birth dates (month/day/year) to identify all contestants born in May. Cross-reference multiple sources to ensure accuracy and completeness of birth date information.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to establish a comprehensive dataset of US Survivor winners and their birth dates to identify May births, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to locate authoritative sources listing Survivor winners with complete birth date information, (4) This directly addresses the TASK by systematically gathering the data needed to identify any winner born in May and determine if there is only one such winner as of August 2023.',

    "description": 'The PLAN objective has been successfully completed.

    "plan": 'Expand the search to cover all remaining US Survivor winners (seasons 24-46) to verify that Kim Spradlin is indeed the only winner born in May. The current research only covered 23 out of 46 winners (52.3% completion), so we need to search the remaining winners from more recent seasons to ensure completeness and accuracy of the final answer.',
    "description": "This plan is necessary because: (1) The previous search identified Kim Spradlin (Season 24, born May 13, 1982) as a May-born winner but only covered 23 of 46 total US Survivor winners, (2) To definitively answer that she is the 'only' winner born in May as of August 2023, we must verify all remaining winners from seasons not yet researched, (3) Expected outcome is complete birth date data for all US Survivor winners through Season 46 (which aired by August 2023), (4) This ensures our final answer is comprehensive and accurate by confirming no other May-born winners exist among the unresearched seasons.",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted in the HISTORY, the developer systematically searched birth dates for 43 out of 45 US Survivor winners (95.6% completion) through Season 46, which covers all seasons that aired by August 2023. The research definitively found that there are 6 US Survivor winners born in May, not just one: Kim Spradlin (May 13, Season 24), Michele Fitzgerald (May 18, Season 32), Wendell Holland (May 23, Season 36), Chris Underwood (May 15, Season 38), Yam Yam Arocho (May 24, Season 44), and Kenzie Petty (May 22, Season 46). Therefore, the premise of the question is incorrect - there is no single 'only winner' born in May. Final answer: The question's premise is false; there are 6 US Survivor winners born in May, not just one.",
