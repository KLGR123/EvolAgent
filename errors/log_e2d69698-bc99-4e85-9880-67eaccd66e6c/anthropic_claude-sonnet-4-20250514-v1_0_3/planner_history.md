    "plan": "Search for comprehensive information about US Survivor winners and their birth months, focusing on identifying any winners born in May. Use reliable sources such as Wikipedia's list of Survivor winners, CBS official records, or Survivor fan databases to compile winner names, seasons, and birth dates. Look for patterns or specific mentions of May birthdays among the winner roster from Seasons 1 through the most recent season available as of August 2023.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to establish a complete dataset of US Survivor winners and their birth information to identify May births, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet according to the empty HISTORY, (3) Expected outcome is to locate authoritative sources listing Survivor winners with birth month data, enabling identification of any May-born winners, (4) This directly targets the core question about finding the unique May-born winner among all US Survivor contestants who won their respective seasons',
