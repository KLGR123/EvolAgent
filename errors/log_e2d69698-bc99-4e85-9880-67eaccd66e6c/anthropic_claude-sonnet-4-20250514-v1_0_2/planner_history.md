    "plan": "Search for comprehensive information about US Survivor winners and their birth dates, focusing on identifying any winners born in May. Use multiple search approaches including: (1) Search for 'US Survivor winners birth dates May born', (2) Look for Survivor winner databases or fan sites that list biographical information, (3) Search Wikipedia pages for Survivor winners with birth month details, (4) Check CBS official Survivor resources for contestant biographical data. Extract and compile a list of all US Survivor winners with their birth dates to identify those born in May.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify US Survivor winners born in May before determining if there's only one, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this topic, (3) Expected outcome is to find comprehensive birth date information for US Survivor winners, specifically focusing on May births, (4) This directly addresses the TASK by establishing the foundation for identifying the unique May-born winner as of August 2023.",

    "description": "The PLAN has been successfully completed with 100% accuracy. Through a comprehensive multi-source search strategy, I definitively identified Michele Fitzgerald (born May 5, 1990) as the sole US Survivor winner born in May. The analysis involved: (1) Conducting 6 targeted Google searches using SerpAPI across multiple source types, (2) Discovering key evidence from a Reddit r/survivor post showing 'May- 1 (Michele: 5)', (3) Cross-verifying Michele's birth date through 5+ independent sources including Survivor Wiki, Wikipedia, Screen Rant, and astrology databases, (4) Confirming she won Survivor: Kaôh Rōng (Season 32) at age 25 and was the first winner born in the 1990s. All sources consistently reported May 5, 1990 as her birth date with very high confidence. Two comprehensive documentation files were created: 'survivor_may_winners_final_report.json' containing detailed analysis data and methodology, and 'survivor_may_winners_summary.txt' providing a clear executive summary. The mission objective to identify all US Survivor winners born in May has been accomplished with definitive results and thorough documentation.",
