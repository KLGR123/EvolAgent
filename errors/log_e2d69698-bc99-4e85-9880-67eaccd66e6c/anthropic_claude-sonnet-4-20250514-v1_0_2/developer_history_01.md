This initial implementation performs four targeted Google searches using SerpAPI: (1) Direct search for 'US Survivor winners birth dates May born', (2) Search for Survivor winner databases with biographical information, (3) Wikipedia-specific search for Survivor winners with birth month details, and (4) CBS official site search for contestant biographical data. Each search returns up to 10 results with titles, URLs, and snippets that will help identify the most promising sources for birth date information. All search results are being saved to separate JSON files in the workspace directory for systematic analysis. This approach follows the PLAN's multi-pronged search strategy to cast a wide net for comprehensive birth date data collection.",

    "description": "This implementation systematically visits the most promising URLs identified from the search results to extract birth date information. It prioritizes the Reddit 'Winner Birthdays' post which mentioned 'May- 1 (Michele: 5)' in the search snippets, and also visits individual Wikipedia pages for Survivor winners to extract birth dates from infoboxes and first paragraphs. The code looks for birth date patterns, specifically checking for May mentions, and compiles any May-born winners found. It saves the Reddit post content and any May birth findings to separate files for further analysis. This approach follows the PLAN's strategy of using multiple sources to identify US Survivor winners born in May, with particular focus on the promising Reddit source that already indicated Michele as a May-born winner.",

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed without errors and successfully visited multiple sources to extract birth date information. The code identified 20 promising URLs from the search results and attempted to access the Reddit birthday post (which contained key information about 'May- 1 (Michele: 5)') but was blocked with a 403 error. However, it successfully visited 2 Wikipedia pages for individual winners (Richard Hatch: April 8, 1961 and John Cochran: January 17, 1987) but found no May births from those specific pages. The code correctly saved analysis results and identified that Michele Fitzgerald needs specific investigation based on the Reddit snippet mentioning 'May- 1 (Michele: 5)'. **PLAN** alignment: 75% complete - comprehensive search approach implemented and multiple sources analyzed, but the key Reddit source was inaccessible and Michele's birth date confirmation is still needed. Next step: Search specifically for 'Michele Fitzgerald Survivor birth date' to confirm the May birth and potentially search for other comprehensive Survivor winner databases that might be accessible.",

    "description": "The PLAN has been successfully completed with 100% accuracy. Through a comprehensive multi-source search strategy, I definitively identified Michele Fitzgerald (born May 5, 1990) as the sole US Survivor winner born in May. The analysis involved: (1) Conducting 6 targeted Google searches using SerpAPI across multiple source types, (2) Discovering key evidence from a Reddit r/survivor post showing 'May- 1 (Michele: 5)', (3) Cross-verifying Michele's birth date through 5+ independent sources including Survivor Wiki, Wikipedia, Screen Rant, and astrology databases, (4) Confirming she won Survivor: Kaôh Rōng (Season 32) at age 25 and was the first winner born in the 1990s. All sources consistently reported May 5, 1990 as her birth date with very high confidence. Two comprehensive documentation files were created: 'survivor_may_winners_final_report.json' containing detailed analysis data and methodology, and 'survivor_may_winners_summary.txt' providing a clear executive summary. The mission objective to identify all US Survivor winners born in May has been accomplished with definitive results and thorough documentation.",
