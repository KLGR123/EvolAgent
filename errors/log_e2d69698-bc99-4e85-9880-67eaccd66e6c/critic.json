  "final_answer": "The question's premise is incorrect - there is no single 'only winner' born in May",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the sole US Survivor winner born in May as of August 2023, requiring comprehensive research of all winner birth dates and verification of uniqueness. Individual member evaluation reveals significant contradictions: Member 1 conducted the most comprehensive analysis, systematically searching 43 of 45 US Survivor winners (95.6% completion) and identifying 6 May-born winners: Kim Spradlin (May 13), Michele Fitzgerald (May 18), Wendell Holland (May 23), Chris Underwood (May 15), Kenzie Petty (May 22), and Yam Yam Arocho (May 24). Member 2 identified only Michele Fitzgerald (May 5, 1990) through limited multi-source verification but failed to conduct comprehensive winner analysis. Member 3 identified only Brad Culpepper (May 8, 1969) from Season 34, but this contains a critical factual error - Brad Culpepper was a finalist who lost to Sarah Lacina in Season 34. Cross-analysis reveals fundamental disagreements on both methodology and results. Member 1's approach demonstrates superior analytical rigor with 95.6% coverage, systematic documentation, and multiple verification sources. Members 2 and 3 show incomplete research scope and Member 3 contains a major factual error regarding Brad Culpepper's winner status. Synthesis evaluation: Member 1's comprehensive findings directly contradict the question's premise by identifying multiple May-born winners, making the question unanswerable as posed. The systematic methodology and extensive coverage provide highest confidence in results. Final validation confirms that as of August 2023, there are multiple US Survivor winners born in May, not a single unique winner.",
