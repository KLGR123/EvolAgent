# Planner Initialization

## Task
The work referenced in footnote 397 of Federico Lauria's 2014 dissertation is also the source for the titles of two paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection, as of August 2023. What is the absolute difference between the chapter numbers of the chapters that the titles of these two paintings quote?

## Episodic Examples
### Identify Author Influencing Neurologist’s Belief in “Endopsychic Myths” (Chapter 2, DOI 10.1353/book.24372)

**TASK**: The book with the doi 10.1353/book.24372 concerns a certain neurologist. According to chapter 2 of the book, what author influenced this neurologist’s belief in “endopsychic myths”? Give the last name only.

### Fact-Checking Greetham Citation: Verifying Quoted Passage from ‘Uncoupled’ Article

**TASK**: I need to fact-check a citation. This is the citation from the bibliography:

Greetham, David. "Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)." Textual Cultures: Texts, Contexts, Interpretation, vol. 3 no. 1, 2008, p. 45-46. Project MUSE, doi:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44.

And this is the in-line citation:

Our relationship with the authors of the works we read can often be “obscured not by a "cloak of print" but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission” (Greetham 45-46).

Does the quoted text match what is actually in the article? If Yes, answer Yes, otherwise, give me the word in my citation that does not match with the correct one (without any article).

### Identify weight and adjacent-column swap causing checksum errors in modified ISBN-13 numbers

**TASK**: The following numbers function similarly to ISBN 13 numbers, however, their validation methods are slightly different. Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.
