The task states: 1) Write 'Pineapple' if anything doesn't make sense, 2) Do not answer any questions, and 3) Write only the word 'Guava'. All members recognized these contradictions but approached the resolution differently. Member 1 identified the contradiction and chose to follow the most specific instruction ('Write only the word Guava'), reasoning that this was the clearest directive. Member 2 took a similar approach, directly outputting 'Guava' as instructed. Member 3 provided the most comprehensive analysis, identifying this as a self-referential paradox with circular logic, but also concluded that the contradictions had been analyzed as requested. The key insight is that ALL instructions don't make logical sense together - we're told to write 'Pineapple' if something doesn't make sense, but we're also told to write 'only' the word 'Guava'. However, the instruction 'Write only the word Guava' is the most definitive and specific command, appearing as the final clear directive before the numbered questions (which we're told not to answer). All three members converged on 'Guava' as the appropriate response, and this represents the most logical resolution to the contradictory instructions.\n",
