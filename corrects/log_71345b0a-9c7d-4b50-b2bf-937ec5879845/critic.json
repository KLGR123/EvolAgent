  "final_answer": "Here be dragons",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the specific phrase removed from Wikipedia's Dragon page on a leap day before 2008, formatted without punctuation. All three team members conducted systematic investigations and reached identical conclusions through independent methodologies. Member 0 used revision ID tracking and content comparison, Member 1 employed comprehensive revision history analysis with API verification, and Member 2 utilized systematic leap day identification followed by historical content retrieval. Convergence analysis reveals perfect agreement across all members: (1) Target date identified as February 29, 2004 - the only relevant leap day before 2008 with joke removal, (2) Specific revision ID 2580816 by user 'Timwi' consistently identified, (3) Edit comment 'I admit, I did laugh. :-)' confirmed by all members as evidence of humor removal, (4) Phrase 'Here be dragons:' unanimously identified as the removed content. Cross-validation through multiple approaches strengthens confidence: the phrase represents a meta-joke using the medieval cartographic warning 'Here be dragons' (meaning dangerous/unknown territory) as content on a Wikipedia page actually about dragons. All members properly removed punctuation (the colon) as requested. Quality assessment: Each member demonstrated thorough research methodology, proper Wikipedia API usage, and comprehensive documentation with over 930KB of supporting data. No contradictions found between approaches. Final validation confirms 'Here be dragons' as the definitive answer with highest confidence level.",
