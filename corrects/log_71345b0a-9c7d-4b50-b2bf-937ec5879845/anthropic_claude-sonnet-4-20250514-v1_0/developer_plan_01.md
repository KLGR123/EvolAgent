# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for Wikipedia revision history of the 'Dragon' page to identify edits made on leap days (February 29) before 2008. Focus on February 29, 2000 and February 29, 2004 as the only leap days in that timeframe. Look for edit summaries or revision comparisons that mention joke removal, humor deletion, or similar content changes. Extract the specific revision data showing what content was removed on those dates.

## Description
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific leap day before 2008 when a joke was removed from the Dragon Wikipedia page, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate Wikipedia's revision history for the Dragon page and identify edits on February 29, 2000 or February 29, 2004 that involved joke removal, (4) This establishes the foundation for finding the exact phrase that was deleted from the page.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 40: Extract common disparaging word from dragon portrayal quotes in Emily Midkiff’s June 2014 Fafnir article

**Description**: Access Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the Fafnir journal to extract the full text and identify the specific word that was quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions. Parse the article content systematically to locate quotes from multiple authors that contain the same critical word about dragon portrayals.

**Use Cases**:
- Literary criticism archiving: Automatically extract and collate critical adjectives from fantasy journals to build a reference of scholarly sentiment on dragon characters for an author writing a meta-analysis
- Higher education course preparation: Pull out recurring critical terms from Midkiff’s Fafnir article to create lecture slides on contemporary scholarly critiques of mythic creatures
- Digital humanities project: Process a corpus of mythology journals to identify and compare key negative descriptors of dragons across different time periods
- Publishing industry fact-checking: Scan submitted dragon-focused manuscripts to ensure authors accurately reference and quote established criticism from academic sources
- AI-driven content moderation: Train a model to detect and flag overly critical or negative language in user-generated fantasy lore based on extracted keywords from scholarly texts
- Museum exhibit curation: Extract and summarize critical terms from historical and modern scholarship to craft exhibit labels that challenge or reinforce public perceptions of dragons
- Online encyclopedia updating: Automatically detect and update entries with historically significant critical quotes about dragons to maintain scholarly accuracy in mythological articles

```

### Development Step 9: Filter Wikipedia Revisions from Inception to June 30, 2023, and Count All Edits

**Description**: Filter the extracted revision data from the comprehensive Wikipedia history to count only the edits made from the page's inception until the end of June 2023. Exclude any revisions that occurred after June 30, 2023, and provide the exact count of edits within the specified timeframe.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical audit of a high-traffic political article to report the exact number of edits from its creation through June 30, 2023 for a government transparency review
- Legal compliance verification of a corporate product documentation page by counting all edits made before the July 2023 launch cutoff
- Academic analysis of contributor activity on the “Climate Change” Wikipedia entry up to June 30, 2023 to correlate edit bursts with major IPCC report releases
- Data journalism investigation tracking the volume of corrections on COVID-19–related pages from inception until mid-2023 to illustrate information stability
- Software documentation freeze monitoring by tallying updates to the “Docker” page before the June 2023 feature-freeze deadline for release planning
- Competitive market research quantifying revision counts on flagship smartphone pages through June 2023 to benchmark public interest trends
- Non-profit grant application support by auditing edits made to the NGO’s mission statement article up to June 2023 funding deadline

### Development Step 4: Extract July 3 2023 LOTR Wikipedia Internal Links Toward A Song of Ice and Fire

**Description**: Access the archived Wikipedia page for 'The Lord of the Rings' (book) as it appeared at the end of July 3, 2023. Use the Wayback Machine or Wikipedia's revision history to retrieve the specific version from that date. Extract all outbound links from the page content, focusing on internal Wikipedia links that could potentially lead toward 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. Create a comprehensive list of linked pages including literature, fantasy, author, publisher, and genre-related links that might serve as stepping stones in the path-finding process.

**Use Cases**:
- Competitive product mapping for market intelligence teams: archive the Wikipedia page of a rival’s flagship product, extract outbound links, and use BFS to uncover related technologies and collaborators leading to a specific emerging competitor.
- Academic literature exploration for research librarians: retrieve an archived revision of a foundational theory page, scrape internal links, and trace a path through related journals and authors to locate a target contemporary study.
- SEO internal linking audit for digital marketing agencies: load a historical snapshot of a high-traffic Wikipedia article, extract its link network, and identify the shortest chain of links that leads to pages optimized for a target keyword.
- Educational curriculum design for e-learning platforms: access the archived “Introduction to Biology” page, gather its outbound topic links, and map a learning path toward advanced genetics content using breadth-first search.
- Historical content evolution analysis for digital archivists: pull the July 2023 version of a political event page, extract links, and reconstruct how references to a specific legislation article appeared over time by finding link paths.
- Knowledge graph augmentation for AI research teams: scrape a past revision of an ontology page, collect entity links, and build a linkage chain to a new domain-specific concept to enrich the graph with contextual relationships.
- Due diligence support for consulting firms: obtain an archived corporate biography page, scrape its network of partner and subsidiary links, and run BFS to identify the shortest route to a target industry regulation page.

### Development Step 18: Search Emily Midkiff’s June 2014 Dragon Depictions Article to Find Hreidmar Son-Named Journal

**Description**: Search for information about Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article, focusing on identifying the journal named after one of Hreidmar's sons from Norse mythology. Research Hreidmar's sons (Fafnir, Regin, and Otr) to determine which one has a journal named after them, then locate Midkiff's specific article from June 2014 that discusses dragon depictions and contains quotes from two different authors expressing distaste.

**Use Cases**:
- A Norse mythology scholar automating the extraction of Fafnir journal links from saved HTML search results to compile all June 2014 articles on dragon symbolism for a comprehensive literature review
- A university librarian processing archived web dumps of Fafnir to generate a JSON inventory of articles and metadata, streamlining the cataloguing of early 2010s journal issues in the institutional repository
- A PhD candidate in medieval studies using the script to locate Emily Midkiff’s June 2014 discussion on dragon depictions, quickly gathering author quotes expressing distaste for critical analysis in their dissertation
- A digital archivist at a cultural heritage center harvesting and cross‐referencing article URLs and key term counts from multiple search result files to build a searchable database of primary sources on mythological creatures
- A metadata specialist at an academic publisher automating link extraction and term frequency analysis for back‐issue content of Fafnir, integrating the results into the content management system for author and topic indexing
- An AI research assistant fixing variable scope issues in a scraper pipeline to analyze saved search pages, extract relevant academic links, and produce structured JSON inventories for downstream NLP processing
- A competitive intelligence analyst at a media monitoring agency extracting and analyzing historical references to “dragon depictions” across archival HTML files to track sentiment trends and author stances in niche publications
- A software QA engineer validating web scraping workflows by injecting pre-saved search and archive HTML pages, verifying link extraction accuracy, JSON output integrity, and bug fixes for reliable data pipeline operation
