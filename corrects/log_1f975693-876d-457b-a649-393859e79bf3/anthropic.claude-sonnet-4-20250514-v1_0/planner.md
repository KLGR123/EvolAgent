## Task Description
```
Hi, I was out sick from my classes on Friday, so I'm trying to figure out what I need to study for my Calculus mid-term next week. My friend from class sent me an audio recording of Professor Willowbrook giving out the recommended reading for the test, but my headphones are broken :(

Could you please listen to the recording for me and tell me the page numbers I'm supposed to go over? I've attached a file called Homework.mp3 that has the recording. Please provide just the page numbers as a comma-delimited list. And please provide the list in ascending order. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3

### Find Vendor with Lowest Revenue-to-Rent Ratio and Provide Its Type

**TASK**: The attached file contains a list of vendors in the Liminal Springs mall, along with each vendor’s monthly revenue and the rent they pay the mall. I want you to find the vendor that makes the least money, relative to the rent it pays. Then, tell me what is listed in the “type” column for that vendor.

Any other value (-100 to 100, excluding 0) causes an `UhOh` exception and retry.\n\n**FINAL NUMERIC OUTPUT: 0**\n\nThe program will always output `0` because:\n- The retry loop continues indefinitely until `Yeah()` returns `True`\n- `Yeah()` only returns `True` when `self.value == 0`\n- When this condition is met, `keep_trying()` returns `maybe.value` (which is 0)\n- The main execution prints this returned value\n\nThe randomness in `randint(-100, 100)` only affects how many iterations it takes to find a 0, but the final output is deterministic: it will always be 0. The program essentially implements a probabilistic search for the value 0 among random integers, and once found, that's the value it outputs.\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `workspace/target_python_code.py`: Complete copy of the analyzed code\n- `workspace/code_execution_analysis.txt`: Detailed analysis documentation\n\n**Task Status**: COMPLETE - Successfully parsed the Python code, traced its execution logic, and determined the final numeric output is 0.",

### Find minimum cell towers to cover all houses within 4-mile road radius.

**TASK**: You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. In the reference file is a layout of the road and nearby houses. Each dash, "-", is a marker indicating a mile. Each capital H indicates a house located next to a mile marker, appearing above or below the stretch of road. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt
