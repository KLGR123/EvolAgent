## Task Description
```
After a stage of the 2005 Tour de France, which had Robbie McEwen as the sprint finish winner and included a breakaway rider who rode solo for 160km, in the general classification:

The rider who holds the record for the most Tour de France participations, is of the same nationality as the winner of the women's individual time trial at the World Road Racing Championship (which was the first to include the women's individual time trial), and rode for the team that was later rebranded to the team of the 2008 Tour de France winner, is behind another rider by how many seconds?

This other rider also holds the record for most Tour de France participations, is of the same nationality, won the men's road race at the World Road Racing Championship (which was the first to include the women's team time trial), won the overall classification of the Tour DuPont that was the first to include a route through South Carolina, and was the first American to win that World Championship.

Given that the points classification was led by a German rider, by how many seconds is the first rider behind the second rider?

### Calculate 2011 Bulgarian Census Tertiary Education Gender Gap in Thousands

**TASK**: Take the gender split from the 2011 Bulgarian census about those who have completed tertiary education. Subtract the smaller number from the larger number, then return the difference in thousands of women. So if there were 30.1 thousand more men, you'd give "30.1"
