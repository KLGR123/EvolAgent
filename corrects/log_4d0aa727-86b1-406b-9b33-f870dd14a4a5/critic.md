## Final Answer
```
1 in 3
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Calculate the probability that the Sunset Picnic Trip will use a steam locomotive, expressed as odds. All three team members conducted thorough analyses of the Excel file and reached consistent conclusions. Member 1 analyzed the locomotive data and identified exactly 3 locomotives assigned to the Sunset Picnic Trip: one steam locomotive (#1060 with 0-4-0 wheel configuration) and two diesel locomotives (#93 with NW2 designation and #57 with GP30 designation). Member 2 similarly identified 3 locomotives for the Sunset Picnic Trip with 1 being steam, resulting in a proportion of 1/3. Member 3 independently reached the same conclusion, identifying the same three locomotives (#1060 steam, #93 diesel, #57 diesel) assigned to the Sunset Picnic Trip. Convergence analysis shows perfect agreement among all team members on both the total number of locomotives (3) and the number of steam locomotives (1) assigned to the Sunset Picnic Trip. The methodology used by all members was appropriate: extract locomotive data from the Excel file, identify those assigned to the Sunset Picnic Trip, classify them by type, and calculate the probability. The requirement to express the answer as odds in the form '1 in X' results in the final answer of '1 in 3', representing the odds that today's Sunset Picnic Trip will use a steam locomotive. This answer has high confidence due to the unanimous agreement across all three independent analyses.
