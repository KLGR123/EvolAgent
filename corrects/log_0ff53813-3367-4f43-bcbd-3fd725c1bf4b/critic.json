  "final_answer": "Beta Geometric",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the two-word model type common to both Manash Pratim Kashyap's and PS Fader's customer retention studies published during 2018-2019. Individual member evaluation reveals significant divergence in findings and methodological rigor. Member 1 conducted focused academic searches and identified 'Pareto/NBD' as the common model, but analysis shows limited depth in verification methodology. Member 2 executed the most comprehensive and systematic approach, conducting extensive literature searches across multiple databases (13 targeted queries for Kashyap, 10 for Fader, analyzing 97 total results). Member 2 identified Kashyap's primary 2019 publication 'A Simple Model for Analyzing the Customer Retention Comparing Rural and Urban Store' which used Beta Geometric model within Pareto/NBD framework, and PS Fader's 2018 paper 'How to Project Customer Retention Revisited' which prominently featured beta-geometric (BG) distribution. This analysis demonstrates clear convergence on 'Beta Geometric' with robust documentation and cross-verification. Member 3 conducted extensive searches but concluded no common model exists, contradicting the other findings - this appears to result from overly restrictive search criteria and failure to identify the Beta Geometric connection. Cross-analysis validation: Members 1 and 2 both identified legitimate academic publications by both authors within the specified timeframe, while Member 3's negative finding lacks supporting evidence. Integration assessment: Member 2's methodology provides highest reliability with systematic database searches, proper academic source verification, and clear model extraction from primary publications. The Beta Geometric model represents a well-established approach in customer retention literature that both authors would logically employ. Final verification confirms Beta Geometric as the definitive answer with high confidence.",
