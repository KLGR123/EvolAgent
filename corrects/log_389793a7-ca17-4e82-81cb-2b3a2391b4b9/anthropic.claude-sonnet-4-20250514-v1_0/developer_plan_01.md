# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-28 18:06:01

## Plan Content
```
Parse and analyze the attached file data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt to understand the road layout, house positions, and mile markers. Extract the visual representation of the road stretch showing dashes (-) as mile markers and capital H letters representing house locations above or below the road.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the specific layout and house positions from the provided file before calculating tower placement, (2) No previous analysis has been conducted on the attached file, (3) Expected outcome is to extract the road map data and identify all house locations relative to mile markers, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to solve the tower coverage optimization problem with the 4-mile radius constraint.
```

The output clearly shows a 3-line visual representation: Line 1 contains houses (H) above the road, Line 2 shows the road with dashes (-) as mile markers (32 total), and Line 3 shows houses (H) below the road (7 houses total). The code successfully extracted and analyzed the visual representation, identified the key components (dashes as mile markers, capital H as house locations), and saved the raw content to workspace for future reference. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all requirements met (road layout parsed, house positions identified, mile markers extracted, visual representation understood). The analysis provides exact counts and structure details needed. No further development is required.',
