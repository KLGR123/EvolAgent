# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-28 18:06:48

## Plan Content
```
Map each house to its exact mile position by analyzing the character positions in the road layout from workspace/road_layout_raw.txt. Calculate the precise mile marker location for each of the 7 houses (3 above the road, 4 below the road) by correlating their horizontal positions with the corresponding dash positions in the 32-mile road stretch.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have the visual layout parsed but need precise mile positions for each house to calculate optimal tower placement, (2) Previous analysis identified 7 houses and 32 mile markers but didn't map house positions to specific miles, (3) Expected outcome is to create a list of exact mile positions where houses are located, (4) This positioning data is essential for applying the 4-mile radius coverage constraint and solving the minimum tower placement optimization problem.
