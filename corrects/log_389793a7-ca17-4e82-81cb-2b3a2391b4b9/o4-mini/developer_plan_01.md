# Developer Plan #1 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-28 18:09:32

## Plan Content
```
Read the file data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt, parse each column across the three-line layout to collect mile marker indices where either the top or bottom line has an 'H', sort the list of house indices, then apply a greedy interval covering algorithm that repeatedly takes the smallest uncovered index p, places a tower at p+4 (covering [p, p+8]), removes all indices ≤ p+8, increments a tower counter, and finally returns the counter as the minimum number of towers needed.
```

## Plan Description
```
This plan is optimal because: (1) It begins by extracting all house locations directly from the provided layout file, (2) Sorting and greedy covering solves the classic interval coverage problem efficiently, (3) The expected outcome is a single integer equal to the minimum number of towers, (4) This directly completes the TASK of determining how many 4-mile-radius towers are required to cover every house.

    "description": "Implementation rationale:\n(1) We read the three-line layout from the read-only file in data/gaia/... into `raw_lines`, filtering empty lines to isolate the top, middle, and bottom rows.\n(2) We verify that at least three non-empty lines exist, then extract `top_line` and `bot_line`, warning if they differ in length.\n(3) We iterate over columns 0..width-1, collecting indices where `top_line[idx] == 'H'` or `bot_line[idx] == 'H'` into `house_positions`.\n(4) After sorting these mile marker indices, we apply the greedy covering algorithm: take the smallest uncovered house `p`, place a tower at `p+4` covering `[p, p+8]`, skip all covered houses, and repeat until done.\n(5) Throughout, verbose `print()` statements display file lengths, parsing progress, found house positions, each tower placement, covered houses, and the final required tower count.\nThis fulfills the PLAN by computing and printing the minimum number of towers needed to cover all houses in the layout.",
