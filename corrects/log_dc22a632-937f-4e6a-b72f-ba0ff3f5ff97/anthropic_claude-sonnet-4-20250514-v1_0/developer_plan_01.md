# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for information about Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show that started in 2015, focusing on identifying the show name and finding episodes where he visits New Mexican restaurants. Look for specific episodes featuring New Mexican cuisine staples like green chile dishes, sopapillas, or other regional specialties, and identify which restaurant he visited that was later recommended by James Beard Award winners in a book.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify Ali Khan's 2015 TV show and find the specific episode featuring New Mexican cuisine, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the show name, episode details, and the New Mexican restaurant he visited, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to then search for the book by James Beard Award winners that recommended this same restaurant
