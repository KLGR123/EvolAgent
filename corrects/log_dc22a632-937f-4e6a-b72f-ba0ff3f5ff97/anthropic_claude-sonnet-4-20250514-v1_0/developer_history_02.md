While it started correctly by searching for Papa Felipe's James Beard connections, the actual output shows completely unrelated content about Girls Who Code statistics and HTML file analysis. This suggests there was a significant execution error or data contamination that prevented the intended search from running properly. The code structure looked correct for searching Papa Felipe's connection to James Beard Award winners' books, but none of those search results are visible in the output. **PLAN** alignment: 0% for this iteration - no relevant search results obtained due to execution issues. However, based on previous successful searches, we know: Show = Cheap Eats, Episode = Season 1 Episode 3 Albuquerque, Restaurant = Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant, Dish = sopaipilla stuffed with carne adovada. Recommended fix: Re-run the search focusing specifically on Papa Felipe's James Beard connections, or manually verify if Papa Felipe's appears in Cheryl Jamison's 'I Love New Mexico Food' cookbook that was identified in previous searches.",
