# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Research Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show that started in 2015 to identify the specific show name, then find episodes where he visited New Mexico or enjoyed New Mexican cuisine. Focus on identifying which restaurant he visited that served a New Mexican staple dish, and determine if this restaurant was recommended by James Beard Award winners in a book. Extract the complete title of that book, ensuring any numbers in the title are written in plain text format.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify Ali Khan's 2015 TV show and locate episodes featuring New Mexican cuisine to find the specific restaurant visit, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this multi-layered query, (3) Expected outcome is to establish the show name and identify the New Mexican restaurant visit that connects to James Beard Award winners' book recommendation, (4) This systematic approach will build the foundation needed to trace the connection from TV show to restaurant to book title as required by the TASK
