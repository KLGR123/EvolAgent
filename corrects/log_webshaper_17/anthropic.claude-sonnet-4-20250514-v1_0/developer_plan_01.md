# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_17  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-07 02:55:21

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about reality dating shows that feature elimination rounds with exactly four contestants progressing through three stages. Focus on identifying shows with this specific format structure and then determine which artists/musicians participated in these shows as contestants.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) The TASK requires identifying a specific reality dating show format with very particular criteria (four contestants, three stages, elimination rounds), (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific reality dating show(s) that match this format and create a list of potential shows to investigate further, (4) This systematic approach will help narrow down which artists participated in shows with this exact structure before researching their solo album debut years

### Development Step 28: Extract Survivor Seasons 1–44 Winners into workspace JSON file

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Reality TV fan portal automation for an entertainment website: scrape and update an interactive Season vs. Winner timeline widget whenever a new Survivor season concludes.
- Data journalism analysis on reality show diversity: extract winner names and cross‐reference with public demographic data to chart changes in gender and ethnicity representation across 44 seasons.
- Trivia chatbot development for Slack communities: feed the season–winner JSON into a bot’s knowledge base so team members can query “Who won season 12?” in real time.
- Academic media‐studies research on outcome patterns: automate extraction of winners for statistical modelling of social dynamics and alliance strategies in reality television.
- E-commerce merchandising personalization: pull the latest winner list to dynamically recommend champion‐themed apparel or memorabilia tied to each Survivor season in an online store.
- Pub quiz and event planning tool for themed bars: generate question banks and answer sheets by importing season–winner pairs to create engaging Survivor trivia nights.
- DevOps monitoring and alert system: schedule a daily job to scrape the winners table, compare against existing JSON, and trigger notifications if a new ‘season’ entry appears (e.g., when Season 45 is added).

### Development Step 33: Extract Survivor (US) Winners for Seasons 1–44 and Save to JSON

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Media analytics firms ingest the Survivor winners JSON into BI dashboards to correlate winner demographics with viewership trends and advertising performance
- Fan community websites automate synchronization of Survivor winner data from Wikipedia to update leaderboards, discussion forums, and comparison charts
- E-commerce merch platforms programmatically generate winner-themed product listings (e.g., “Season 10 Winner T-Shirts”) by scraping the season-winner pairs for catalog enrichment
- Data journalism teams perform longitudinal demographic and geographic analysis of Survivor champions for feature articles on reality TV evolution
- Mobile trivia and quiz apps schedule automated updates of question banks using the extracted season-winner list to ensure up-to-date game content
- Academic researchers compiling structured datasets on reality television use the JSON output to study competition design, social dynamics, and winner profiles
- TV network production crews integrate the winners list into graphic templates for end-of-season recap montages and anniversary specials
- Chatbot and virtual assistant services query the structured winner data in real time to answer user questions like “Who won Survivor Season 27?”

### Development Step 34: Extract Survivor US Seasons 1–44 winners into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated content update for a reality TV fan site: scrape the Survivor winners list each season to refresh the “Past Champions” section without manual edits.
- Data journalism for entertainment reporting: extract season-by-season winners to analyze demographic trends and publish an interactive infographic on a news outlet.
- Machine learning feature pipeline in media analytics: incorporate historical Survivor winner names as a categorical input when training a model to predict future reality-show outcomes.
- Business intelligence dashboard for a TV network: integrate the JSON of Survivor winners with viewership and advertising revenue data to identify which champions drove audience spikes.
- Academic study on gender and diversity in reality television: gather winner names across 44 seasons, link to demographic profiles, and run statistical tests for a communications research paper.
- Podcast episode automation for Survivor recaps: pull the latest winner’s name from Wikipedia into show notes and social posts immediately after finale night.
- QA and regression testing for a mobile trivia app: validate the in-app Survivor winners database against the freshly scraped JSON to catch content drift or missing entries.
- Social media marketing campaign analysis: correlate announcement dates from the scraped winners list with Twitter hashtag volume to gauge fan engagement over time.

    "description": "Building on the initial research, I'm now focusing on the second part of the PLAN - identifying musicians/artists who participated as contestants in reality dating shows with the 4-contestant, 3-stage elimination format. I first inspected the existing research file structure, then concentrated on The Bachelor/Bachelorette series since they most clearly match the specified format (hometown visits with 4 → fantasy suites with 3 → final ceremony with 2). I've compiled a comprehensive list of known musician contestants from these shows, including Jed Wyatt (winner of Bachelorette Season 15), Luke Pell (reached final 4), James Taylor, Wes Hayden, and Chase Rice. The analysis identifies which musicians actually reached the 4-contestant elimination stage, providing the complete answer to the PLAN's requirements. Results are saved to workspace for further reference.",
