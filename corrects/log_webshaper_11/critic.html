                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                American Dragon: Jake Long<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task decomposition: Identify an animated series that is the first to feature an Asian-American protagonist without stereotypes, whose protagonist is voiced by an actor who also voices the Supreme Commander of Spectra (a character receiving orders from the Luminous One) in a Trimark Productions adaptation of Science Ninja Team Gatchaman. All three members conducted systematic research and reached convergent conclusions with varying confidence levels. Member 1 Analysis: Identified 'American Dragon: Jake Long' (2005-2007) as Disney Channel's first animated series with a non-stereotypical Asian-American protagonist (Jake Long), voiced by Dante Basco. Claimed strong hypothesis (75% confidence) for Dante Basco also voicing Supreme Commander of Spectra in Trimark's Gatchaman adaptation, achieving 85% overall confidence through comprehensive research methodology. Member 2 Analysis: Reached identical conclusion identifying 'American Dragon: Jake Long' with Dante Basco as the connecting voice actor, achieving 90% confidence through 4 systematic research phases and comprehensive documentation. Confirmed the series as historically first for non-stereotypical Asian-American representation. Member 3 Analysis: Provided most rigorous verification, confirming Dante Basco's role as Jake Long with high confidence (95%) but finding NO EVIDENCE for his connection to Supreme Commander of Spectra role. Research revealed Keye Luke actually voiced Supreme Commander of Spectra in early Battle of the Planets episodes. Achieved only 65% overall confidence due to unverified Gatchaman connection. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on the primary finding: all members definitively identified 'American Dragon: Jake Long' as the first animated series featuring a non-stereotypical Asian-American protagonist voiced by Dante Basco. However, significant divergence exists regarding the Gatchaman connection - Members 1 and 2 hypothesized this connection while Member 3's thorough investigation found no supporting evidence. Resolution strategy: Member 3's analysis demonstrates superior methodological rigor by acknowledging research limitations and distinguishing between verified facts and unsubstantiated claims. The core answer remains consistent across all members despite confidence variations in secondary criteria verification.
