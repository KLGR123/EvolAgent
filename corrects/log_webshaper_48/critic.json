  "reason": "Task decomposition: The question requires identifying when Indiana's legislative body passed a resolution to name a 23.6-mile Interstate 65 section in honor of Indiana's first governor, with the section located in a county established by Virginia's colonial legislature in 1783. All three members correctly identified Jonathan Jennings as Indiana's first governor and found that the Indiana General Assembly passed House Concurrent Resolution 57 (HCR0057) in 2016 to designate the Interstate 65 section as the 'Governor Jonathan Jennings Memorial Highway.' However, critical divergence emerged regarding the county establishment claim. Member 1 provided comprehensive research but didn't thoroughly verify the Virginia colonial legislature claim. Member 2 conducted the most rigorous verification and discovered a fundamental discrepancy: Clark County, Indiana was actually established on February 3, 1801, not 1783 by Virginia's colonial legislature as claimed in the question. Member 3 found contradictory evidence suggesting Clark County was established by Virginia in 1783. Cross-analysis reveals Members 1 and 3 accepted the premise without sufficient verification, while Member 2 applied proper fact-checking methodology. Despite the historical inaccuracy in the question's premise, all members converged on the core legislative answer: the Indiana General Assembly passed the resolution in 2016. Integration assessment: The question contains a factual error about the county's establishment, but the legislative resolution date of 2016 is consistently supported across all research approaches. Final validation confirms 2016 as the definitive answer to when the resolution was passed, regardless of the premise error.",
