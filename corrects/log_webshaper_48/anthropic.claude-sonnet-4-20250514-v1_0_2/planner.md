### Who Was the 1879 Non-Voting Congressional Delegate from Territory with First Public High School?

**TASK**: Who was elected as a non-voting delegate to the U.S. Congress in 1879 from a territory that established its first public high school in 1879, the building of which later housed the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office?

```

    "plan": "Research U.S. territories that established their first public high school in 1879 and identify which territory elected a non-voting delegate to Congress that same year. Focus on territorial histories, educational milestones, and congressional delegation records from 1879. Look for connections between early territorial high schools and later medical facilities, specifically any buildings that housed the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office.",

The research produced comprehensive documentation including territorial_research_1879_complete.json (complete research data with historical verification) and territorial_research_1879_summary.txt (executive summary report). All three criteria converge on New Mexico Territory with strong historical connections spanning from the 1879 territorial era to the modern medical facility.

### Who testified to convict two gang leaders tied to 1924–1934 robberies and a 1933 jailbreak?

**TASK**: What is the name of the person who provided testimony that helped convict two gang leaders—the leader of the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang, which committed bank robberies including their first major heist in Indiana in 1924 and a 1934 bank robbery (the last robbery participated in by John Dillinger) involving a black Hudson getaway car and prompting the city's police department to acquire a custom Studebaker car; and another leader who committed a crime during the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger, resulting in the death of a sheriff and leading to the conviction of Harry Pierpont?

ESTABLISHMENT DATE: Wikipedia clearly shows Clark County, Indiana was founded on February 3, 1801 (not 1783) - an 18-year discrepancy\n2. ESTABLISHING AUTHORITY: No mention of Virginia colonial legislature involvement found in Wikipedia\'s establishment details\n3. 1783 CONTEXT: While 1783 appears in Wikipedia, it refers to settlement beginning, not official county establishment\n\nCONFIRMED ELEMENTS:\n✅ Interstate 65 connection to Clark County, Indiana verified\n✅ Multiple mileage references found (though 23.6-mile section not specifically confirmed)\n✅ County named after General George Rogers Clark (confirmed)\n\nFINAL VERIFICATION STATUS: CLAIM CONTRADICTED\nCONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH\nEVIDENCE SOURCE: Wikipedia (generally reliable for basic historical facts)\n\nFILES CREATED IN WORKSPACE:\n• clark_county_indiana_wikipedia.html - Original Wikipedia page content\n• clark_county_indiana_verification.json - Initial research data\n• clark_county_verification_summary.txt - Summary report\n• clark_county_comprehensive_analysis.json - Detailed analysis results\n• clark_county_final_verification_report.txt - Final verification conclusions\n\nCONCLUSION: The PLAN objective has been fully accomplished.
