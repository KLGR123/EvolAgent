## Final Answer
```
THE SEAGULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Extract a sentence from a 5x7 text block by reading left to right using all letters in order. The block contains 35 letters total across 7 rows. Member 1 analysis: Used systematic approach, correctly concatenated all letters (THESEAGULLGLIDEDPEACEFULLYTOMYCHAIR) but made a critical error in word boundary identification, producing 'THESE A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR' - this creates an unnatural grammatical structure with 'THESE A GULL' instead of the proper article-noun combination. Member 2 analysis: Provided minimal methodology but reached the correct answer 'The seagull glided peacefully to my chair' - however, showed insufficient analytical rigor and lacked verification steps. Member 3 analysis: Demonstrated comprehensive systematic approach with thorough verification, correctly identified the letter sequence and applied proper word boundaries to produce 'THE SEAGULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR' - showed complete character-by-character matching and grammatical validation. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on the core letter sequence THESEAGULLGLIDEDPEACEFULLYTOMYCHAIR, but divergence in word boundary identification. Critical evaluation: Member 1's 'THESE A GULL' interpretation is grammatically awkward and less natural than 'THE SEAGULL'. Member 3's solution creates the most coherent, grammatically correct English sentence. Integration assessment: Member 3's methodology provides highest analytical rigor with proper verification, while Member 2 reached correct conclusion. Final validation confirms 'THE SEAGULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR' as the most natural and grammatically sound sentence extraction.
