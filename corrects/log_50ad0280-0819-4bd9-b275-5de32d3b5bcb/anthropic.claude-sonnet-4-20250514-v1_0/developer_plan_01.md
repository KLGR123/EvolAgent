# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 50ad0280-0819-4bd9-b275-5de32d3b5bcb  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 05:36:34

## Plan Content
```
Analyze the 5x7 block of text to extract a sentence by reading from left to right and using all letters in order. The text block is:
THESE
AGULL
GLIDE
DPEAC
EFULL
YTOMY
CHAIR

Read through each row from left to right, concatenating all letters in sequence, then identify where natural word breaks occur to form a coherent sentence using all 35 letters in the given order.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal approach because: (1) The task requires systematic extraction of a sentence from a structured text block, (2) No previous analysis exists in the history, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the hidden sentence by reading left-to-right through all letters, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to pull out the sentence using all letters in order
