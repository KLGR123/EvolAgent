  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine the unknown weight in a modified ISBN-13 validation algorithm and identify two transposed adjacent columns from 10 given numbers. The modified algorithm uses alternating weights of 1 and an unknown positive integer (less than 10) instead of standard 1 and 3 weights. Constraints specify transposed columns exclude the final column and first three columns. Individual member evaluation: All three members demonstrated identical systematic approaches with high methodological rigor. Member 1 provided comprehensive step-by-step verification showing detailed checksum calculations for all 10 numbers, with clear documentation of the alternating weight pattern (1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1) and explicit validation that each corrected number's weighted sum is divisible by 10. Member 2 conducted systematic testing across all 64 possible combinations (8 weights Ã— 8 column pairs) with proper constraint adherence. Member 3 implemented identical methodology with systematic enumeration of all valid combinations. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: all members reached identical solution (7, 9) through independent systematic testing. No contradictions identified - all approaches validated the same unique solution. Synthesis evaluation: The solution weight=7 with transposed columns at positions 9-10 (smaller index=9) represents the only combination where all 10 ISBN-like numbers pass the modified checksum validation. Integration validation confirmed through multiple verification methods: (1) systematic enumeration of all possibilities, (2) detailed checksum calculations, (3) constraint compliance verification. Final answer confidence: maximum - unique solution validated by three independent systematic analyses.",
