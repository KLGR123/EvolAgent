## Final Answer
```
Indonesia, Myanmar
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the two ASEAN countries with the greatest geographical distance between their capital cities according to Wikipedia, formatted as an alphabetically ordered comma-separated list. All three members demonstrated comprehensive understanding by: (1) correctly identifying all 10 ASEAN member countries and their capitals from Wikipedia, (2) extracting accurate geographical coordinates for each capital city, (3) applying the haversine formula to calculate great-circle distances between all possible capital city pairs. Individual evaluation: Member 1 achieved highest methodological rigor with systematic constraint mapping, complete coordinate standardization (handling mixed DMS/decimal formats), and calculated Jakarta-Naypyidaw distance as 3,250.18 km with detailed verification protocols. Member 2 used reliable definitive country lists and accurate coordinate extraction, calculating the same pair distance as 3,119.04 km with independent verification confirming methodology soundness. Member 3 employed systematic Wikipedia search approaches with robust data collection methods, calculating distance as 3,111.7 km with comprehensive 45-pair distance matrix analysis. Convergence analysis: All members unanimously identified Indonesia (Jakarta) and Myanmar (Naypyidaw) as the furthest apart capitals, demonstrating strong consensus on both methodology and conclusion. Minor distance calculation variations (3,250.18 km vs 3,119.04 km vs 3,111.7 km) stem from coordinate precision differences and rounding methodologies rather than fundamental disagreements. Cross-validation through multiple independent approaches confirms Indonesia-Myanmar as the definitive answer. Final validation: All members correctly applied alphabetical ordering (Indonesia, Myanmar) and used appropriate Wikipedia sources as specified in the task requirements.
