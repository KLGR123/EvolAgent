Joseph Bonaparte
```

## True Answer
```
Joseph Bonaparte
```

## Reasoning
```
Task decomposition: This complex historical research question requires identifying the ruler during whose reign Abel Hugo (Victor Hugo's brother) served in Madrid, spent time at Hospital de Saint Louis, and authored works with Napoleon's camp maps. All three members conducted comprehensive biographical research on Abel Hugo and reached convergent conclusions. Member evaluation: Member 1 provided systematic research identifying Abel Hugo as a French military officer who served during the Napoleonic Wars, confirming his authorship of 'Histoire de la campagne d'Espagne en 1823' and 'La France Militaire' containing Napoleon's camp documentation, and establishing the timeframe as Joseph Bonaparte's reign (1808-1813). Member 2 conducted similarly thorough research with 111 search results, confirming Abel Hugo's role as French governor of Avila during the Peninsular War and verifying the Hospital Saint Louis Madrid connection during the 1809 conversion period under French administration. Member 3 achieved comparable results with 155 search results, confirming Abel Hugo's military service and authorship of 'France Militaire' during 1808-1814. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence: all members independently identified Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain (1808-1813) during the relevant period, confirmed Abel Hugo's military service during the Napoleular Wars, verified his authorship of works documenting Napoleon's Spanish campaigns, and established the Hospital de Saint Louis conversion timeframe as 1809 under French authority. The synthesis is clear: Abel Hugo served as a French military officer during Joseph Bonaparte's reign as King of Spain, when French administration controlled Madrid and converted the Hospital de Saint Louis to military use in 1809. All members demonstrated methodological rigor with extensive archival research and source verification. Final validation confirms Joseph Bonaparte as the definitive answer with high confidence.
