This developer had developed a building located in an area along the Bournemouth Seafront, which includes the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum and the East Cliff Lift, contains historic villas from the 19th Century, and was designated as a conservation area in 1987. What is the name of this city?&quot;<br><br>```<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &quot;Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the city where a developer received planning permission in October 2019 to convert a homeless shelter into flats.

The answer is **BOURNEMOUTH**. Key evidence includes: (1) Harry Redknapp&#x27;s company Pierfront Properties received planning permission on 15 October 2019, (2) The development was to convert former hotel homeless accommodation (used since 1988) into flats and houses, (3) Location confirmed as Bournemouth, Dorset, (4) Bournemouth contains all required landmarks mentioned in the PLAN (Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th century historic villas, conservation areas designated in 1987, and seafront), (5) Multiple independent sources including BBC News article with exact date confirmation corroborate this finding. The comprehensive search results with 129 total results across 10 different query strategies overwhelmingly point to Bournemouth with 18 mentions, far exceeding any other city. The final analysis has been saved to workspace/bournemouth_planning_permission_final_analysis.json for reference. The PLAN has been 100% completed with definitive evidence.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully.
