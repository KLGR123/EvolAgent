  "reason": "(1) Task decomposition: Determine number of unique Survivor winners through Season 44 and number of American Idol winners as of the comparable timeframe, then compute the difference. Success criteria: accurate counts and correct subtraction. (2) Member evaluation: Member 1 scraped 23 “Season” entries for American Idol but erroneously assumed 23 seasons; logic coherent but factually incorrect. Member 2 correctly identified 42 unique Survivor winners (44 wins minus two repeat champions) and 21 American Idol winners (Seasons 1–21), then computed 42−21=21; methodology and data accuracy solid. Member 3 mirrored Member 1’s incorrect American Idol count of 23, leading to a flawed difference. (3) Cross-analysis: Agreement on 42 unique Survivor winners; divergence on American Idol seasons (23 vs 21). Verification against known broadcast history confirms 21 seasons completed by end 2023. (4) Synthesis: Adopt Member 2’s validated counts and subtraction. (5) Validation: Independent check of Survivor repeat winners (Sandra Diaz-Twine, Tony Vlachos) and American Idol season tally confirms result. (6) Confidence: high – final answer meets all task requirements and factual benchmarks.",
