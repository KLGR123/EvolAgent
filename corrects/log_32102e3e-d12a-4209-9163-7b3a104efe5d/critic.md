## Final Answer
```
Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the oldest Blu-Ray title from a Seattle rental store inventory spreadsheet and return it exactly as it appears in the data. Critical evaluation reveals significant discrepancy between team members. Members 1 and 2 converged on identical results: both identified 'Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe' from 2009 as the oldest Blu-Ray after analyzing 6 Blu-Ray items (rows 12-17). Both used systematic approaches to parse the Excel file, identified the Blu-Ray section marker at row 11, and extracted the same 6 titles with years 2009-2023. Member 3 produced contradictory results, claiming 'Dinosaur Accountant' from 1989 as oldest from 16 Blu-Ray items, suggesting analysis of different data sections. Cross-analysis assessment: Strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on methodology, data extraction (6 items), section identification (rows 12-17), and final result provides high confidence. Both members demonstrated rigorous Excel parsing, proper section identification, and systematic chronological analysis. Member 3's divergent result (16 vs 6 items, 1989 vs 2009 oldest year) suggests potential data misinterpretation or section misidentification. Methodological evaluation: Members 1 and 2 showed superior analytical rigor with detailed section mapping, explicit Blu-Ray section identification, and consistent data extraction processes. Integration synthesis: The 2-to-1 convergence with detailed methodological alignment strongly supports 'Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe' as the accurate answer. Final validation: Multiple independent analyses by Members 1 and 2 reaching identical conclusions through similar systematic approaches provides high confidence in result accuracy.
