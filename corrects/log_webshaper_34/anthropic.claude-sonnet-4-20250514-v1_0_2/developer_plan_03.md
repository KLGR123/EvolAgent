## Plan Content
```
Search for information about Maya Ali's lead role in a romantic action comedy film directed by Ahsan Rahim and produced by Six Sigma Entertainment. Focus on identifying the specific film that features a plot involving a gangster's arranged marriage and earned over 500 million PKR at the box office. Look for details about the film's box office performance, plot summary, and Maya Ali's role. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Search for 'Maya Ali Ahsan Rahim Six Sigma Entertainment romantic action comedy gangster marriage', (2) Look for Pakistani films that earned over 500 million PKR at box office with Maya Ali in lead role, (3) Search for Ahsan Rahim's complete filmography and directorial work with Maya Ali.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have confirmed Maya Ali won DIAFA 2022 and debuted in 'Durr-e-Shehwar' (2012), now we need to verify she starred in the specific film described to complete all criteria, (2) The previous research established two key connections, so we need the third piece about her film work with Ahsan Rahim, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the romantic action comedy film with gangster marriage plot that earned 500+ million PKR, (4) Once we confirm this film connection, we can then search for Maya Ali's birth year to provide the final answer to the TASK

### Development Step 1: Goldfinger (1964) Finale Concealment Objects and Colors Used by Bond and Pussy Galore

**Description**: Search for detailed information about the ending of the 1964 James Bond film 'Goldfinger' starring Sean Connery. Focus specifically on the final scenes where James Bond and Pussy Galore (played by Honor Blackman) take cover or conceal themselves. Look for descriptions of any objects they use for concealment, paying particular attention to the colors of these objects. Search multiple sources including movie databases (IMDb, Wikipedia), film reviews, plot summaries, and James Bond fan sites to ensure accuracy of the color details.

**Use Cases**:
- Film archive metadata tagging and color-based object recognition for streaming platforms to improve searchability of classic James Bond scenes
- Auction house prop verification and provenance research by extracting detailed descriptions (color, object type) of memorabilia from historical film endings
- Academic film studies research to analyze gendered concealment tactics and color symbolism in 1960s spy movies using automated search and keyword extraction
- Pop culture blog automation for generating in-depth scene breakdowns of iconic movie finales (e.g., Goldfinger) highlighting props and color details
- Guided tour content creation for movie location tours (e.g., Fort Knox) incorporating narrative of final scenes and specific object/color references
- Trivia app question generation focusing on memorable film details (e.g., color of the parachute James Bond hides under) by scraping multiple online sources
- Museum exhibit cataloging of cinematic artifacts, using color and object data extraction to curate displays on 1960s espionage film memorabilia
- Marketing analysis for product placement impact in classic films, identifying mentions of branded or colored props (parachutes, vehicles) in final scenes

This initial search combines all key elements: Maya Ali (actress), Ahsan Rahim (director), Six Sigma Entertainment (producer), and the genre/plot keywords (romantic action comedy, gangster, marriage). The search will help identify the specific film that matches these criteria and earned over 500 million PKR at the box office. I'm using comprehensive keyword analysis to extract relevant information about people, genres, plot elements, box office performance, and potential film titles from the search results.

This approach implements a comprehensive three-pronged search strategy: (1) A comprehensive search combining all key elements (Maya Ali, Ahsan Rahim, Six Sigma Entertainment, romantic action comedy, gangster marriage), (2) A targeted search focusing on Maya Ali's Pakistani films with high box office collections (500+ million PKR), and (3) A specific search for Ahsan Rahim's directorial filmography with Maya Ali collaborations. Each search uses multiple backend engines (Google, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, Brave, Bing, Yahoo, Mojeek) to maximize result coverage. The code includes detailed keyword analysis to identify relevant information about people, genres, plot elements, box office performance, and potential film titles. All results are saved to workspace JSON files for further analysis. This systematic approach should help identify the specific film that matches all the criteria mentioned in the PLAN.",

The code first inspects the structure of the saved JSON search files to understand their format, then systematically analyzes all search results to extract key information about the film. It organizes findings into categories: film details, cast, director, genre, plot elements, box office information, and production details. The analysis confirms most PLAN requirements: Maya Ali in lead role as 'Anya', directed by Ahsan Rahim (his directorial debut), romantic action comedy genre, and gangster marriage plot elements. However, it identifies that Six Sigma Entertainment producer credit and the specific 500+ million PKR box office figure need additional verification through focused searches.

Since we've already confirmed Maya Ali's lead role, Ahsan Rahim as director, the romantic action comedy genre, and the gangster arranged marriage plot, this search specifically targets the two remaining elements: (1) Six Sigma Entertainment as producer, and (2) 500+ million PKR box office performance. The approach uses three targeted searches: production company details, box office performance, and a comprehensive verification combining all elements. Each search uses multiple backend engines and includes detailed analysis with pattern matching for box office numbers, production company mentions, and key element verification. The code saves all results to workspace files and creates a verification summary to track progress on the remaining PLAN requirements. This systematic approach should provide the final confirmation needed to achieve 100% PLAN completion.",

The search obtained 30 total results (15 production search + 15 comprehensive search) and successfully found a crucial piece of evidence: Result #3 from the comprehensive search explicitly states that 'Teefa In Trouble' 'recently grossed PKR 500 million (Dh12.9 million) at the global box office,' directly confirming the 500+ million PKR requirement. The searches confirmed all major elements: Maya Ali as lead actress, Ahsan Rahim as director, romantic action comedy genre, and gangster marriage plot. However, the Six Sigma Entertainment producer credit remains unverified - the production searches found other companies (Lightingale Productions, Mandviwalla Entertainment, Geo Films, Yash Raj Films) but no direct Six Sigma Entertainment connection to this specific film. **PLAN** alignment: 90% complete with 5 out of 6 requirements confirmed. The code created comprehensive verification files and provided detailed analysis. Since the film matches nearly all criteria and the box office requirement is now confirmed, this represents substantial completion of the **PLAN** objectives.
