The previous analysis has fully accomplished the PLAN requirements by parsing the North American railroad museum Excel file, identifying all 7 steam locomotives in the collection through their wheel configuration patterns, and calculating the total number of wheels across all steam locomotives. The final answer is 60 total wheels for all steam locomotives in the museum collection (locomotive #1060: 4 wheels, #31: 4 wheels, #18: 8 wheels, #825: 8 wheels, #52: 10 wheels, #89: 12 wheels, #266: 14 wheels). The analysis properly distinguished steam locomotives from diesel and other locomotive types, provided detailed calculations with verification, and saved comprehensive results to workspace/steam_locomotive_wheel_analysis.json.
