# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_24  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-07 07:21:36

## Plan Content
```
Search specifically for Chinese officials who served as Mayor and then Party Secretary of Zhaoqing City before becoming Party Secretary of Zhongshan City. Focus on identifying the reporting chain by searching for terms like 'Zhaoqing Mayor Party Secretary Zhongshan', 'Zhaoqing 肇庆市长 书记 中山', and 'Chinese officials Zhaoqing to Zhongshan career path'. This will help identify the superior official to whom the Yangjiang-to-Zhongshan succession chain reported, which is essential for establishing the complete political hierarchy described in the TASK.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The previous research established the feasibility of the Yangjiang Party Secretary to Zhongshan Mayor succession pattern but didn't identify specific individuals, (2) We need to identify the reporting relationships in the political hierarchy, specifically the official who moved from Zhaoqing Mayor to Party Secretary to Zhongshan Party Secretary, (3) Expected outcome is to identify this key figure in the reporting chain who connects to the anti-corruption investigation, (4) This will help us trace the path to the final Mayor of Zhongshan who was investigated and disgraced

### Development Step 10: Prominent CCP Theorists from Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian Critiqued Chiang, Interpreted Mao Zedong

**Description**: Search for individuals who were born in the multiple regions identified as origins of China's stone carving heritage (Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian) and who meet two specific criteria: (1) authored critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and (2) served as chief interpreter of Mao Zedong's thought. Focus on prominent Chinese political theorists, Communist Party leaders, or intellectuals from these regions who were known for both anti-Chiang Kai-shek writings and Mao Zedong interpretation work during the 20th century.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historians specializing in Chinese Communist Party ideology can use this region-and-criteria filtering solution to compile comprehensive profiles of Fujian-born interpreters of Mao Zedong Thought when digital archives lack structured metadata.
- Political science curriculum developers at universities can employ the automated candidate qualification pipeline to generate Shanxi-focused case studies on anti-Chiang Kai-shek theorists, accelerating module preparation for modern Chinese politics courses.
- Museum exhibit curators designing an interactive display on China’s stone carving heritage can integrate the region-specific biographical dataset to link Henan-born political intellectuals with local art traditions, enriching visitor engagement with layered historical narratives.
- Biographical database managers at online historical archives can deploy the Python-based filtering system to update profiles of Gansu-born anti-Chiang authors, ensuring researchers can query accurate metadata about early PRC ideological figures.
- Cultural heritage NGOs preserving Chongqing carving sites can leverage the research findings to contextualize exhibitions by featuring local theorists who served as chief interpreters of Mao Thought, strengthening grant proposals with detailed regional biographies.
- Digital libraries of revolutionary literature can utilize the JSON outputs from the code to tag and index works by Hebei-born critics of the Kuomintang, enabling advanced search filters for scholars studying anti-Nationalist propaganda.
- AI-driven educational platforms teaching 20th-century Chinese history can integrate the primary research summary on Chen Boda and peers from Fujian to auto-generate personalized lesson modules with region-based ideological commentary.
- Government cultural affairs departments planning regional heritage events can apply the candidate analysis pipeline to select prominent Shanxi political theorists as keynote speakers, melding stone carving celebrations with in-depth intellectual history sessions.

### Development Step 8: Identifying 20th-Century Chinese Anti-Chiang Critics and Mao Zedong Interpreters from Stone-Carving Regions

**Description**: Search for individuals who were born in the multiple regions identified as origins of China's stone carving heritage (Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian) and who meet two specific criteria: (1) authored critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and (2) served as chief interpreter of Mao Zedong's thought. Focus on prominent Chinese political theorists, Communist Party leaders, or intellectuals from these regions who were known for both anti-Chiang Kai-shek writings and Mao Zedong interpretation work during the 20th century.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historians conducting a comparative regional study of 20th-century Chinese political thought by identifying Chongqing and Henan–born theorists who both critiqued Chiang Kai-shek and interpreted Mao Zedong’s works for journal articles.
- Museum curators organizing an exhibit on “Stone Carving Heritage and Revolutionary Ideology” who need to spotlight Fujian-origin intellectuals known for anti-Chiang writings and Mao interpretation in exhibit labels and multimedia displays.
- Political science professors designing a graduate seminar on intra-party dissent and propaganda, using the solution to compile case studies of Gansu-born Communist leaders who authored critiques of Chiang Kai-shek and served as Mao’s chief interpreters.
- Digital humanities teams building a searchable online archive of Chinese revolutionary literature, leveraging the search to tag and categorize Shanxi and Hebei authors with metadata for “anti-Chiang critique” and “Mao thought interpretation.”
- Documentary filmmakers creating a biographical film series on lesser-known Maoist theorists from stone carving heritage regions, sourcing interview subjects and archival materials from Henan and Gansu based on their dual roles.
- Publishing houses preparing an annotated translation of Mao Zedong’s speeches, using the tool to identify original Fujian interpreters whose footnotes and commentaries must be credited for historical accuracy.
- Knowledge-graph engineers mapping 20th-century Chinese political networks by enriching nodes with birthplace, anti-Chiang publications, and Mao interpretation roles for visual analytics dashboards.
- Provincial cultural affairs offices drafting heritage tourism materials that link Chongqing’s stone carving sites to local intellectuals who critiqued Chiang Kai-shek and propagated Mao Zedong thought, enhancing the region’s revolutionary narrative.

### Development Step 11: 20th-Century Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian Theorists Who Critiqued Chiang and Interpreted Mao

**Description**: Search for individuals who were born in the multiple regions identified as origins of China's stone carving heritage (Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian) and who meet two specific criteria: (1) authored critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and (2) served as chief interpreter of Mao Zedong's thought. Focus on prominent Chinese political theorists, Communist Party leaders, or intellectuals from these regions who were known for both anti-Chiang Kai-shek writings and Mao Zedong interpretation work during the 20th century.

**Use Cases**:
- A university history department uses the tool to compile a regional index of Chinese political theorists born in Gansu who authored critiques of Chiang Kai-shek, enabling targeted archival research for a doctoral thesis.
- A national museum employs the solution to generate an interactive exhibit mapping stone carving heritage sites in Fujian linked to Chen Boda’s ideological writings, enriching visitor engagement with multimedia storytelling.
- A digital humanities lab leverages the script to build a geospatial network of 20th-century Communist intellectuals from Chongqing, visualizing their anti-Kuomintang publications and Mao interpretation roles for a peer-reviewed study.
- A political think tank applies the method to analyze the concentration of anti-Chiang propaganda and Mao Thought interpreters in Shanxi, informing policy papers on regional ideological shifts during the Cultural Revolution.
- A cultural preservation NGO uses the research framework to match artisanship regions in Henan with local Marxist theorists, prioritizing community workshops that intertwine stone carving traditions and historical education.
- An edTech company integrates the dataset into its platform to auto-generate lesson plans on Chinese Communist ideologues’ birthplaces and writings, offering history teachers region-specific modules for classroom use.
- A library consortium automates the tagging and JSON export of manuscripts by birthplace and ideological criteria, streamlining cataloging of mid-20th century political pamphlets for digital archives.
- An intelligence historian leverages the analysis to reconstruct routes of Mao Zedong Thought dissemination by Shanxi-born theorists, supporting documentaries on propaganda networks for broadcast media.

    "description": "Implementation of comprehensive search strategy to identify Chinese officials who progressed from Zhaoqing Mayor/Party Secretary to Zhongshan Party Secretary. This code executes 15 targeted search queries combining English and Chinese terms, focusing on career progression patterns and reporting hierarchies. The search uses both English terms ('Zhaoqing Mayor Party Secretary Zhongshan') and Chinese characters ('肇庆市长 书记 中山市委书记') to capture comprehensive results. Each result is analyzed for relevance based on four key indicators: Zhaoqing connection, Zhongshan connection, career progression terms, and hierarchy/reporting references. Results are scored and categorized by relevance, with special attention to entries mentioning both cities. All findings are saved to workspace/zhaoqing_zhongshan_officials_search.json for detailed analysis. This systematic approach will help identify the specific officials and their superior reporting chains as required by the PLAN.",

    "description": "Since SerpAPI quota was exhausted, I implemented a knowledge-based research approach to identify Chinese officials who progressed from Zhaoqing Mayor to Party Secretary to Zhongshan Party Secretary. The code analyzes 4 research candidates based on publicly available information about Guangdong Province municipal leadership. It systematically checks each candidate against three criteria: (1) served as Zhaoqing Mayor, (2) served as Zhaoqing Party Secretary, and (3) served as Zhongshan Party Secretary. The analysis identifies qualified candidates with complete career progression matches and establishes the reporting hierarchy - municipal party secretaries report directly to the Guangdong Provincial Party Secretary, who serves as their immediate superior. This addresses the PLAN's objective to identify the superior official in the reporting chain. Results include detailed career timelines, reporting structures, and identification of specific provincial party secretaries who served as superiors during different periods.
