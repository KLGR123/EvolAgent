# Developer Plan #3 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 2a649bb1-795f-4a01-b3be-9a01868dae73  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 3  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-06 19:12:33

## Plan Content
```
Download and analyze the full text of the 2016 paper 'Effects of Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus and Sweet Potato Chlorotic Stunt Virus on the Yield of Sweet Potato in Uganda' from the identified academic sources (CIP and Wiley Online Library). Extract the complete methodology section that details the virus testing protocols, focusing on identifying the specific chemicals used for virus detection along with their exact EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers. Cross-reference multiple sections including materials and methods, laboratory procedures, and reagent specifications to ensure comprehensive extraction of all chemical reagents and their corresponding EC numbers.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the critical next step because: (1) The previous analysis identified the target paper and common chemicals (ENZYME and ANTIBODY) but could not extract specific EC numbers from search snippets alone, (2) We need access to the full methodology sections to find the exact EC numbers required by the TASK, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the complete virus testing protocol with specific chemical reagents and their EC numbers, (4) This will enable us to identify the two most commonly used chemicals with their EC numbers and format them as semicolon-separated values in alphabetical order as requested

### Development Step 1: Find Nedoshivina 2010 Publication Describing Kuznetzov’s Vietnamese Specimens, Including Methods and Repository Info

**Description**: Search for Nedoshivina's 2010 scientific paper that includes descriptions of Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov. Focus on finding the complete publication with methods/materials sections or specimen repository information. Use these search approaches: (1) Academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or ResearchGate using keywords 'Nedoshivina 2010 Vietnamese specimens Kuznetzov', (2) Taxonomic databases that might reference specimen deposits, (3) Journal archives that published the paper in 2010. Look specifically for sections mentioning specimen deposition, museum collections, or institutional repositories where the Vietnamese materials were stored.

**Use Cases**:
- Entomology researcher retrieving Nedoshivina’s 2010 paper to verify Vietnamese veneer moth specimen depositories before describing a new related species
- Museum curator cross-referencing taxonomic literature to confirm the institutional repository and accession numbers of Kuznetzov’s Vietnam collection for database curation
- Graduate student compiling methods and material details from primary sources to support a molecular phylogeny of Southeast Asian Tortricidae
- Biodiversity informatics specialist automating DOI and PDF link extraction for taxonomic publications to integrate specimen metadata into an online species portal
- Conservation biologist mapping historical specimen localities in Vietnam by extracting georeferenced collection data from Nedoshivina’s publication
- Journal editor validating author-provided repository statements against original publications to ensure compliance with taxonomic code requirements
- Natural history collection manager updating digital catalogs by linking specimen records to their original taxonomic descriptions and museum holdings
- Academic librarian indexing obscure entomological articles in digital archives, using SerpAPI to locate full-text PDFs and DOIs for 2010 publications

### Development Step 2: Locate Nedoshivina 2010 paper on Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov, including methods and repository info

**Description**: Search for Nedoshivina's 2010 scientific paper that includes descriptions of Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov. Focus on finding the complete publication with methods/materials sections or specimen repository information. Use these search approaches: (1) Academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or ResearchGate using keywords 'Nedoshivina 2010 Vietnamese specimens Kuznetzov', (2) Taxonomic databases that might reference specimen deposits, (3) Journal archives that published the paper in 2010. Look specifically for sections mentioning specimen deposition, museum collections, or institutional repositories where the Vietnamese materials were stored.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum curators automatically extracting specimen deposition details from Nedoshivina’s 2010 catalogue to update and verify their Tortricidae collection database at ZISP
- Biodiversity informaticians harvesting Vietnamese Tortricidae origin and repository metadata from published PDFs to integrate into a global species occurrence platform
- Academic researchers conducting a meta‐analysis of Tortricidae diversity by programmatically discovering, downloading, and parsing type specimen catalogues from online archives
- Digital librarians automating the discovery and archiving of obscure entomological publications in Atalanta to ensure complete institutional repository holdings
- Grant administrators monitoring open‐access compliance by locating and validating full‐text taxonomic papers in Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and journal archives
- Conservation biologists retrieving museum accession numbers and collection localities from PDF methods sections to model habitat suitability for endangered moth species
- Systematics PhD students streamlining their literature reviews by scraping abstracts, methods/materials, and repository information from historical taxonomic papers
- Data journalists investigating transparency in specimen reporting by aggregating repository details from multiple scientific databases into an interactive dashboard

### Development Step 3: Confirm 2011 Extractive Metallurgy of Ni, Co, PGM Includes Lithium Calcination and Two-Stage Bioleaching

**Description**: Verify the identified 2011 Elsevier publication 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by conducting a targeted search to confirm it specifically covers both the calcination process with lithium salts for recovering metals from spent automotive catalysts AND the two-stage bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for low-grade cobalt ores. Search for the book's table of contents, chapter summaries, or detailed reviews that explicitly mention these two specific processes. Cross-reference with academic databases, publisher catalogs, and technical literature citations to ensure this publication contains both required methodologies described in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Patent due diligence for materials science: verifying that a 2022 WO patent application covers both reinforced polymer composites and flame-retardant additive processing steps by targeted SerpAPI queries to patent office and scholarly sources
- Pharmaceutical guideline confirmation: ensuring the 2020 WHO monograph explicitly includes renal dosage adjustment protocols and adverse reaction monitoring procedures by searching chapter summaries and section titles
- Automotive supplier audit: confirming an ISO/TS 16949 supplier manual online covers both heat-treatment procedures for chassis parts and corrosion-resistance testing protocols using focused Google searches
- Open-source software compliance check: verifying that a cryptography library’s documentation details both RSA key generation methods and AES-GCM encryption usage via structured search queries on GitHub Pages and developer blogs
- Market intelligence white-paper analysis: ensuring a competitor’s 2021 market study contains consumer behavior segmentation for North America and side-by-side feature comparisons with key rivals by scanning executive summaries and table of contents
- Academic textbook syllabus alignment: confirming a 2023 engineering thermodynamics textbook includes both entropy analysis chapters and exergy efficiency case studies as mandated by a university course outline
- GDPR compliance verification: checking that the EU’s official GDPR guidelines PDF addresses both data subject access rights and data breach notification requirements by targeted searches of section headings and legal commentary
- Environmental impact report validation: verifying that a 2019 EPA assessment document covers both greenhouse gas emission quantification methods and carbon capture technology evaluations through focused online catalog and summary searches

    "description": "Following the tester's recommendation to examine existing workspace files before trying new download strategies. I'm systematically inspecting the 4 existing files to understand their structure and content. First, I check basic file properties (size, type), then examine the structure of JSON files by looking at top-level keys and data types without diving too deep initially. For text files, I show the first few lines and search for relevant terms like 'feathery mottle virus', 'methodology', 'EC number', etc. I'm particularly focusing on the 'spfmv_spcsv_detailed_analysis_summary.txt' file since it appears to be the most processed content. I'm looking for methodology sections, virus testing protocols, and any mentions of EC numbers or the target 2016 Uganda paper. This systematic inspection will determine whether the existing files already contain the needed information or if I need to pursue alternative download strategies using SerpAPI.",

The file structure analysis revealed that 'spfmv_spcsv_detailed_analysis_summary.txt' contains the target terms (feathery mottle virus, chlorotic stunt virus, uganda, 2016, methodology, methods, ec number, virus detection) and the JSON files show structured analysis results with 217 total results analyzed. However, the code crashed with a NameError on line 143 due to 'section_lower' being undefined in a generator expression - this appears to be a variable scoping issue in the methodology section detection logic. **PLAN** alignment: 60% - workspace inspection successful and target content located, but detailed extraction halted by the bug. The inspection results were saved to 'workspace/file_inspection_results.json'.

Now conducting comprehensive analysis of existing workspace files to extract methodology and EC number information. I'm systematically examining the summary text file for target paper sections, methodology content, and EC number mentions. Then analyzing the JSON analysis results file to understand the processed data structure including virus testing methods, chemical reagents, and any EC numbers already found. Finally examining the large search results JSON files to locate PDF links and direct paper access points. This approach follows the tester's guidance to fully utilize existing processed data before attempting new downloads. The analysis will determine if the existing files contain sufficient methodology information or if additional downloads are needed.",

The variable 'section_lower' is being referenced in a generator expression before it's properly defined within the loop scope. While the code successfully analyzed workspace files and found promising content (existing analysis of 217 results, virus testing methods catalogued, chemical reagents identified), the execution halted before completing the detailed methodology extraction. **PLAN** alignment: 40% - workspace files contain relevant processed data but extraction incomplete due to the persistent scoping bug. The code shows good analysis structure and found target paper references, but the critical methodology and EC number extraction cannot proceed until the variable scoping issue is resolved. Next step: Fix the NameError by moving the 'section_lower = section.lower()' assignment inside the loop before the generator expression, then complete the detailed analysis of the existing processed files to extract the required methodology sections, virus testing protocols, and EC numbers that appear to already be catalogued in the workspace data.",

    "description": "Fixed the persistent variable scope error by completely restructuring the analysis approach. Instead of using problematic generator expressions, I'm now systematically examining each workspace file with proper variable handling. I'm displaying the complete content of the summary file since it's reasonably sized (2,838 characters), then conducting detailed analysis of the JSON results file by inspecting its structure before accessing data. For the large search results files, I'm systematically extracting PDF links and target paper matches without scope issues. This approach ensures I can identify all available PDF download candidates and target paper matches from the existing processed data. The goal is to compile a comprehensive list of download sources and then proceed with PDF retrieval and methodology extraction to find the specific virus testing protocols, chemical reagents, and EC numbers required by the PLAN.",

ENZYME (mentioned 3 times)\n2. ANTIBODY (mentioned 2 times)\n\nEC NUMBERS:\n- No specific EC numbers were identified in the search result snippets\n- This detailed information would require access to the full methodology sections of the papers\n- The target 2016 paper "Effects of Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus and Sweet Potato Chlorotic Stunt Virus on the Yield of Sweet Potato in Uganda" appears to be available through multiple access points\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Access the full 2016 paper through identified CIP or Wiley links\n2. Focus on methodology sections for specific EC numbers\n3. RT-RPA and ELISA appear to be the dominant detection methods\n4. Enzyme-based detection systems are prevalent in the literature\n\nFILE LOCATIONS:\n- Detailed JSON analysis: workspace_2a649bb1-795f-4a01-b3be-9a01868dae73/spfmv_spcsv_analysis_results.json\n- Summary report: workspace_2a649bb1-795f-4a01-b3be-9a01868dae73/spfmv_spcsv_detailed_analysis_summary.txt\n\n=== END OF ANALYSIS SUMMARY ===\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n🔍 KEYWORD ANALYSIS:\ntarget_paper: ✅ Found\nmethodology: [\'method\', \'protocol\', \'detection\', \'analysis\']\nec_numbers: [\'ec \', \'ec number\']\nchemicals: [\'reagent\', \'chemical\', \'enzyme\', \'antibody\']\nyear_2016: ✅ Found\nuganda: ✅ Found\n\n================================================================================\nANALYZING PROCESSED RESULTS JSON FILE\n================================================================================\n\n📊 LOADING: spfmv_spcsv_analysis_results.json\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFile size: 11,865 characters\n\n📋 JSON STRUCTURE:\nTop-level keys: [\'analysis_timestamp\', \'total_results_analyzed\', \'virus_testing_methods\', \'chemical_reagents\', \'ec_numbers_found\', \'relevant_uganda_papers\', \'target_paper_matches\', \'laboratory_protocols_found\', \'chemical_specific_results_count\', \'detailed_findings\']\n\n🔹 ANALYSIS_TIMESTAMP:\n   20250806_analysis\n\n🔹 TOTAL_RESULTS_ANALYZED:\n   217\n\n🔹 VIRUS_TESTING_METHODS:\n   Dictionary with 3 keys: [\'total_mentions\', \'unique_methods\', \'top_methods\']\n     total_mentions: 38\n     unique_methods: 8\n     top_methods: <class \'dict\'> with 8 items\n\n🔹 CHEMICAL_REAGENTS:\n   Dictionary with 3 keys: [\'total_mentions\', \'unique_chemicals\', \'top_chemicals\']\n     total_mentions: 5\n     unique_chemicals: 2\n     top_chemicals: <class \'dict\'> with 2 items\n\n🔹 EC_NUMBERS_FOUND:\n   List with 0 items\n\n🔹 RELEVANT_UGANDA_PAPERS:\n   20\n\n🔹 TARGET_PAPER_MATCHES:\n   0\n\n🔹 LABORATORY_PROTOCOLS_FOUND:\n   40\n\n🔹 CHEMICAL_SPECIFIC_RESULTS_COUNT:\n   2\n\n🔹 DETAILED_FINDINGS:\n   Dictionary with 4 keys: [\'target_papers\', \'top_relevant_papers\', \'laboratory_protocols\', \'chemical_specific_results\']\n     target_papers: List with 0 items\n     top_relevant_papers: List with 10 items\n       - {\'title\': \'Development of a dual RT-RPA detection for Sweet potato ...\', \'link\': \'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890850822000573\', \'snippet\': \'Adikini et al.

    "description": "Attempting to download the target 2016 Uganda sweet potato virus paper from the most promising sources identified in the workspace analysis. I'm prioritizing ResearchGate and Wiley Online Library links since they showed the highest probability of containing the exact target paper. Using comprehensive browser headers to avoid blocking and implementing proper error handling for different response types. For each download attempt, I'm checking content type and file size to distinguish between PDFs and HTML pages. If I get HTML pages (like ResearchGate publication pages), I'm saving them and scanning for embedded PDF download links using regex patterns. All successful downloads are saved with descriptive filenames in the workspace directory. The goal is to obtain the actual PDF content so I can parse the methodology sections and extract the specific virus testing protocols, chemical reagents, and EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers as required by the PLAN. If direct PDF download fails, the HTML pages may contain alternative access methods or embedded content that can be analyzed.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully downloaded 2 PDF files totaling 2.5MB from academic sources. The script attempted 4 priority sources and achieved 50% success rate: Core.ac.uk provided the target paper PDF (790KB) and Uganda Agricultural Guidelines PDF (1.66MB). ResearchGate and Wiley downloads failed with HTTP 403 (access forbidden), but the Core.ac.uk source delivered what appears to be the actual 2016 Uganda sweet potato virus paper based on file size and validation. The code properly verified PDF format, saved files with descriptive names, and generated comprehensive download summary with next steps clearly identified. **PLAN** alignment: 70% - PDFs successfully obtained for methodology extraction, but still needs parsing of downloaded content to extract virus testing protocols, chemical reagents, and specific EC numbers. The workspace now contains the target paper content ready for detailed methodology analysis. Next step: Parse the downloaded PDF files (especially 'target_paper_uganda_2016_source_3.pdf' from Core.ac.uk) to extract the complete methodology section, identify virus testing protocols, and locate specific chemicals with their EC numbers as required by the PLAN.",

    "description": "Parsing the downloaded PDF files to extract the complete methodology section with virus testing protocols, chemical reagents, and EC numbers as required by the PLAN. I'm using LangChain's PyPDFLoader to properly parse the PDF content, then systematically analyzing it to: (1) Confirm this is the target 2016 Uganda paper by checking for key terms like SPFMV, SPCSV, Uganda, methodology, (2) Extract the methodology/materials and methods section by searching for section headers, (3) Use regex patterns to find EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers in various formats, (4) Identify chemical reagents and enzymes mentioned in virus detection protocols, (5) Extract virus testing protocol sections that detail the laboratory procedures. The approach prioritizes the smaller PDF (likely the research paper) over the larger technical guidelines. All extracted data is saved to a structured JSON file for comprehensive analysis. This systematic parsing will provide the detailed methodology information needed to complete the PLAN requirements.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed due to code error - Code successfully loaded the target paper PDF from Core.ac.uk (790,779 bytes, 20 pages) and confirmed it contains the correct 2016 Uganda paper with key terms found (sweet potato feathery mottle virus, spfmv, spcsv, uganda, materials and methods, elisa). However, the code crashed with a NameError: 'section_lower' is not defined during the methodology section extraction phase. The PDF parsing was successful and the content analysis showed 53,605 characters of text content, but the critical methodology and EC number extraction could not complete due to the variable scoping bug in the section analysis loop. **PLAN** alignment: 60% - target paper successfully identified and loaded, but methodology extraction incomplete due to the persistent coding error. The code shows the target paper is confirmed and ready for analysis, but needs the variable scoping issue fixed to complete the extraction of virus testing protocols, chemical reagents, and EC numbers. Next step: Fix the NameError by properly defining the 'section_lower' variable within the loop scope before using it in conditional statements, then complete the methodology section extraction and EC number identification from the confirmed target paper content.",

    "description": "Fixed the persistent variable scope error by properly defining 'current_section_lower' within each loop iteration before using it in conditional statements. Now systematically extracting the complete methodology section from the confirmed 2016 Uganda sweet potato virus paper. The approach includes: (1) Proper PDF parsing and content verification, (2) Methodology section extraction with multiple search patterns, (3) Comprehensive EC number search using regex patterns for various formats, (4) Chemical reagent identification organized by categories (antibodies, enzymes, substrates, buffers, etc.), (5) Virus testing protocol extraction focusing on ELISA, RT-PCR, and detection methods, (6) Context extraction around each found chemical/EC number for better understanding. All results are saved to a comprehensive JSON file with task completion status tracking. This addresses the PLAN requirements for extracting virus testing protocols, specific chemicals, and their EC numbers from the target paper's methodology sections.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed due to persistent variable scope error - Code successfully downloaded the target 2016 Uganda paper PDF (790KB from Core.ac.uk) and confirmed it contains all required key terms (SPFMV, SPCSV, Uganda, methodology, ELISA) with 53,605 characters across 20 pages. However, the same NameError: 'section_lower' is not defined crashed the extraction process during methodology section analysis. This is the third iteration with the identical variable scoping bug preventing completion of the core PLAN requirement. **PLAN** alignment: 65% - target paper successfully obtained and verified, but methodology extraction blocked by recurring coding error.

Field plots planted with graft inoculated plants of virus-free\ncultivars Beauregard, Dimbuka, Ejumula, Kabode and NASPOT 1 were\nused to assess the effect of SPFMV and SPCSV on yield and quality of\nsweetpotatoes in two agro-ecologies. SPFMV spreads rapidly to control\nplots at Makerere University Agricultural Research Institute Kabanyolo\n(MUARIK), and these plots had similar yields to those singly infected\nwith SPFMV but at the National Semi Arid Resource Research Institute\n(NaSARRI) where SPFMV spreads slowly, plots infected with SPFMV\nyielded 40% less than the control. Recovery from SPFMV appeared to\nbe more frequent at NaSARRI than at MUARIK. Infection by SPCSV\nalone resulted in yield losses of 14 –52%, while mixed infections of\nSPFMV+SPCSV resulted in yield losses in both locations of 60 –95%\ndepending on the cultivar. SPCSV and mixed infections of\nSPFMV+SPCSV also reduced the number of roots formed as well as the\ndiameter of the roots, resulting in a greater length to diameter ratio\ncompared to the healthy control. This study, therefore, conﬁrms that\nboth SPFMV and SPCSV, both singly and when mixed, can reduce yield,\nthe extent depending on the cultivar. To mitigate the effect of these\nviruses, farmers should use clean planting materials of resistant varieties.\nIntroduction\nSweetpotato is a vegetatively propagated crop, and\nsystemic pathogens like viruses can persist and spread\nover successive crop cycles (Bryan et al. 2003). Over\n30 viruses belonging to potyvirus, crinivirus, carla-\nvirus, cucumovirus, ipomovirus, badnavirus and\nbegomovirus have been reported to infect sweetpota-\ntoes worldwide (Mukasa et al. 2006; Untiveros et al.\n2007; Valverde et al. 2007; Clark et al. 2012). Of\nthese, only six have been reported in Uganda, namely\nSweet potato feathery mottle virus(SPFMV), Sweet potato\nchlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV), Sweet potato chlorotic ﬂecks\nvirus (SPCFV), Sweet potato collusive virus(SPCV), Sweet\npotato mild mottle virus (SPMMV) and Sweet potato leaf\ncurl Uganda virus (SPLCUV) (Gibson et al. 19\n\n...

All findings are saved to a structured JSON file with task completion status. This addresses all PLAN requirements: downloading the paper, extracting methodology, identifying virus testing protocols, finding specific chemicals, and searching for EC numbers (though none found in standard format, key enzymes are identified with likely EC associations).",

This\nstudy therefore aimed to determine the effects of single\ninfection of SPFMV or SPCSV and their combination\non the yield of four sweetpotato cultivars grown in\nUganda under ﬁeld conditions of two agro-ecologies.\nMaterials and Methods\nVirus testing\nThree leaf samples (leaf disc of~1 cm diameter) per\n\nplant were picked from the top, middle and bottom\npart of the plants and ground in a polyvinyl bag\nusing appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay (ELISA) extraction buffer (1 ml buffer per leaf\ndisc). The leaf samples were tested either using NCM\nELISA or DAS and TAS ELISA. Nitrocellulose mem-\nbrane ELISA was carried out following the protocol\nobtained from CIP Lima, Peru to detect the presence\nof any of the ten viruses, that is SPFMV, SPMMV,\nSweet potato latent virus (SPLV), SPCFV, Sweet potato\n\nmild speckling virus(SPMSV), C-6 virus, SPCSV, SPCV,\nSweet potato virus G (SPVG) and Cucumber mosaic virus\n(CMV) for which antibodies were available. The\npresence of virus was judged on the visual intensity\nof the colour change on the membrane. Additional\ntests using DAS and TAS ELISA were speciﬁcally car-\nried out to detect and estimate the virus titre for\nSPFMV or SPCSV, respectively, using protocol by\nClark and Adams (1977). The DAS-ELISA kit (con-\ntaining coating antibody immunoglobulin G (IgG)\n\nand detecting antibody IgG-AP) against SPFMV and\nTAS ELISA kit containing (primary antibody, rabbit\nIgG, secondary mouse monoclonal antibody MAb\nand detection antibody, rabbit anti-mouse IgG-AP)\nagainst SPCSV and respective positive controls were\nfrom Leibniz-Institut DSMZ-Deutsche sammlung von\nMikroorganismen und Zellkuturen GmbH, Germany.\nThe p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate and micro-\nplates used were from Sigma Chemical Co. The\nabsorbance was measured at 405 nm after one and\n\nhalf hours using a Bio-Rad microplate reader (model\n680).\nThe p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate and micro-\nplates used were from Sigma Chemical Co.

I've rewritten the code to avoid all problematic variable references by using explicit variable definitions and proper scoping throughout. The approach systematically: (1) Loads and verifies the target 2016 Uganda paper PDF, (2) Extracts the methodology section using regex pattern matching for section headers, (3) Searches comprehensively for EC numbers using multiple pattern variations, (4) Identifies chemical reagents by category with unique chemical tracking, (5) Extracts virus testing protocol sections with context expansion, (6) Compiles comprehensive results showing DAS-ELISA, TAS-ELISA, and NCM-ELISA methods with specific chemicals like antibodies (IgG, monoclonal), enzymes (alkaline phosphatase), substrates (p-nitrophenyl phosphate), and buffers (extraction buffer). All findings are saved to a detailed JSON file with complete task completion status. This addresses all PLAN requirements: downloading the paper from academic sources, extracting the complete methodology section, identifying specific virus testing protocols, finding chemical reagents used for detection, and searching for EC numbers (with enzyme associations where standard format not found).",

The script loaded the target PDF (790,779 bytes, 20 pages) and confirmed it contains all required key terms (SPFMV, SPCSV, Uganda, materials and methods, ELISA). The methodology section was successfully extracted (10,231 characters) showing detailed virus testing protocols including DAS-ELISA for SPFMV detection and TAS-ELISA for SPCSV detection. Chemical reagents were systematically identified across 6 categories: Antibodies (18 mentions including coating antibody, immunoglobulin G, IgG-AP), Enzymes (5 mentions including enzyme-linked components), Substrates (6 mentions including p-nitrophenyl phosphate), Buffers (3 mentions including ELISA extraction buffer), Detection Systems (44 mentions including DAS-ELISA, TAS-ELISA, NCM-ELISA), and Equipment (6 mentions including Bio-Rad microplate reader, Sigma Chemical). While no standard EC numbers were found, key enzymes were identified with likely EC associations (alkaline phosphatase likely EC 3.1.3.1). The comprehensive results were saved to 'workspace/comprehensive_methodology_extraction.json' with complete task completion summary. **PLAN** alignment: 100% - all requirements fulfilled including downloading the full text, extracting complete methodology section, identifying virus testing protocols with detailed procedures, finding specific chemicals used for virus detection, and conducting comprehensive EC number search.

The leaf samples were tested either using NCM ELISA or DAS and TAS ELISA. Nitrocellulose mem- brane ELISA was carried out following the protocol obtained from CIP Lima, Peru to detect the presence of any of the ten viruses, that is SPFMV, SPMMV, Sweet potato latent virus (SPLV), SPCFV, Sweet potato mild speckling virus(SPMSV), C-6 virus, SPCS\n\nProtocol Section 2:\n----------------------------------------\ne the effects of single infection of SPFMV or SPCSV and their combination on the yield of four sweetpotato cultivars grown in Uganda under ﬁeld conditions of two agro-ecologies. Materials and Methods Virus testing Three leaf samples (leaf disc of~1 cm diameter) per plant were picked from the top, middle and bottom part of the plants and ground in a polyvinyl bag using appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) extraction buffer (1 ml buffer per leaf disc).

The presence of virus was judged on the visual intensity of the colour change on the membrane. Additional tests using DAS and TAS ELISA were speciﬁcally car- ried out to detect and estimate the virus titre for SPFMV or SPCSV, respectively, using protocol by Clark and Adams (1977). The DAS-ELISA kit (con- taining coating antibody immunoglobulin G (IgG) and detecting antibody IgG-AP) against SPFMV and TAS ELISA kit containing (primary antibody, rabbit IgG, secondary mouse monoclonal antibody MAb and detection antibody, rabbit anti-mouse IgG-AP) against SPCSV and respective positive con\n\nProtocol Section 4:\n----------------------------------------\nand SPCSV were sourced from farmers’ ﬁelds at Namulonge, Wakiso district. Cut- tings were collected and graft inoculated onto the nearly universal indicator plant, Ipomoea setosa, and left to grow to allow symptoms to express. The symptomatic plants were tested using nitro-cellulose membrane (NCM) ELISA for ten viruses for which the antibodies were available and those reacting positively for SPFMV and for SPCSV alone were selected and retested using DAS or TAS ELISA, respectively. SPCSV was maintained in cv Kampala white, SPFMV was maintained in cv Resisto, and mixed SPFMV + SPCSV was maintai\n\n💾 COMPREHENSIVE RESULTS SAVED TO: workspace_2a649bb1-795f-4a01-b3be-9a01868dae73/comprehensive_methodology_extraction.json\n\n================================================================================\nPLAN COMPLETION SUMMARY\n================================================================================\n\n🎯 TASK SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED:\n✅ Downloaded and analyzed 2016 Uganda sweet potato virus paper\n✅ Extracted methodology section (10,231 characters)\n✅ Identified virus testing protocols (18 sections)\n✅ Found chemical reagents (6 categories)\n✅ Searched comprehensively for EC numbers\n\n📊 KEY METHODOLOGY FINDINGS:\n\n🔬 Virus Testing Methods:\n   • DAS-ELISA (Double Antibody Sandwich ELISA) for SPFMV\n   • TAS-ELISA (Triple Antibody Sandwich ELISA) for SPCSV\n   • NCM-ELISA (Nitrocellulose Membrane ELISA) for 10 viruses\n   • Graft inoculation for virus indexing\n\n🧪 Key Chemical Reagents Identified:\n   • Antibodies: 9 unique chemicals\n     - antibody\n     - antibodies\n     - immunoglobulin\n   • Enzymes: 3 unique chemicals\n     - enzyme\n     - Rnase\n     - IgG-AP\n   • Substrates: 3 unique chemicals\n     - substrate\n     - p-nitrophenyl phosphate\n     - phosphate substrate\n   • Buffers: 2 unique chemicals\n     - buffer\n     - extraction buffer\n   • Detection Systems: 5 unique chemicals\n     - ELISA\n     - DAS-ELISA\n     - TAS ELISA\n   • Equipment: 3 unique chemicals\n     - microplate reader\n     - Bio-Rad\n     - Sigma Chemical\n\n🔢 EC Numbers Status:\n   • No standard EC format found, but key enzymes identified:\n     - Alkaline phosphatase (likely EC 3.1.3.1)\n     - Associated with IgG-AP conjugates in ELISA\n\n📋 PLAN REQUIREMENTS FULFILLED:\n✅ Downloaded full text from academic sources (Core.ac.uk)\n✅ Analyzed complete methodology section\n✅ Extracted virus testing protocols with detailed procedures\n✅ Identified specific chemicals used for virus detection\n✅ Cross-referenced multiple sections for comprehensive extraction\n✅ Searched systematically for EC numbers\n\n🎉 METHODOLOGY EXTRACTION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!\n\n================================================================================\nFINAL EXTRACTION COMPLETED\n================================================================================",
