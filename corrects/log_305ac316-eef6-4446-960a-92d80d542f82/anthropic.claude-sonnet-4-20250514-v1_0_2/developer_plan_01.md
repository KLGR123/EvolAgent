## Plan Content
```
Search for information about the Polish-language version of 'Everybody Loves Raymond' to identify the actor who played the character Ray. Focus on finding cast information, dubbing details, or Polish adaptation records through multiple search approaches: (1) Search for 'Everybody Loves Raymond Polish version cast Ray actor', (2) Look for Polish television adaptation or dubbing information, (3) Search Polish entertainment databases or Wikipedia pages about the show's international versions, (4) Check for any Polish remake or localized version details. Extract the complete name of the actor who voiced or played Ray in the Polish version for further analysis.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific actor who played Ray in the Polish version of the show, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the Polish cast information and identify the Ray actor, (4) This directly targets the first part of the task requirement before we can research their role in 'Magda M.'

    "description": "Initial comprehensive search for Polish version of 'Everybody Loves Raymond' cast information. I implemented the PLAN by executing 4 different search strategies: (1) Direct search for Polish cast and Ray actor, (2) Search for Polish television dubbing information, (3) Wikipedia and entertainment database search using site-specific queries, (4) Search for Polish remake or adaptation details. Each search uses different keyword combinations and approaches to maximize the chances of finding the specific actor who played Ray in the Polish version. All search results are being saved to workspace JSON files with UTF-8 encoding to preserve any Polish characters. The searches focus on identifying voice actors, dubbing cast, remake cast, or adaptation information. This systematic approach covers multiple potential sources where this information might be found, from direct cast listings to entertainment databases to Wikipedia international version pages.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed comprehensive search operations using 4 different search approaches as specified in the **PLAN**. The script successfully executed all API calls, saved results to JSON files, and identified crucial findings. Most importantly, the searches discovered that there IS a Polish adaptation called 'Wszyscy kochają Romana' (Everybody Loves Roman) and identified the key actor: **Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski** who plays the Ray character (Roman) in the Polish version. This critical information was found in Search 3, Result 1 from Wikipedia. The **PLAN** objective has been achieved - we found the actor who played Ray in the Polish version. However, since the output contains extensive search results (200+ lines) with valuable research data, I recommend saving a summary of key findings to 'workspace/raymond_polish_actor_summary.txt' to document that Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski is the answer to the research question.",
