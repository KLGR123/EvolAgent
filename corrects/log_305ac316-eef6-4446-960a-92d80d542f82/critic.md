## Final Answer
```
Wojciech
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the first name of the character played in 'Magda M.' by the actor who portrayed Ray in the Polish version of 'Everybody Loves Raymond'. This requires two-step research: (1) identifying the Polish Ray actor, and (2) finding their character in 'Magda M.' Member evaluation reveals significant contradiction requiring resolution. Member 1 conducted systematic research identifying the Polish adaptation 'Wszyscy kochają Romana' (2011-2012) with Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski playing Roman (Ray equivalent), then confirmed through multiple authoritative sources (Filmweb, IMDb, Polish entertainment articles) that Kasprzykowski played Wojciech Płaska in 'Magda M.' (2005-2007). Member 2 identified Cezary Pazura as the Polish voice actor for Ray dubbing and claimed he played 'Piotr' in 'Magda M.' - however, this confuses voice dubbing with the actual Polish adaptation. Member 3 reached identical conclusions to Member 1, confirming Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski as the Polish Ray actor and Wojciech Płaska as his 'Magda M.' character through independent verification via Wikipedia and IMDb. Cross-analysis shows Members 1 and 3 converge on comprehensive, methodologically sound research with multiple source verification, while Member 2's approach conflates dubbing with adaptation. Resolution: Members 1 and 3 correctly identified that Poland had an actual TV series adaptation rather than just voice dubbing. Their evidence from authoritative Polish entertainment databases, Wikipedia, and IMDb provides definitive confirmation. Final validation confirms Wojciech as the first name of the character Wojciech Płaska played by Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski in 'Magda M.'
