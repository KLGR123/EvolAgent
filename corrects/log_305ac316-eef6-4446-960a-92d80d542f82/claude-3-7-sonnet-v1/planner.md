### Van Helsing’s Șirnea Vampire Puzzle: Determining Vampire Count via Truth and Lies

**TASK**: You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.

You travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.

In the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: "How many vampires are living in Șirnea". Everyone in the village gives the same response, "At least one of us is a human."

How many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?

    "description": "This is a classic logic puzzle that can be solved through logical deduction without requiring external research or computation. Let me analyze the scenario: (1) All 100 residents give the same answer: 'At least one of us is a human', (2) We know humans always tell the truth and vampires always lie, (3) If any humans exist in the village, then the statement 'At least one of us is a human' would be true, and humans would say it truthfully, (4) However, if vampires also say this same statement, they must be lying (since vampires always lie), which means the statement must be false, (5) For the statement to be false, there would need to be zero humans in the village, (6) But this creates a contradiction - if there are no humans, then vampires saying 'At least one of us is a human' would be telling the truth, which vampires cannot do, (7) The only logical resolution is that there must be exactly 99 vampires and 1 human - the human tells the truth about at least one human existing, while the 99 vampires lie by claiming the same thing (their lie being that they are implying they themselves might be the human). Final answer: 99 residents have been turned into vampires.",

### Determining Number of Potato Bags Needed for Family Reunion Mashed Potatoes

**TASK**: My family reunion is this week, and I was assigned the mashed potatoes to bring. The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma and her brother, her brother's daughter, and his daughter's family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato of mashed potatoes, except my second cousins don't eat carbs. The average potato is about half a pound, and potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. How many whole bags of potatoes do I need? Just give the number.
