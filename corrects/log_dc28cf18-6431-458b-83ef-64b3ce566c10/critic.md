## Reasoning

Task analysis: Calculate potato bags needed for family reunion based on detailed attendee descriptions and consumption patterns (1.5 potatoes per adult, 0.5 per child, 0 for carb-free second cousins). Member 1 conducted systematic family tree mapping identifying 10 adults and 7 children (5 regular, 2 carb-free second cousins), calculating 17.5 total potatoes (8.75 lbs) requiring 2 bags. Member 2's approach was severely flawed - initial calculation counted only 5 adults and 2 kids, then attempted enumeration but produced fictional names (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dana, Evan) not matching the narrative, finally claiming 12 adults and 3 kids without proper justification. Member 3 performed comprehensive analysis identifying 11 adults and 6 children (3 carb-eating, 3 carb-free second cousins), calculating 18 potatoes (9 lbs) requiring 2 bags. Convergence analysis: Members 1 and 3 both reached 2 bags through different but valid attendee counts, while Member 2's analysis contained fundamental errors. Cross-validation reveals the key challenge is interpreting 'her brother's daughter's family' - Member 1 counted this as 3 people (daughter + 2 parents of the 2 second cousins), while Member 3 counted as 5 people (daughter + spouse + 3 children). Both interpretations are reasonable given the ambiguous wording. However, Member 3's interpretation aligns better with the phrase 'her daughter's family' implying nuclear family unit. Integration assessment: Member 3's methodology demonstrates superior systematic analysis with proper family relationship mapping and dietary restriction handling. Final validation: 11 adults × 1.5 + 3 children × 0.5 = 18 potatoes = 9 lbs, requiring ceiling(9/5) = 2 bags.
