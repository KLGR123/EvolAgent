# Developer Plan #4 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** dc28cf18-6431-458b-83ef-64b3ce566c10  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 4  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 04:45:56

## Plan Content
```
Manually enumerate each attending individual from the narrative description, assign each person to one of the categories “adult eater,” “kid eater,” or “kid non-eater (second cousin),” and produce the total count of adult eaters and kid eaters.
```

## Plan Description
```
This enumeration is necessary because the narrative is the only source of who is attending; categorizing each person into eater vs. non-eater yields the precise counts of adults (1.5 potatoes each) and kids (0.5 potatoes each) required for the mashed-potato calculation. Establishing these counts corrects previous mistakes and directly enables the next step of computing total potatoes and the number of 5-lb bags.
```

    "description": 'Implementation rationale:\n(1) Current task stage: We need to load the narrative of attending individuals and parse each person to determine their eater category. Since no narrative.txt file was found in workspace, a placeholder hard-coded narrative is used. The placeholder should be updated with the actual narrative description.\n(2) Approach: The script first checks for a file at workspace/narrative.txt; if missing, it uses a multi-line string where each line follows one of the patterns: "Name - category", "Name: category", or "Name (category)". It then uses a regular expression to extract the name and the category, normalizes categories into exactly three labels ("adult eater", "kid eater", "kid non-eater"), and falls back to keyword detection if the regex fails.\n(3) This advances the PLAN by embedding narrative loading, parsing logic, and classification + counting of adult and kid eaters, fulfilling steps 1–3 of the tester’s feedback.\n(4) Relationship to previous iterations: The last iteration only listed workspace files. This iteration now implements the core parsing and counting logic, moving towards full PLAN compliance.\n(5) File outputs created in workspace/:\n    • attendee_classification.json – list of parsed attendees with their categories\n    • attendee_counts.txt         – summary counts of adult eaters and kid eaters\n\nNext: Replace the placeholder narrative in the script or create workspace/narrative.txt with the actual narrative description so the parsing produces the correct results and final counts.',
