## Plan Content
```
Create a systematic family tree analysis to determine the exact number of adults and children attending the family reunion. Map out all family relationships based on the given information: married mother and father, twin brother and his family, aunt and her family, grandma and her brother, her brother's daughter and her daughter's family. Account for the deceased grandpa and grandma's sister-in-law, ensuring all living spouses are counted. Identify which children are second cousins who don't eat carbs. Calculate total potato consumption using 1.5 potatoes per adult and 0.5 potatoes per child (excluding carb-free second cousins), then determine the number of 5-pound bags needed given that average potato weighs 0.5 pounds.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal approach because: (1) The task requires careful family relationship mapping to count attendees accurately, (2) No previous analysis exists, (3) Expected outcome is to systematically identify all family members, categorize adults vs children, and calculate potato requirements, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to determine the number of potato bags needed through logical analysis and mathematical calculation

Starting by mapping out all the family relationships mentioned in the PLAN: (1) Core family unit with married mother and father, (2) Twin brother and his family, (3) Aunt and her family, (4) Grandma and her living brother, (5) Grandma's brother's daughter and her family, while noting deceased members won't attend. I'm establishing reasonable family structures with children, identifying second cousins (children of Grandma's brother's daughter) as the carb-free ones who don't eat potatoes. Then calculating total potato consumption using 1.5 potatoes per adult and 0.5 per regular child, converting to weight (0.5 lbs per potato), and determining how many 5-pound bags are needed.
