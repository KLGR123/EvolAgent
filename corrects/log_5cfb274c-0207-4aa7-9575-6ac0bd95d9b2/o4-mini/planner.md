## Task Description
```
Each cell in the attached spreadsheet represents a plot of land. The color of the cell indicates who owns that plot. Green cells are plots owned by Earl Smith. Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking? For this question, consider backtracking to be any instance where Earl would enter a plot of land he had already entered since leaving his starting plot.

### Determine missing edge piece’s two colors in jumbled Rubik’s Cube puzzle

**TASK**: A standard Rubik’s cube has been broken into cubes making up its sides. The cubes are jumbled, and one is removed. There are 6 cubes with one colored face, 12 edge cubes with two colored faces, and 8 corner cubes with three colored faces. All blue cubes have been found. All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube. The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow. For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found. The removed cube has two colors on its faces. What are they? Answer using a comma separated list, with the colors ordered alphabetically.

    "plan": "Analyze the Rubik's cube structure and systematically determine which cubes have been found based on the given constraints. Start by establishing the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cube composition: 6 center cubes (one colored face each), 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each), and 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each). Then work through each constraint: (1) All blue cubes found, (2) All cubes adjacent to orange center found plus orange center itself, (3) All green corners found, (4) All green that borders yellow found, (5) For all found orange cubes, their opposite face cubes are also found. Create a logical framework to track which specific cubes remain unfound, focusing on the edge cubes since the removed cube has exactly two colors. Determine the colors of the missing edge cube by process of elimination.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first approach because: (1) The task requires systematic logical deduction about cube positions and colors in a standard Rubik's cube, (2) No previous analysis exists in the history, (3) Expected outcome is to establish the cube structure and systematically apply the given constraints, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to identify the two colors on the removed cube through logical elimination",

    "description": "The **PLAN** has been successfully completed. The systematic analysis of the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube structure determined that exactly one edge cube is missing: 'White-Green' with colors White and Green. The analysis was accomplished through the following steps: (1) Established the standard cube composition with 6 centers, 12 edges, and 8 corners, (2) Applied all five constraints systematically to identify found cubes, (3) Used process of elimination to determine missing cubes, and (4) Verified that only one edge cube remains unfound. The tester has confirmed the analysis is correct and complete. The missing cube with exactly two colors has been definitively identified as having White and Green colors. All output files have been saved to workspace/rubiks_cube_analysis.json for reference.",

### Find minimum cell towers to cover all houses within 4-mile road radius.

**TASK**: You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. In the reference file is a layout of the road and nearby houses. Each dash, "-", is a marker indicating a mile. Each capital H indicates a house located next to a mile marker, appearing above or below the stretch of road. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt
