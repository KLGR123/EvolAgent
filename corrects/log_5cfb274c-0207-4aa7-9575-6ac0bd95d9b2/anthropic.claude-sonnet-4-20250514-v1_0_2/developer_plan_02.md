# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 5cfb274c-0207-4aa7-9575-6ac0bd95d9b2  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 00:44:09

## Plan Content
```
Solve the Hamiltonian path problem to determine if Earl can walk through every plot he owns exactly once and return to his starting plot without backtracking. Using the identified 49 green plots from the previous analysis, construct a graph where each plot is a node and edges connect adjacent plots (horizontally and vertically neighboring cells). Apply graph theory algorithms to check if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in Earl's connected land area, considering movement constraints between adjacent plots only.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have the complete mapping of Earl's 49 land plots from the previous Excel analysis, (2) The core question about traversing all plots without backtracking remains unanswered - this is a classic Hamiltonian cycle problem, (3) Expected outcome is a definitive yes/no answer with path verification if one exists, (4) This directly addresses the main TASK requirement to determine if Earl can complete the specified traversal

    "description": "Implementing the core Hamiltonian cycle detection algorithm using backtracking to determine if Earl can walk through all 49 plots exactly once and return to his starting point. The algorithm systematically explores all possible paths through the graph, checking at each step whether a valid Hamiltonian cycle exists. For each potential path, it verifies that: (1) each next plot is adjacent to the current plot, (2) no plot is visited twice, and (3) the final plot connects back to the starting plot to complete the cycle. This is the definitive test to answer Earl's question about whether his desired walking route is mathematically possible given the adjacency constraints of his land layout. The backtracking approach will either find a valid cycle path or prove that none exists.",

Verified the graph is connected (essential prerequisite for Hamiltonian cycle possibility).\n\n3. **Hamiltonian Cycle Detection (✅ Complete)**: Implemented backtracking algorithm that systematically explored all possible paths through Earl's connected land area. The algorithm completed efficiently in 0.050 seconds and definitively determined that no Hamiltonian cycle exists.\n\n**Technical Results:**\n- Graph structure: 49 nodes, 58 edges, average degree 2.37\n- Graph connectivity: CONNECTED (necessary condition met)\n- Hamiltonian cycle: DOES NOT EXIST (sufficient condition failed)\n- Algorithm: Backtracking with complete path exploration\n- Computation time: 0.050 seconds\n\n**Practical Implications for Earl:**\nEarl's desired walking route is mathematically impossible given his land layout. The adjacency constraints of his 49 plots do not permit a path that visits each plot exactly once and returns to the starting point. Earl would need to either:\n- Accept visiting some plots more than once during his walk, or\n- Accept not returning to his starting plot (pursue a Hamiltonian path instead of cycle)\n\n**Output Files Created:**\n- `workspace/earl_hamiltonian_graph.json`: Complete graph structure and adjacency data\n- `workspace/hamiltonian_cycle_results.json`: Detailed algorithm results and conclusions\n\nThe graph theory analysis is complete and the Hamiltonian path problem has been definitively solved. No further algorithmic analysis is required.",
