## Final Answer
```
Santa Clara, Boston
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the westernmost and easternmost university cities where US Secretaries of Homeland Security (prior to April 2019, excluding acting secretaries) obtained bachelor's degrees. All three members identified the secretaries and their bachelor's degrees, though with slight differences in their lists. Member 1 and 2 identified the westernmost university as Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, CA (longitude approximately -121.94°) and the easternmost as University of Massachusetts Boston in Boston, MA (longitude approximately -71.04°). Member 3 identified Santa Clara University correctly as westernmost but incorrectly listed Harvard University in Cambridge, MA (longitude approximately -71.11°) as easternmost, overlooking UMass Boston. Cross-analysis reveals strong agreement on Santa Clara University being westernmost, but divergence on the easternmost university between Boston and Cambridge. Verification confirms that UMass Boston (longitude -71.04°) is indeed slightly east of Harvard University (longitude -71.11°), making Boston the correct easternmost city. Further verification confirms John F. Kelly attended UMass Boston as Members 1 and 2 correctly identified. Member 3 appears to have missed including John F. Kelly in their final analysis despite initially listing him in their research. Integration of the most reliable elements from Members 1 and 2's analyses confirms the final answer as 'Santa Clara, Boston' with high confidence.
