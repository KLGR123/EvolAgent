# Developer Plan #3 - claude-3-7-sonnet-v1

**Task ID:** 65da0822-a48a-4a68-bbad-8ed1b835a834  
**Model:** claude-3-7-sonnet-v1

## Plan Content
```
Research the geographic locations of all universities where former US Secretaries of Homeland Security (who served prior to April 2019, excluding acting secretaries) obtained their bachelor's degrees. Identify the longitude and latitude coordinates for each university to determine which is the westernmost and which is the easternmost.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal next step because: (1) We've already identified all six formal Secretaries and their bachelor's degree universities, (2) The previous developer work confirmed these universities as Harvard (Ridge, Chertoff), Santa Clara University, Morehouse College, University of Massachusetts Boston, and Georgetown University, (3) Expected outcome is the geographic coordinates of each university to determine westernmost and easternmost locations, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK requirement of identifying the westernmost and easternmost universities by city location.

    "description": "This implementation researches the geographic locations of universities where former US Secretaries of Homeland Security (prior to April 2019) obtained their bachelor's degrees, then determines which is the westernmost and easternmost based on longitude coordinates.\n\nThe script follows these key steps:\n\n1. Creates a list of the six Secretaries of Homeland Security who served before April 2019 (excluding acting secretaries)\n2. Maps each secretary to their bachelor's degree alma mater and location\n3. Uses the geopy library with Nominatim geocoding service to determine the longitude and latitude coordinates for each university\n4. Finds the westernmost and easternmost universities by comparing longitude values\n5. Saves the results to both JSON and CSV files in the workspace directory\n\nThe implementation includes detailed print statements throughout the execution to show progress and intermediate results. I've incorporated proper error handling for the geocoding process, which can sometimes fail due to network issues or incomplete information. The script also includes a delay between geocoding requests to avoid rate limiting.\n\nThe results will provide a comprehensive analysis of the geographic distribution of these universities, identifying which former Secretary attended the westernmost and easternmost institutions by longitude.",

    "feedback": "Execution mostly successful - The code ran with some minor issues and completed the core objectives of the PLAN. The script successfully identified and researched the geographic locations of universities attended by former US Secretaries of Homeland Security before April 2019. The output correctly identified Santa Clara University (Janet Napolitano) as the westernmost at longitude -121.936544 and UMass Boston (John F. Kelly) as the easternmost at longitude -71.0387132. There was one issue: coordinates for Georgetown University School of Foreign Service (Kirstjen Nielsen) could not be retrieved, so this university was excluded from the westernmost/easternmost comparison. The code also shows some USGS API errors that don't appear to impact the final result. Results were successfully saved to JSON and CSV files. The PLAN requirements have been substantially met despite the one missing coordinate set. Suggestion: Try modifying the Georgetown University query to use just 'Georgetown University' without the school name, which might yield successful geocoding results.",

    "description": 'I\'ve improved the script based on the tester\'s feedback to address the issue with Georgetown University\'s coordinates. The main changes include:\n\n1. Modified Kirstjen Nielsen\'s education data to use "Georgetown University" instead of "Georgetown University School of Foreign Service" to improve geocoding success\n\n2. Added an additional geocoding attempt specifically for Georgetown University that tries a more generic query format when the initial attempts fail\n\n3. Added verbose logging in the find_extremes() function to better show which universities are being processed and which ones are skipped due to missing coordinates\n\n4. Maintained the core functionality that worked well in the previous version, including the ability to identify Santa Clara University as the westernmost and University of Massachusetts Boston as the easternmost\n\nThe improved script should now be able to successfully geocode all six universities, ensuring a more complete analysis. The results will still be saved to both JSON and CSV files in the workspace directory, providing a comprehensive record of each secretary\'s education and the geographic extremes of their alma maters.',

The script successfully retrieved the geographic locations for all six former US Secretaries of Homeland Security who served prior to April 2019. The previous issue with Georgetown University was resolved by modifying the university name from 'Georgetown University School of Foreign Service' to just 'Georgetown University', which allowed successful geocoding. The analysis correctly identified Santa Clara University (Janet Napolitano) as the westernmost university at longitude -121.936544 and University of Massachusetts Boston (John F.
