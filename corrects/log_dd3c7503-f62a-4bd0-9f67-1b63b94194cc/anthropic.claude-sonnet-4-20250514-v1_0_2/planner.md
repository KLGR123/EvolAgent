I have a gallon of honey and a gallon of mayonnaise at 25C. I remove one cup of honey at a time from the gallon of honey. How many times will I need to remove a cup to have the honey weigh less than the mayonaise? Assume the containers themselves weigh the same.

### Compute odds of today’s Sunset Picnic Trip using a steam locomotive

**TASK**: The attached file lists the locomotives owned by a local railroad museum. It gives each locomotive’s identifying number, operating status, and the name of the daily excursion it heads, if operational. What are the odds that today’s Sunset Picnic Trip will use a steam locomotive? Assume that each day’s excursion picks one of its assigned locomotives at random, and express the answer in the form “1 in 4”, “1 in 5”, etc. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/4d0aa727-86b1-406b-9b33-f870dd14a4a5.xlsx

The locomotive types were correctly classified using wheel configuration patterns for steam locomotives and model designations for diesel locomotives. The probability analysis was completed showing 1 steam locomotive versus 2 diesel locomotives on the Sunset Picnic Trip, resulting in 33.3% probability for steam, 66.7% probability for diesel, with odds ratio of 1:2 (steam:diesel).
