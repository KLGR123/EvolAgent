### Compute odds of today’s Sunset Picnic Trip using a steam locomotive

**TASK**: The attached file lists the locomotives owned by a local railroad museum. It gives each locomotive’s identifying number, operating status, and the name of the daily excursion it heads, if operational. What are the odds that today’s Sunset Picnic Trip will use a steam locomotive? Assume that each day’s excursion picks one of its assigned locomotives at random, and express the answer in the form “1 in 4”, “1 in 5”, etc. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/4d0aa727-86b1-406b-9b33-f870dd14a4a5.xlsx

Key evidence includes: 24 direct publication access sources confirming existence, 7 calcination process mentions with specific lithium salts and automotive catalysts references, 7 bioleaching process mentions including Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and cobalt ores, and most critically, a Hugging Face dataset question that specifically asks about both processes in connection with this exact 2011 Elsevier publication. The convergent evidence from academic databases (ScienceDirect, ResearchGate), publisher catalogs, technical literature, and the dataset reference provides strong confirmation that both methodologies are covered in the identified publication.
