# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** dd3c7503-f62a-4bd0-9f67-1b63b94194cc  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-31 20:33:26

## Plan Content
```
Calculate how many cups of honey need to be removed from a gallon of honey so that the remaining honey weighs less than a gallon of mayonnaise. Use the verified density values from the LibreTexts materials: honey density 1.420 g/cm³ and mayonnaise density 0.910 g/cm³ at 25°C. Convert gallon and cup measurements to consistent units, calculate the initial weights of both substances, then determine how many 1-cup removals are needed until the remaining honey weight becomes less than the mayonnaise weight.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal next step because: (1) We have successfully obtained the required density values from the LibreTexts chemistry materials as specified in the TASK, (2) The developer confirmed honey density is 1.420 g/cm³ and mayonnaise density is 0.910 g/cm³ at 25°C from the CK-12 licensed materials, (3) Expected outcome is the exact number of cup removals needed to make the honey weigh less than the mayonnaise, (4) This directly solves the mathematical problem posed in the TASK using the verified chemistry data from the specified academic source.

### Development Step 1: Family Reunion Attendance Analysis and Potato Needs in 5-Pound Bags

**Description**: Systematically analyze the family reunion attendee list to determine the exact number of adults and children attending. Parse through each family group mentioned: (1) Your parents (married mother and father), (2) Your twin brother and his family (brother + spouse + 2 children), (3) Your aunt and her family (aunt + spouse + 1 six-year-old), (4) Your grandma and her brother, (5) Her brother's daughter and her family (daughter + spouse + 3 kids under 12), plus yourself. Account for the deceased members (grandpa and grandma's sister-in-law) and the special dietary restriction (second cousins don't eat carbs). Calculate total potato consumption using the given rates: 1.5 potatoes per adult, 0.5 potatoes per child (except carb-free second cousins), convert to pounds using 0.5 pounds per potato, and determine how many 5-pound bags are needed.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate retreat catering and side-dish provisioning for a multinational team with low-carb and child-friendly meal options
- Summer camp weekly meal planning and potato supply calculation for campers, counselors, and gluten-free participants
- Wedding reception menu and ingredient ordering automation accounting for adults, children, and guests with dietary restrictions
- School field trip lunch box assembly and snack pack distribution for students with allergen exclusions and teacher chaperones
- Hospital inpatient meal scheduling and tuber-based side dish forecasting across adult and pediatric wards with diabetic diet exclusions
- Military training camp mess hall resource forecasting and bulk potato ordering considering soldiers and trainees on low‐carb rations
- Non-profit community soup kitchen stock planning and vegetable procurement tailored to adult visitors, families, and carb-free volunteers
- Restaurant chain brunch service potato side dish inventory management and automated ordering report generation for multiple locations

### Development Step 2: Calculate ISBN-10 Check Digit for Tropicos ID 100370510

**Description**: Calculate the ISBN-10 check digit for the Tropicos ID 100370510. Apply the standard ISBN-10 check digit algorithm: multiply each digit by its position weight (1st digit × 10, 2nd digit × 9, 3rd digit × 8, etc.), sum all products, find the remainder when divided by 11, and determine the check digit (0-9 or X for remainder 10). Save the complete calculation process and final check digit result to workspace for verification.

**Use Cases**:
- Library cataloging validation and metadata enrichment for herbarium specimens using Tropicos IDs to generate accurate ISBN-10 entries and avoid data entry errors
- Automated ISBN-10 generation in publishing house workflows when referencing Tropicos plant identifiers in monographs to ensure compliance with international book numbering standards
- Batch integration of Tropicos-to-ISBN-10 conversion in online botanical bookstores to synchronize product listings with global bibliographic databases and improve search accuracy
- Migration of legacy botanical database records by verifying and appending ISBN-10 check digits to Tropicos IDs, preserving data integrity during system upgrades
- Embedding ISBN-10 check digit calculations in university citation management tools for researchers citing plant taxonomy sources, reducing manual correction time in bibliographies
- Digital archiving scripts for botanical gardens that process Tropicos specimen IDs, automatically computing and storing ISBN-10 numbers for public access repositories
- Nightly quality assurance tasks in taxonomic publishing platforms that recalculate ISBN-10 check digits for new plant taxonomy publications, flagging discrepancies for editorial review
- Teaching computer science and data validation principles by demonstrating the ISBN-10 check digit algorithm on real-world Tropicos IDs in academic programming courses

### Development Step 6: ASEAN Capitals Distance Matrix and Farthest Pair Identification via Haversine Formula

**Description**: Calculate the geographical distances between all possible pairs of ASEAN capital cities using the coordinate data from workspace/asean_complete_coordinates.json. Apply the haversine formula to compute great circle distances between each pair of capitals, then identify which two countries have the maximum distance between their capital cities. Create a comprehensive distance matrix showing all pairwise distances and determine the two ASEAN member countries whose capitals are geographically furthest apart.

**Use Cases**:
- Logistics route optimization for freight companies calculating the shortest shipping legs between ASEAN capitals to minimize transit time and fuel costs
- Government travel coordination for foreign affairs offices scheduling official visits and arranging the most efficient travel routes between member-state capitals
- Travel agency itinerary planning for multi-city Southeast Asia tours, using capital-to-capital distances to design balanced schedules and pricing models
- Emergency response modeling for disaster relief organizations estimating rapid deployment times between ASEAN capitals during regional crises
- Airline network analysis for carriers evaluating the feasibility and demand of direct flights connecting underserved ASEAN capitals
- Retail distribution strategy for consumer goods companies determining optimal warehouse locations based on proximity to multiple ASEAN capitals
- Sports event logistics planning for regional tournaments, coordinating team travel and accommodation by assessing inter-capital distances
- Environmental impact studies for researchers mapping pollutant dispersion corridors between capitals to inform cross-border air quality policies

    "description": 'Implementation of honey vs mayonnaise weight calculation using verified LibreTexts density values. This code systematically calculates how many cups of honey must be removed from an initial gallon so that the remaining honey weighs less than a gallon of mayonnaise. The approach includes: (1) Setting up verified density values (honey 1.420 g/cm³, mayonnaise 0.910 g/cm³), (2) Converting gallon and cup volumes to consistent cm³ units, (3) Calculating initial weights of both substances, (4) Determining weight reduction per cup of honey removed, (5) Computing exact cups needed and rounding up to whole cups, (6) Verifying the final result meets the weight requirement, and (7) Saving detailed calculations to workspace files. The code includes comprehensive print statements for debugging and creates both JSON and text output files for result verification.',

    "description": 'Task completion confirmed. The HISTORY shows that the previous code execution was completely successful and fulfilled all PLAN requirements. The calculation determined that exactly 6 cups of honey need to be removed from a gallon of honey so that the remaining honey weighs less than a gallon of mayonnaise. The solution used verified LibreTexts density values (honey: 1.420 g/cm³, mayonnaise: 0.910 g/cm³), performed accurate unit conversions, showed step-by-step mathematical calculations, and included proper verification. The results showed that after removing 6 cups, the remaining honey weighs 3359.55g which is indeed less than the mayonnaise weight of 3444.72g. The code also confirmed that 5 cups would be insufficient (3695.51g > 3444.72g), validating that 6 cups is the minimum required. Detailed calculation results were successfully saved to workspace files (honey_mayonnaise_calculation.json and honey_calculation_summary.txt). The tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with no further development needed. Final answer: 6 cups of honey must be removed.',
