# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Execute the extracted Python script workspace/extracted_python_script.py against the provided array of strings to generate the URL containing C++ source code. Use the exact array: ['_alg', 'ghi', 'C++', 'jkl', 'tps', '/Q', 'pqr', 'stu', ':', '//', 'rose', 'vwx', 'yz1', '234', 'tta', '567', '890', 'cod', 'e.', 'or', 'g/', 'wiki', '/', 'ing', 'sort', 'abc', 'or', 'it', 'hms', 'mno', 'uic', 'ksort', '#', 'ht']. Capture the output URL and save it to workspace/generated_url.txt for the next step.

## Description
This is the next logical step because: (1) We have successfully extracted the Python script from the image and need to run it with the given string array, (2) The previous step completed the image analysis and script extraction, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the URL that contains the C++ source code, (4) This progresses toward the TASK goal of eventually compiling and running the C++ code against the integer array.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Parse and analyze Python script to understand logic and compute its final numeric result.

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Python code file data/gaia/2023/validation/f918266a-b3e0-4914-865d-4faa564f1aef.py to understand its structure and logic. Read the complete code content, identify the main execution flow, trace through any calculations or operations, and determine what the final numeric output will be when this code is executed.

**Use Cases**:
- Regulatory compliance audit of Python-based trading algorithms by analyzing code structure, dependencies, and operations for financial institutions
- Automated pre-merge code review in a DevOps CI/CD pipeline to detect unauthorized imports and enforce coding standards for enterprise software teams
- Generation of summary reports on data processing scripts in a bioinformatics research lab to validate function usage, mathematical operations, and workflow consistency
- Static analysis of configuration and orchestration scripts in cloud infrastructure repositories to identify potential security vulnerabilities and resource misconfigurations
- Automated grading and feedback for computer science students by parsing submitted Python assignments, checking for required functions, loops, and print statements
- Quality assurance for educational content platforms by scanning tutorial code examples to ensure consistency, presence of docstrings, and accurate execution flow descriptions
- Code migration and refactoring planning for legacy systems by inventorying existing Python modules, mapping variable assignments and control structures, and estimating complexity
- Documentation generation for an open-source machine learning library by extracting function and class definitions, usage examples, and operation details from source files

### Development Step 1: Excel Grid Parsing: Record Cell Coordinates, Text, Fill Colors, Identify START and END Cells

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx to extract the complete grid structure: record for each cell its row–column coordinate, displayed text, and fill color as a 6-digit hex code, then identify the coordinates of the cell containing 'START' and the cell containing 'END'.

**Use Cases**:
- Project timeline extraction for construction management: parse a color-coded Gantt chart in Excel to import each task’s grid position, label, and scheduling colors, then automatically locate the “START” kickoff milestone and “END” completion point.
- Retail shelf planogram automation: extract the full store shelving grid with product names and color-coded stock levels from an Excel layout, identify the beginning (“START”) and end (“END”) of each aisle for dynamic planogram updates.
- AGV navigation map generation in manufacturing: read an Excel-based factory floor grid with zones highlighted by fill color, output precise coordinates for every cell, and locate the “START” docking station and “END” delivery bay for autonomous guided vehicles.
- Classroom seating performance analysis: parse a teacher’s Excel seating chart where student names and test scores are color-coded, record each desk’s coordinates and find designated “START” and “END” rows for group activities arrangement.
- Game level prototyping: convert a level design represented in Excel cells (with obstacles and power-ups color-coded) into JSON; pinpoint the “START” spawn cell and “END” exit cell for rapid engine import.
- Real estate floorplan digitization: extract room labels, dimensions, and color-coded zones (e.g., living, kitchen, bedrooms) from an Excel blueprint, capturing each cell’s coordinates and fill color, then identify the main “START” entrance and emergency “END” exits.
- High-throughput screening data mapping in biotech: interpret a microtiter plate layout from Excel, record each well’s row–column address, sample identifier, and color-coded assay result, and locate the “START” reference well and “END” control well for automated analysis.
