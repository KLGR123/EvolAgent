# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png to extract and understand the Python script contained within it. Parse the image to read the Python code and save the extracted script to workspace/extracted_python_script.py for subsequent execution.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to extract the Python script from the image before we can execute it, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on the attached image file, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the readable Python code that will process the given string array, (4) This directly addresses the first requirement of the TASK - running the Python code against the provided array of strings.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Parse and analyze Python script to understand logic and compute its final numeric result.

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Python code file data/gaia/2023/validation/f918266a-b3e0-4914-865d-4faa564f1aef.py to understand its structure and logic. Read the complete code content, identify the main execution flow, trace through any calculations or operations, and determine what the final numeric output will be when this code is executed.

**Use Cases**:
- Regulatory compliance audit of Python-based trading algorithms by analyzing code structure, dependencies, and operations for financial institutions
- Automated pre-merge code review in a DevOps CI/CD pipeline to detect unauthorized imports and enforce coding standards for enterprise software teams
- Generation of summary reports on data processing scripts in a bioinformatics research lab to validate function usage, mathematical operations, and workflow consistency
- Static analysis of configuration and orchestration scripts in cloud infrastructure repositories to identify potential security vulnerabilities and resource misconfigurations
- Automated grading and feedback for computer science students by parsing submitted Python assignments, checking for required functions, loops, and print statements
- Quality assurance for educational content platforms by scanning tutorial code examples to ensure consistency, presence of docstrings, and accurate execution flow descriptions
- Code migration and refactoring planning for legacy systems by inventorying existing Python modules, mapping variable assignments and control structures, and estimating complexity
- Documentation generation for an open-source machine learning library by extracting function and class definitions, usage examples, and operation details from source files

### Development Step 2: Analyze Python code file to understand logic, trace execution, and find its final numeric output.

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Python code file data/gaia/2023/validation/f918266a-b3e0-4914-865d-4faa564f1aef.py to understand its structure and logic. Read the complete code content, identify the main execution flow, trace through any calculations or operations, and determine what the final numeric output will be when this code is executed.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated security auditing of financial services Python scripts to detect unexpected exception paths and harmful random value usages before deployment
- Integration into a CI/CD pipeline for e-commerce microservices to trace code flow changes and prevent regressions in discount calculation logic
- Pre-release validation of healthcare analytics tools, ensuring that data sampling routines (randomized values) meet compliance criteria and don’t silently fail
- Educational platform feature that step-by-step parses student-submitted Python assignments, highlighting execution flow and exception handling for teaching programming concepts
- Quality assurance automation in IoT firmware code, analyzing logic paths that generate sensor threshold alerts to catch misconfigurations early
- Documentation generator for enterprise DevOps teams that reads source files, maps function and class structures, and produces human-readable execution overviews
- Research lab tool to validate stochastic simulation scripts by tracing random number generation criteria and logging first valid outcomes for reproducibility
- Government software compliance verifier that parses public sector codebases, traces exception-raising conditions, and produces audit-ready reports of code logic paths

### Development Step 2: Parse Excel File for Cell Coordinates, Text, Fill Colors, and ‘START’/‘END’ Locations

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx to extract the complete grid structure: record for each cell its row–column coordinate, displayed text, and fill color as a 6-digit hex code, then identify the coordinates of the cell containing 'START' and the cell containing 'END'.

**Use Cases**:
- Warehouse AGV route optimization and automated navigation using Excel grid layouts; extract cell coordinates, fill colors for storage zones, and identify START (loading bay) and END (docking station)
- Video game level map ingestion and design automation by parsing Excel-based tile grids, reading cell colors for terrain types, and locating START/END spawn points
- Construction site safety path planning with hazard zone extraction from color-coded Excel floor plans; determine safe route from START (entrance) to END (exit)
- Manufacturing line process monitoring by parsing Excel diagrams of assembly stations, capturing status color codes, and locating START and END of the production flow
- Clinical laboratory sample rack layout processing; read Excel grid to map sample positions by fill-color status and identify START (first sample) and END (last sample) wells for automated pipetting
- Research experiment plate map analysis for high-throughput screening; extract cell coordinates and reagent status colors, then pinpoint START and END wells for liquid handling robots
- Event seating arrangement and attendee flow mapping by parsing color-coded Excel seating charts; extract seat coordinates and colors for zones, identifying START (entry gate) and END (exit gate) points

### Development Step 1: Excel Grid Parsing: Record Cell Coordinates, Text, Fill Colors, Identify START and END Cells

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx to extract the complete grid structure: record for each cell its row–column coordinate, displayed text, and fill color as a 6-digit hex code, then identify the coordinates of the cell containing 'START' and the cell containing 'END'.

**Use Cases**:
- Project timeline extraction for construction management: parse a color-coded Gantt chart in Excel to import each task’s grid position, label, and scheduling colors, then automatically locate the “START” kickoff milestone and “END” completion point.
- Retail shelf planogram automation: extract the full store shelving grid with product names and color-coded stock levels from an Excel layout, identify the beginning (“START”) and end (“END”) of each aisle for dynamic planogram updates.
- AGV navigation map generation in manufacturing: read an Excel-based factory floor grid with zones highlighted by fill color, output precise coordinates for every cell, and locate the “START” docking station and “END” delivery bay for autonomous guided vehicles.
- Classroom seating performance analysis: parse a teacher’s Excel seating chart where student names and test scores are color-coded, record each desk’s coordinates and find designated “START” and “END” rows for group activities arrangement.
- Game level prototyping: convert a level design represented in Excel cells (with obstacles and power-ups color-coded) into JSON; pinpoint the “START” spawn cell and “END” exit cell for rapid engine import.
- Real estate floorplan digitization: extract room labels, dimensions, and color-coded zones (e.g., living, kitchen, bedrooms) from an Excel blueprint, capturing each cell’s coordinates and fill color, then identify the main “START” entrance and emergency “END” exits.
- High-throughput screening data mapping in biotech: interpret a microtiter plate layout from Excel, record each well’s row–column address, sample identifier, and color-coded assay result, and locate the “START” reference well and “END” control well for automated analysis.
