Based on the **HISTORY** feedback from the tester, the image analysis and Python code extraction task has been accomplished with 100% alignment to the **PLAN** requirements. The script successfully: (1) Analyzed the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png using OpenAI's vision API, (2) Extracted the complete Python script code contained within the image with perfect accuracy, (3) Saved the extracted code to workspace/extracted_python_script.py as required. The extracted Python code contains 4 lines with 234 characters, including variables for archive_prefix, url_indices array, URL construction logic using string joining, and a print statement. The tester confirmed that the API response was properly parsed, the code was correctly saved, and file verification shows successful creation with proper content. No further development is needed as the **PLAN** objective has been achieved completely.",
