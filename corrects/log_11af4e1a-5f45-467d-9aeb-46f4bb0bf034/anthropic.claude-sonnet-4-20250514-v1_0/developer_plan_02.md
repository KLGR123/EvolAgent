# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 11af4e1a-5f45-467d-9aeb-46f4bb0bf034  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-28 17:25:10

## Plan Content
```
Search for detailed information about the Transformer architecture from the 'Attention is All You Need' paper, specifically focusing on the number of encoder blocks/layers. Use search terms like 'Attention is All You Need encoder layers', 'Transformer original paper Vaswani encoder blocks', and 'Transformer architecture encoder depth'. Extract the exact number of encoder layers in the original Transformer model and verify this information from the original paper or authoritative sources.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have confirmed BERT base has 12 encoder layers from the previous search, (2) We now need the second piece of information to complete the comparison, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the exact number of encoder blocks/layers in the original Transformer architecture, (4) Once we have both numbers, we can calculate the difference to answer the TASK question
