### Absolute Difference in Tens of Thousands Between 2018 and 2020 Chinstrap Penguin Populations

**TASK**: What is the absolute difference in tens of thousands between the population of chinstrap penguins on the Wikipedia page for penguin species populations as of the end of 2018 and the population recorded in the Nature.com "global population assessment of the Chinstrap penguin" article from 2020, assuming two penguins per breeding pair?

The species is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List.\n\n**Measurement Type Confirmation**: The data explicitly states "specimens" indicating individual penguins rather than breeding pairs, which directly addresses the PLAN requirement to note whether the figure represents breeding pairs or individual penguins.\n\n**Research Process Summary**:\n1. Conducted systematic Google searches targeting Wikipedia pages with chinstrap penguin population data\n2. Identified 39 total search results across 4 targeted queries\n3. Located the primary Wikipedia page "Chinstrap penguin" containing the target information\n4. Fetched and parsed the HTML content using multiple extraction methods\n5. Applied regex pattern matching to isolate the specific 2018 IUCN population statement\n6. Verified the data through conservation status section analysis\n7. Compiled comprehensive documentation with full source attribution\n\n**Files Created**:\n- workspace/chinstrap_penguin_search_results.json (search data)\n- workspace/chinstrap_penguin_population_extraction.json (extraction results)\n- workspace/chinstrap_penguin_final_answer.json (complete final answer)\n- workspace/chinstrap_penguin.html (source Wikipedia page)\n- workspace/list_of_sphenisciformes_by_population.html (supporting page)\n\n**Confidence Level**: High - The information was extracted from an authoritative source (IUCN via Wikipedia) with clear 2018 attribution, specific numerical data, and explicit measurement type clarification.

    "description": "Task completion verified - The **PLAN** has been fully accomplished with authoritative results from the official U.S. Census Bureau API. The verification confirms that all objectives were successfully met: (1) Accessed data.census.gov via the official Census API to retrieve 2020 population data, (2) Successfully extracted Seattle's official 2020 census population of 737,015 (largest county seat by land area at 142.07 sq mi), (3) Successfully extracted Asotin's official 2020 census population of 1,204 (smallest county seat by land area at 1.02 sq mi), and (4) Calculated the integer difference as 735,811. The data extraction used the official 2020 Decennial Census API endpoint (https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/pl) with the P1_001N variable (Total Population) to query all places in Washington state (FIPS code 53). Both cities were found in the official census data with consistent results across multiple verification files. The final answer of 735,811 represents the integer difference between Seattle's population (737,015) and Asotin's population (1,204), calculated as 737,015 - 1,204 = 735,811. All results have been saved to workspace files including the comprehensive analysis (seattle_asotin_population_difference.json), raw census data (washington_places_2020_census.json), and the simple integer result (population_difference.txt). The task is complete with verified, authoritative census data.",
