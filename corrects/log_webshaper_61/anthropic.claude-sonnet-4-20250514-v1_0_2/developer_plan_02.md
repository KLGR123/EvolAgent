# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_61  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-12 04:43:46

## Plan Content
```
Conduct a targeted search specifically for the Sheki Khan's Palace construction timeline and completion date, focusing on identifying which building took eight years for decorative embellishment. Search for detailed historical records about 'Sheki Khan Palace construction date completion', 'Sheki Khan Palace eight years decorative work', 'Sheki Palace building timeline Azerbaijan', and 'Khan Palace Sheki construction history years'. Cross-reference multiple sources to determine the exact completion date of the palace that required eight years of decorative work, and verify if this matches the building with the blue-tiled minaret adjacent to the structure with over 5,000-piece Shebeke windows.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) Previous research successfully identified Sheki, Azerbaijan as the location and confirmed the Sheki Khan's Palace contains the described architectural features (Shebeke windows, mirrored balconies, wall paintings), (2) We now need to find the specific construction completion date for the building that required eight years of decorative embellishment, (3) Expected outcome is to determine the exact year when construction was completed after the eight-year decorative period, (4) This will directly answer the TASK question about when construction of this historically significant building was completed

### Development Step 21: Tahir Yuldashev‚Äôs Islamic Organization and the 1992 Crackdown Perpetrators

**Description**: Search for information about Tahir Yuldashev's biographical details, focusing on identifying the organization he co-founded and the specific group or leader who conducted the 1992 crackdown against this organization. Look for details about his role as a former Soviet paratrooper, the Islamic organization he helped establish, and which government forces, military units, or leaders were responsible for the crackdown that forced him to flee in 1992.

**Use Cases**:
- Counterterrorism intelligence gathering and automated profiling of extremist leaders for national security agencies
- Academic research on jihadist organizational structures and leadership biographical analysis for political science scholars
- Investigative journalism background verification and source validation for reporters covering Central Asia
- Legal due diligence and compliance risk assessment for financial institutions screening high-risk individuals
- Historical documentary archival research and fact extraction for filmmakers exploring post-Soviet conflicts
- OSINT-based threat monitoring and leadership tracking for defense contractors evaluating regional threats
- Geopolitical risk analysis and stakeholder mapping for multinational corporations planning Central Asian market entry
- Humanitarian program planning and partner vetting for NGOs operating in conflict zones with extremist activity

### Development Step 1: Identify China's 1997 Economic Crisis Triggering 287 Billion Yuan Infrastructure Investment

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the significant economic event that China faced in 1997, specifically focusing on the context surrounding China's allocation of 287 billion yuan for major construction projects during that year. Search for keywords including 'China 1997 economic crisis', 'Asian Financial Crisis 1997 China', 'China 287 billion yuan construction projects 1997', '1997 China economic stimulus', and 'China infrastructure investment 1997'. Focus on identifying the specific economic event or crisis that prompted this substantial government investment in construction and infrastructure projects.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated archival research on China‚Äôs 1997 stimulus: a policy historian uses the script to aggregate and score web documents about the 287 billion yuan construction package for a detailed crisis timeline
- Financial due diligence for infrastructure funds: an analyst leverages multi‚Äêengine searches and relevance scoring to verify historical Chinese stimulus measures before structuring new investment products
- Academic literature review on Asian Financial Crisis responses: a university researcher extracts and filters key indicators from global search results to support a peer‚Äêreviewed paper on East Asian policy interventions
- Government planning and risk assessment: a ministry economist integrates search outputs into a dashboard to compare past infrastructure investments during economic shocks for future stimulus planning
- Fact-checking in investigative journalism: a media outlet‚Äôs research team runs the pipeline to validate dates, amounts, and context of China‚Äôs 1997 spending claims across multiple sources
- Macroeconomic risk modeling for fintech: a quant team feeds the cleaned JSON search results into their models to correlate crisis keywords and capital allocations for stress‚Äêtesting portfolios
- Knowledge-graph population for AI assistants: a data engineer imports the structured search data into a corporate knowledge base to enable contextual queries about China‚Äôs 1997 stimulus measures

### Development Step 20: Find Tahir Yuldashev‚Äôs co-founded Islamic organization and the 1992 crackdown perpetrators

**Description**: Search for information about Tahir Yuldashev's biographical details, focusing on identifying the organization he co-founded and the specific group or leader who conducted the 1992 crackdown against this organization. Look for details about his role as a former Soviet paratrooper, the Islamic organization he helped establish, and which government forces, military units, or leaders were responsible for the crackdown that forced him to flee in 1992.

**Use Cases**:
- Political risk assessment for an international security consultancy, automatically extracting extremist leaders‚Äô organizational affiliations and crackdown timelines from archived search result JSON files
- Investigative journalism background verification, consolidating founders‚Äô biographical details, military service records, and government response events from web search snippets
- Academic research in Central Asian history, automating the reconstruction of political movement timelines by parsing biographical data from multiple search result dumps
- Compliance screening in a global bank, programmatically identifying potential sanctions risks by extracting individual affiliations and past government crackdowns from open-source search archives
- Corporate due diligence in mergers and acquisitions, building candidate and executive background profiles by analyzing historic search data for military service and leadership roles
- NGO partner vetting and security risk management, evaluating affiliations of potential collaborators through deep inspection of search-engine result metadata
- Counterterrorism intelligence operations, synthesizing open-source search snippets into structured profiles of militant group founders and their interactions with state actors
- Digital humanities archiving, enriching metadata for political figure collections by extracting verified biographical facts from legacy search result JSON datasets

Search for keywords including 'China 1997 economic crisis', 'Asian Financial Crisis 1997 China', 'China 287 billion yuan construction projects 1997', '1997 China economic stimulus', and 'China infrastructure investment 1997'. Focus on identifying the specific economic event or crisis that prompted this substantial government investment in construction and infrastructure projects.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical economic research for an academic paper analyzing China‚Äôs infrastructure spending response to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis
- Government policy evaluation by a fiscal oversight office assessing past stimulus effectiveness through automated search result analysis
- Risk management in a multinational corporation using historical crisis data to inform China market entry strategies
- Financial journalism investigation into China‚Äôs 287 billion yuan investment, extracting key findings for a news feature
- Economic consulting firm automating web‚Äêsearch analysis to benchmark China‚Äôs crisis interventions against other Asian economies
- University business school case study development on sovereign stimulus measures, leveraging structured search result summaries
- Data engineering pipeline integration to ingest search result JSON, filter for relevant economic events, and feed a BI dashboard
- Think-tank policy briefing preparation using synthesized insights on China‚Äôs 1997 stimulus to recommend future infrastructure programs

    "description": "Implementation of targeted web search for Sheki Khan's Palace construction timeline and completion date. This code executes 10 specialized search queries focused on identifying the building that took 8 years for decorative embellishment, cross-referencing construction dates, timeline details, and architectural features. The approach uses DDGS search engine with multiple backends (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Yahoo) to gather comprehensive information about the palace's construction history. Key features include: (1) Relevance scoring system based on construction timeline indicators, (2) Immediate analysis of search results for construction details, (3) Categorization of results by timeline mentions, decorative work, and architectural features, (4) Extraction of completion dates and 8-year construction references, (5) Structured JSON output saved to workspace for further analysis. The code specifically looks for connections between the 8-year decorative work timeline, blue-tiled minaret, and Shebeke windows to verify if they belong to the same building complex. Results are saved to timestamped files in workspace/ directory for cross-referencing multiple sources as specified in the PLAN.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code contains a critical bug that causes search failures. While the search setup and structure are correctly designed for the Sheki Khan's Palace research, there's a 'name 'text_to_check' is not defined' error occurring during result processing that breaks the search execution. The code successfully initiated searches and found some results (showing Palace of Shaki Khans Wikipedia page and other relevant sources), but the error prevents proper data collection and analysis. Additionally, there's a mismatch between the PLAN (Sheki Khan's Palace research) and the final output summary (which mentions Supermarine S.4 investigation), indicating the code may be using wrong variable references or templates. PLAN alignment: 10% - search queries are correctly targeted but execution fails due to the undefined variable error. Immediate fix needed: Remove or properly define the 'text_to_check' variable in the result processing section, and ensure all output references match the Sheki Khan's Palace research objective rather than aviation topics.",

Key findings include: (1) Four sources explicitly mention the 8-year decorative timeline, (2) Most sources agree on 1797 as the completion date, (3) The palace features intricate Shebeke windows made from thousands of glass pieces, (4) Construction was done without nails. The analysis successfully answers the PLAN's research question by identifying the Sheki Khan Palace as the building that required eight years for decorative embellishment, with strong evidence from multiple cross-referenced sources.
