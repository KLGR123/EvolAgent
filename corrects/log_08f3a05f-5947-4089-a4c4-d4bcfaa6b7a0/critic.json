  "reason": "Task analysis: Find the smallest n where Newton's Method produces x_n = x_{n+1} when both values are rounded to four decimal places, using f(x) = x³ + 4x² - 3x + 8 and x₀ = -5. All three members correctly implemented Newton's Method with proper derivative f'(x) = 3x² + 8x - 3 and iterative formula x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n). Cross-analysis reveals: Members 1 and 2 both concluded n = 2, finding that x₂ and x₃ both round to -4.9361 when expressed to four decimal places. Member 3 concluded n = 3, but this appears to be a misinterpretation - they found the same convergence point but incorrectly identified it as n = 3 instead of n = 2. Convergence assessment: Strong agreement between Members 1 and 2 on both methodology and result. All members calculated identical iteration values: x₁ ≈ -4.9375, x₂ ≈ -4.9361054, x₃ ≈ -4.9361048. Divergence resolution: Member 3's error stems from indexing confusion rather than computational mistakes. When x₂ and x₃ both round to -4.9361, the convergence criterion 'x_n = x_{n+1}' is satisfied at n = 2 (where x₂ = x₃ after rounding). Verification: Independent calculation confirms x₂ = -4.936105444... and x₃ = -4.936104757... both round to -4.9361 at four decimal places. Final validation: n = 2 represents the smallest iteration number where consecutive Newton's Method values become identical when rounded to four decimal places.",
