## Plan Content
```
Search for Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day archive or specific entry from June 27, 2022. Use web search with targeted queries such as 'Merriam-Webster Word of the Day June 27 2022', 'site:merriam-webster.com word of the day June 2022', and 'Merriam-Webster WOTD archive 06/27/2022'. Look for the official Merriam-Webster page showing the word selection, definition, etymology, and any quoted usage examples. Extract the complete entry including the featured word, writer attribution, and quote context to identify which author is referenced in the daily feature.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate the specific Word of the Day entry from a historical date, (2) No previous search attempts exist in the history, (3) Expected outcome is to find the Merriam-Webster archive page with the June 27, 2022 entry, (4) This directly targets the core TASK of identifying the quoted writer from that specific date

    "description": "This implementation executes a comprehensive search strategy to find Merriam-Webster's Word of the Day from June 27, 2022. The approach includes: (1) Multiple targeted Google search queries using various date formats and site-specific searches to maximize coverage, (2) Systematic processing of search results with priority given to official Merriam-Webster domain results, (3) Automatic content retrieval from the most promising official link found, (4) Quick content analysis to verify the presence of date references, WOTD content, and author citations, (5) Complete HTML content preservation in the workspace directory for detailed parsing. The code includes comprehensive error handling, progress reporting through detailed print statements, and saves both search results and page content for subsequent analysis. This establishes the foundation for extracting the specific word, definition, and author reference from the June 27, 2022 entry.",

    "description": 'This implementation performs comprehensive extraction of the Merriam-Webster Word of the Day entry from June 27, 2022. The approach includes: (1) Systematic parsing of the downloaded HTML content using BeautifulSoup to extract key elements like the featured word, date, definition, and etymology, (2) Multiple pattern-matching strategies to identify author references and quoted usage examples using regex patterns for common citation formats, (3) Analysis of potential example sections and quoted content that might contain author attributions, (4) Compilation of all discovered author mentions with their surrounding context for verification, (5) Comprehensive data structure creation containing all extracted information for further analysis. The code includes extensive print statements showing the extraction progress, found authors, and quote contexts. This systematic approach ensures we capture any author references present in the Word of the Day entry, whether in quoted examples, citations, or other attribution formats.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully parsed the Merriam-Webster HTML file, extracting comprehensive Word of the Day information. The script correctly identified 'Jingoism' as the featured word for June 27, 2022, along with its definition ('extreme patriotism or nationalism') and etymology details. Most importantly, the code successfully found the author reference sought in the **PLAN**: Annie Levin from The New York Observer (March 7, 2022) with the quote 'War is bad for culture. Not least of all because it turns our cultural institutions into bastions of jingoism.' The analysis also identified additional authors (Lewis Carroll, John Tenniel) but Annie Levin appears to be the primary contemporary author quoted in the daily feature. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all objectives have been met including finding the featured word, definition, etymology, and author attribution. The detailed analysis has been saved to 'workspace/wotd_detailed_analysis.json' for future reference. No further development is needed as the complete WOTD entry with author reference has been successfully extracted.",
