  "final_answer": "Annie Levin",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the specific writer quoted by Merriam-Webster for their Word of the Day feature on June 27, 2022. This requires accessing historical archives and extracting attribution information from the official entry. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted extensive research and correctly identified the word as 'jingoism' with comprehensive etymology and definitions, but concluded no specific writer was quoted, focusing only on the historical British music hall song lyrics without identifying the contemporary quotation. Member 2 used targeted HTML parsing with specific selectors to extract 'Annie Levin' directly from the quote attribution element, demonstrating precise technical execution and arriving at the correct answer efficiently. Member 3 performed thorough web scraping and HTML analysis, successfully extracting the complete Word of the Day entry including Annie Levin's quote: 'War is bad for culture. Not least of all because it turns our cultural institutions into bastions of jingoism' from The New York Observer, March 7, 2022. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 2 and 3 on 'Annie Levin' as the quoted writer, while Member 1 missed the contemporary quotation section. Divergence resolution: Member 1's error stems from incomplete content extraction, focusing on historical etymology rather than the complete entry including modern usage examples. Synthesis evaluation: Members 2 and 3 both correctly identified Annie Levin through different but valid technical approaches - Member 2 used targeted parsing while Member 3 employed comprehensive extraction. Integration validation: Multiple independent confirmations and detailed quote context ('War is bad for culture...') support Annie Levin as the definitively correct answer.",
