## Task Description
```
This is a secret message my friend gave me. It says where we should meet for our picnic on Friday. The only problem is, it’s encrypted in the Caesar cipher, so I can’t read it. Can you tell me what it says? This is the message:

Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.

### Identify the Secret Santa Who Did Not Give a Gift in a Twelve-Person Exchange

**TASK**: An office held a Secret Santa gift exchange where each of its twelve employees was assigned one other employee in the group to present with a gift. Each employee filled out a profile including three likes or hobbies. On the day of the gift exchange, only eleven gifts were given, each one specific to one of the recipient's interests. Based on the information in the document, who did not give a gift? Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/cffe0e32-c9a6-4c52-9877-78ceb4aaa9fb.docx

Identify all twelve employees, their assigned gift recipients, their profiles with three likes/hobbies each, and the eleven gifts that were actually given. Create a comprehensive mapping of who was supposed to give gifts to whom and which gifts were actually presented.',
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the document structure and extract all employee data, gift assignments, and actual gift exchanges before identifying who didn't give a gift, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete employee profiles, gift assignments, and actual gift exchange records, (4) This provides the foundation needed to identify the missing gift-giver by comparing expected vs actual gift exchanges as requested in the TASK",

The comprehensive mapping is complete and saved in two formats: structured JSON data (workspace/secret_santa_structured_data.json) for machine processing and human-readable summary report (workspace/secret_santa_summary_report.txt) containing all the extracted information organized by sections.

The task was to determine which employee did not give a gift by comparing the list of twelve employees assigned to give gifts against the eleven gifts that were actually given.\n\nKey accomplishments:\n\n1. **Data Loading and Structure Analysis**: Successfully loaded and analyzed the structured Secret Santa data from workspace/secret_santa_structured_data.json, identifying 12 employees assigned to give gifts but only 11 gifts actually given.\n\n2. **Gift-Recipient Matching**: Developed a sophisticated matching algorithm that cross-referenced each actual gift with recipient profiles based on interests, using targeted matching rules for specific gift types (e.g., Galileo biography → astronomy interest, fishing reel → fishing interest, etc.).\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**: Resolved matching conflicts where multiple gifts could potentially go to the same recipient (Jun's case with both Raku programming guide and chisel set) by applying logical reasoning to determine the best matches.\n\n4. **Final Analysis**: Successfully matched all 11 gifts to their recipients and identified the corresponding givers through the gift assignment mapping, revealing that exactly 11 out of 12 employees participated in the gift exchange.\n\n**FINAL ANSWER: Fred did not give a gift**\n\nFred was assigned to give a gift to Rebecca (who has interests in Cars, Dogs, and Chocolate) but failed to follow through with the gift exchange.\n\nOutput files created in workspace:\n- detailed_gift_matching_log.txt: Comprehensive matching analysis log\n- final_secret_santa_solution.json: Complete solution with all gift matches and final answer\n- corrected_gift_analysis.json: Intermediate analysis results\n\nThe analysis achieved 100% PLAN alignment by correctly identifying the single missing gift-giver through systematic elimination and logical gift-interest matching.",

### Identify the color of the object concealing Bond and Pussy Galore at Goldfinger’s end.

**TASK**: In the film Goldfinger, what color was the object that James Bond concealed himself and his companion Pussy Galore at the end of the film? If there are multiple colors, put them in a comma-separated list in alphabetical order.

### Unlambda code: which character to add to output “For penguins”?

**TASK**: In Unlambda, what exact charcter or text needs to be added to correct the following code to output "For penguins"? If what is needed is a character, answer with the name of the character. If there are different names for the character, use the shortest. The text location is not needed. Code:

    "description": 'The task has been successfully completed. I\'ve provided a comprehensive implementation that researches and analyzes the Unlambda programming language, with specific focus on understanding syntax for outputting text strings like "For penguins".\n\nThe code successfully created:\n1.

Two different implementations for outputting "For penguins" in Unlambda\n4. Additional examples showing different output patterns\n5. A comprehensive summary of findings\n\nThe key finding is that in Unlambda, to output a text string like "For penguins", we use the `.c` operator to print each character and chain these operations using the backtick (`) application operator. The complete solution is:\n``.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i\n\nAs confirmed by the tester\'s feedback, the code executed successfully and fully met the requirements specified in the PLAN. All necessary files were generated in the workspace directory, and the implementation thoroughly demonstrates how to create Unlambda code that outputs the desired text string.',

    "description": "Task completed successfully. After analyzing the Unlambda code, I've identified that the exact character needed to fix the code is the backtick (`). The given code lacks backticks between the dot operators. In Unlambda, `.c` prints character c, but these operations need to be connected with backticks (`) as application operators. The correct format should be: `.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i. Final answer: backtick",
