**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

## Plan Content
```
Calculate the total time required for Eliud Kipchoge to run the Earth-Moon minimum perigee distance of 356,400 km at his world record pace of 20.897 km/h. Convert the result to thousand hours, round to the nearest 1000 hours, and format without comma separators as specified in the TASK.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the final calculation step because: (1) We have both required data points - Kipchoge's pace (20.897 km/h) and minimum perigee distance (356,400 km), (2) Previous steps successfully extracted the official world record pace and Wikipedia's minimum perigee value, (3) Expected outcome is the final answer showing time in thousand hours rounded to nearest 1000, (4) This completes the TASK by applying the distance/speed formula and converting to the requested format

### Development Step 6: Determining Hamiltonian Cycle in Earl‚Äôs 49 Green Plot Adjacency Graph

**Description**: Solve the Hamiltonian path problem to determine if Earl can walk through every plot he owns exactly once and return to his starting plot without backtracking. Using the identified 49 green plots from the previous analysis, construct a graph where each plot is a node and edges connect adjacent plots (horizontally and vertically neighboring cells). Apply graph theory algorithms to check if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in Earl's connected land area, considering movement constraints between adjacent plots only.

**Use Cases**:
- Precision agriculture drone surveying: find a Hamiltonian cycle across 49 crop plots so the drone flies over each field section exactly once and returns to the launch pad without retracing any paths
- Warehouse robot inspection routing: compute a cycle through all storage bay locations in a fulfillment center so the robot checks every rack exactly once before returning to its charging dock
- Campus security patrol planning: design a walking route that visits every checkpoint across the university grounds exactly once and loops back to the security office
- Museum maintenance scheduling: generate a path for staff to service each exhibit room once and finish back in the maintenance hub without revisiting corridors
- Printed circuit board testing sequence: determine a probe path that touches each test pad on the PCB exactly once and returns to the starting pad for automated quality control
- Tourist city walking tour creation: plan a route that guides visitors through all 49 landmark sites in a historic district one time and loops back to the tour start point
- Autonomous vacuum cleaner mapping: chart a cleaning path that covers every floor tile in a smart home layout exactly once and ends back at the charging station

### Development Step 19: Sort birth cities from presidential_birthplaces.json records with minimum and maximum longitudes

**Description**: Identify the records in workspace/presidential_birthplaces.json with the minimum longitude and the maximum longitude, extract their birth_city values, sort those two city names alphabetically, and output them as a comma-separated list.

**Use Cases**:
- Identifying the westernmost and easternmost presidential birth cities to generate an interactive U.S. history road-trip planner featuring state travel tips
- Automating quality assurance in a government GIS dataset by flagging records with extreme longitude values for manual verification
- Powering an educational app module that quizzes students on the geography of presidential birthplaces by highlighting the two farthest apart cities
- Generating a dynamic map overlay for a political news website that marks the easternmost and westernmost birth locations of U.S. presidents
- Enriching a travel blog‚Äôs ‚ÄúPresidential Routes‚Äù section by automatically extracting and alphabetically sorting the extreme-longitude birth cities
- Supporting a demographic research project that analyzes geographic dispersion of presidential birthplaces by isolating boundary cases
- Integrating into a civic-education chatbot to quickly answer ‚ÄúWhich president was born farthest west or east?‚Äù by fetching and sorting birth city names

### Development Step 3: Check Hamiltonian Cycle in Earl‚Äôs 49-Plot Adjacency Graph

**Description**: Solve the Hamiltonian path problem to determine if Earl can walk through every plot he owns exactly once and return to his starting plot without backtracking. Using the identified 49 green plots from the previous analysis, construct a graph where each plot is a node and edges connect adjacent plots (horizontally and vertically neighboring cells). Apply graph theory algorithms to check if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in Earl's connected land area, considering movement constraints between adjacent plots only.

**Use Cases**:
- Precision agriculture drone routing: plan a drone‚Äôs flight over 49 designated crop plots (geofenced grid cells) to apply fertilizer exactly once per plot and return to the charging station, optimizing battery life by only moving between adjacent GPS waypoints.
- Autonomous warehouse robot navigation: compute a guided vehicle‚Äôs path through every assigned storage bay in a racked warehouse (modeled as a grid) exactly once, looping back to its docking bay without retracing aisles.
- Smart city waste collection: design a garbage truck route across contiguous urban blocks (each block as a grid plot), ensuring each block is serviced exactly once before returning to the depot, under street‚Äêadjacency constraints.
- Data center maintenance scheduling: generate a technician‚Äôs walkway through every server rack location laid out on a grid floor plan, visiting each rack exactly once and returning to the entrance without backtracking corridors.
- Facility security patrol planning: create a continuous patrol route that covers each security checkpoint on a building‚Äôs floor grid exactly once, then returns to the security office, respecting doorway adjacencies and minimizing redundant passage.
- PCB inspection automation: program a pick‚Äêand‚Äêplace machine to traverse all test points on a printed circuit board (represented as grid nodes) exactly once, then return to the home position, optimizing head movement between adjacent points.
- Archaeological site survey mapping: plan a field surveyor‚Äôs walking route through each excavation cell in a gridded dig site exactly once, returning to the base camp while moving only between adjacent, safe-to-traverse cells.

### Development Step 1: Parse File Road Layout, Locate Houses, Mile Markers, Define Coordinates, Compute House-Tower Distances

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached file data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt to understand the road layout, identify all house positions, and map their locations relative to mile markers. Extract the visual representation showing dashes (-) as mile markers and H symbols as houses, then determine the coordinate system and calculate distances between houses and potential tower locations.

**Use Cases**:
- Rural broadband deployment planning: parse the ASCII road layout to extract house locations by mile marker, then calculate optimal fiber cable routes to bring high-speed internet to each home.
- Emergency medical services optimization: analyze the distances between mapped house positions and candidate ambulance station sites to determine the fastest response coverage along a remote highway.
- Postal delivery route automation: ingest the text-based road map to pinpoint rural mailbox locations, then compute the shortest delivery loop for mail carriers using mile-marker coordinates.
- Electric grid maintenance scheduling: map household positions relative to power line inspection crews‚Äô depots to sequence pipeline or line checks by proximity and minimize downtime.
- Mobile network coverage analysis: identify service gaps by measuring distances from village houses to existing cell towers and recommend new tower installations to fill black spots.
- Environmental sensor network design: use the extracted house coordinates along farmland roads to position weather or soil-moisture sensors at optimal intervals for agricultural research.
- Real estate site evaluation: chart the distribution of roadside properties via mile markers to spotlight high-density clusters for targeted development and marketing campaigns.
