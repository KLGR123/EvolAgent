Task analysis: Calculate time for Kipchoge to run Earth-Moon minimum perigee distance at his marathon world record pace, convert to thousand hours, round to nearest 1000 hours without comma separators. All three members executed systematic approaches with high methodological rigor. Member evaluation: (1) Member 1 used Kipchoge's pace of 20.90 km/h, minimum perigee 356,400 km, calculated 17,052.63 hours = 17.05 thousand hours, rounded to 17 thousand hours. (2) Member 2 used identical values (20.90 km/h pace, 356,400 km distance), performed same calculation yielding 17,052.63 hours, converted to 17.053 thousand hours, rounded to 17 thousand hours = 17,000 hours formatted as 17000. (3) Member 3 used slightly more precise pace of 20.897 km/h with same 356,400 km distance, calculated 17,055.08 hours = 17.055080 thousand hours, rounded to 17 thousand hours. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence: all members identified same Wikipedia minimum perigee value (356,400 km), used virtually identical Kipchoge pace calculations (20.90 vs 20.897 km/h), and reached consistent final answer of 17 thousand hours. Divergence analysis: Minor pace variations (0.003 km/h difference) resulted in negligible impact on final rounded result. All members correctly applied Berlin Marathon 2:01:09 world record time. Integration assessment: Member 3 demonstrated highest precision in pace calculation (20.897 km/h vs rounded 20.90 km/h), but all approaches yielded identical final answer after rounding. Validation: Independent verification confirms 356,400 km ÷ 20.9 km/h ≈ 17,052 hours ≈ 17 thousand hours when rounded to nearest 1000. Final answer confidence: very high based on unanimous member agreement and mathematical verification.
