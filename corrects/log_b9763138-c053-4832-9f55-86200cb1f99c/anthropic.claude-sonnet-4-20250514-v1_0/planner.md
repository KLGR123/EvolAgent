### Compute odds of today’s Sunset Picnic Trip using a steam locomotive

**TASK**: The attached file lists the locomotives owned by a local railroad museum. It gives each locomotive’s identifying number, operating status, and the name of the daily excursion it heads, if operational. What are the odds that today’s Sunset Picnic Trip will use a steam locomotive? Assume that each day’s excursion picks one of its assigned locomotives at random, and express the answer in the form “1 in 4”, “1 in 5”, etc. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/4d0aa727-86b1-406b-9b33-f870dd14a4a5.xlsx

The Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/4d0aa727-86b1-406b-9b33-f870dd14a4a5.xlsx was parsed and analyzed to extract locomotive data including identification numbers, operating status, and daily excursion assignments. All locomotives assigned to the 'Sunset Picnic Trip' were successfully identified: locomotive #1060 (steam, 0-4-0 wheel configuration), locomotive #93 (diesel, NW2), and locomotive #57 (diesel, GP30). The locomotive types were correctly classified using wheel configuration patterns for steam locomotives and model designations for diesel locomotives. The probability analysis was completed showing 1 steam locomotive versus 2 diesel locomotives on the Sunset Picnic Trip, resulting in 33.3% probability for steam, 66.7% probability for diesel, with odds ratio of 1:2 (steam:diesel). Complete results including locomotive details, classification logic, and probability calculations were saved to workspace/sunset_picnic_locomotive_analysis.json. The tester confirmed execution was successful and all **PLAN** objectives were achieved with no further development needed.",

Any other value (-100 to 100, excluding 0) causes an `UhOh` exception and retry.\n\n**FINAL NUMERIC OUTPUT: 0**\n\nThe program will always output `0` because:\n- The retry loop continues indefinitely until `Yeah()` returns `True`\n- `Yeah()` only returns `True` when `self.value == 0`\n- When this condition is met, `keep_trying()` returns `maybe.value` (which is 0)\n- The main execution prints this returned value\n\nThe randomness in `randint(-100, 100)` only affects how many iterations it takes to find a 0, but the final output is deterministic: it will always be 0. The program essentially implements a probabilistic search for the value 0 among random integers, and once found, that's the value it outputs.\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `workspace/target_python_code.py`: Complete copy of the analyzed code\n- `workspace/code_execution_analysis.txt`: Detailed analysis documentation\n\n**Task Status**: COMPLETE - Successfully parsed the Python code, traced its execution logic, and determined the final numeric output is 0.",
