## Plan Content
```
Search for NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) archive from the first week of August 2015 (August 1-7, 2015). Look for entries that show city lights on the horizon and identify which specific city is featured. Use search approaches such as: (1) Direct access to NASA APOD archive at apod.nasa.gov for August 2015, (2) Search terms like 'NASA APOD August 2015 city lights horizon', (3) Browse the daily entries from August 1-7, 2015 to find images showing urban illumination. Extract the complete APOD entry including the image, title, explanation text, and any city identification mentioned in the description.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific NASA APOD from the first week of August 2015 that shows city lights, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the APOD entry and identify which city is featured on the horizon, (4) This establishes the foundation for the subsequent steps of finding the namesake's Chicago landmark and architectural firm

This code: (1) Performs web searches using multiple targeted queries to find relevant APOD archive content, (2) Attempts direct access to NASA's APOD main archive page, (3) Systematically accesses individual APOD pages for each day in the target week using the standard NASA APOD URL format (apYYMMDD.html), (4) Extracts and analyzes each APOD entry including title, explanation text, and image URL, (5) Identifies potential matches by searching for city-related keywords like 'city', 'lights', 'horizon', 'urban', etc. in the content, (6) Saves all retrieved APOD pages as HTML files in workspace/ for detailed analysis, (7) Creates a comprehensive analysis summary with all entries and highlights those with city-related content. The approach combines both search-based discovery and systematic date-based access to ensure complete coverage of the target week. Files created include individual APOD HTML pages and JSON summaries for further processing.",
