## Task Description
```
I have the Standard plan in the image below, and I just uploaded 60 equally sized files and got a message that I'm 100GB over the limit. I have 980 more files of the same size to upload. What is the average additional cost per file in dollar that goes over my current plan limit rounded to the nearest cent if I have to upgrade to the minimum possible plan to store them all? Answer with the following format: x.xx Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/d8152ad6-e4d5-4c12-8bb7-8d57dc10c6de.png

This plan provides 50TB (51,200GB) of storage, which is sufficient for the projected 37,232GB total storage requirement.\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `workspace/plan_image_analysis.txt`: Complete GPT-4o analysis of the image\n- `workspace/storage_plan_calculation.json`: Detailed calculations and plan comparisons\n\nThe analysis successfully identified that while the Plus plan ($19.99/month) would solve the current 100GB overage issue, the projected storage needs for all 1040 files require the Premium plan to avoid future overage problems.
