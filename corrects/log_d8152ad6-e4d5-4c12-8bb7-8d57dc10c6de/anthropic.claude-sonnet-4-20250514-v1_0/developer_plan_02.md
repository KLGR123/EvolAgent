# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** d8152ad6-e4d5-4c12-8bb7-8d57dc10c6de  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-31 20:01:39

## Plan Content
```
Calculate the file size and determine the minimum plan upgrade needed. Based on the extracted pricing information: (1) Calculate individual file size using the fact that 60 files caused 100GB overage, (2) Calculate total storage needed for all 1040 files (60 uploaded + 980 remaining), (3) Determine which plan (Plus at 10TB or Premium at 50TB) is the minimum required to store all files, (4) Calculate the additional monthly cost compared to the current Standard plan, (5) Divide the additional monthly cost by the number of files that exceed the Standard plan limit to get the average additional cost per file, (6) Round to the nearest cent and format as x.xx.
```

## Plan Description
```
This calculation step is necessary because: (1) We have the pricing structure from the image analysis but need to perform the mathematical calculations to determine costs, (2) Previous analysis extracted the plan details but didn't calculate the specific cost per file scenario, (3) Expected outcome is the precise additional cost per file rounded to nearest cent in the required x.xx format, (4) This directly answers the TASK question about average additional cost per file for the overage scenario

### Development Step 2: Extract and Analyze Fast-Food Chain Sales by City from Excel; Compare Wharvton vs Algrimand Totals

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/7cc4acfa-63fd-4acc-a1a1-e8e529e0a97f.xlsx to extract all sales data for the regional fast-food chain menu items by city location. Identify the data structure including column headers and city organization, then calculate the total sales for Wharvton and Algrimand specifically to determine which city had greater total sales.

**Use Cases**:
- Retail chain monthly revenue auditing for two flagship outlets using Excel-driven sales extraction and automated JSON reporting to optimize local marketing spend
- Food delivery platform comparing average order values across two metropolitan zones by parsing order logs in spreadsheets and generating side-by-side sales breakdowns
- Pharmaceutical distributor analyzing prescription volume and revenue in two regional pharmacies via automated Excel parsing to identify stock-replenishment priorities
- University campus dining services comparing meal-plan purchases between North and South campuses by extracting menu-item sales from spreadsheets to balance kitchen staffing
- Vehicle rental operator assessing daily rental income and fleet utilization at two city depots through Excel data analysis and programmatic sales comparison for asset reallocation
- Non-profit organization evaluating donation totals from two signature fundraising galas by parsing contribution spreadsheets and exporting summary insights for donor relations
- E-commerce fulfillment team comparing product sales velocities in two regional warehouses via automated spreadsheet ingestion and JSON summary reports to streamline restocking
- Sports franchise analyzing merchandise and concession revenue at home vs. away stadiums by extracting itemized sales from Excel files and programmatically determining lead location

### Development Step 1: Parse Excel file to compute vendor revenue-to-rent ratios and identify lowest-ratio vendor type

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/076c8171-9b3b-49b9-a477-244d2a532826.xlsx to extract vendor data including monthly revenue, rent payments, and type information. Calculate the revenue-to-rent ratio for each vendor to identify which vendor makes the least money relative to their rent payments, then extract the corresponding type value for that vendor.

**Use Cases**:
- Food court operator monitoring monthly vendor sales versus stall rent to optimize vendor mix and renegotiate lease terms for low-performing food stalls
- Shopping mall management automating extraction of tenant revenue and rent ratios to identify underperforming retailers and adjust lease incentives
- Commercial property manager generating monthly financial health dashboards that compute each vendorâ€™s income-to-rent ratio and categorize vendor type for investor reports
- Trade show organizer evaluating exhibitor booth sales relative to booth rental fees to set tiered pricing and allocate premium versus standard booth types
- Retail analytics consultancy delivering automated reports on outlet mall tenant profitability by analyzing rent burden and sales data across different store categories
- Startup incubator assessing kiosk operator performance by calculating revenue-to-rent ratios and vendor types to allocate shared resources and mentorship support
- City economic development office analyzing street vendor earnings against permit fees to design targeted subsidy programs for low-income entrepreneurs
- Academic researcher studying urban marketplace dynamics by correlating vendor types with rent burdens and monthly revenues to inform small business policy recommendations

### Development Step 3: Find Vendor with Lowest Revenue-to-Rent Ratio and Extract Their Type from Excel Data

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/076c8171-9b3b-49b9-a477-244d2a532826.xlsx to extract vendor data including monthly revenue, rent payments, and type information. Calculate the revenue-to-rent ratio for each vendor to identify which vendor makes the least money relative to their rent payments, then extract the corresponding type value for that vendor.

**Use Cases**:
- Retail property management teams monitoring monthly vendor performance to identify underperforming tenants with low revenue-to-rent ratios and proactively renegotiate lease terms
- Municipal market administrators allocating vendor subsidies in public marketplaces by analyzing which stallholders generate the least revenue relative to their rent obligations
- Commercial real estate portfolio managers generating quarterly reports to compare revenue-to-rent ratios across shopping centers and optimize space utilization
