## Final Answer
```
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify which of the six logical biconditional statements is not logically equivalent to the others by evaluating the truth values of both sides of each biconditional. All three members independently identified the same statement as non-equivalent through systematic logical analysis. Member 1 evaluation: Demonstrated comprehensive methodology using truth tables for all combinations (TT, TF, FT, FF), correctly identifying that statement 5 produces different truth values on both sides of the biconditional for specific combinations when A=False and B=True, and when A=False and B=False. Showed strong analytical rigor with detailed verification process. Member 2 evaluation: Provided concise but accurate analysis, correctly identifying that ¬A → B is equivalent to (A ∨ B), not (A ∨ ¬B), demonstrating solid understanding of logical equivalence rules. While brief, the reasoning is sound and correct. Member 3 evaluation: Used systematic approach with truth tables, properly applying established logical laws including De Morgan's Laws, Contrapositive rule, and Implication equivalences. Confirmed the same result through comprehensive verification. Convergence analysis: All three members reached identical conclusions through different but valid analytical approaches, providing high confidence in the result. Cross-verification confirms that statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are valid logical equivalences (De Morgan's Laws, Contrapositive, Implication equivalence, and Negation of implication), while statement 5 fails the equivalence test. Integration validation: The logical equivalence ¬A → B ≡ (A ∨ B) contradicts the claimed equivalence to (A ∨ ¬B), confirming this as the non-equivalent statement.
