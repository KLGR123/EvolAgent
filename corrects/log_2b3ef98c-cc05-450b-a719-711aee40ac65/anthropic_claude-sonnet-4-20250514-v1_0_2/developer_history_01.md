This code loads the specified MP3 file, extracts metadata, converts it to the proper format for speech recognition, and transcribes the spoken content using Google Speech Recognition. It then analyzes the transcription for anagram-related keywords, potential text to rearrange, and specific instructions from the professor. The analysis results are saved to multiple workspace files including the raw transcription, detailed JSON analysis, and a summary file. This is the first step in identifying what text needs to be rearranged into an anagram according to the professor's spoken instructions.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully transcribed the audio file. The transcription reveals that the professor is asking students to find the original Shakespeare line that is an anagram of: 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten'. However, the automatic text extraction incorrectly identified shorter fragments as the anagram text. The actual anagram to solve is the long phrase at the end of the transcription. **PLAN** alignment: 90% complete - audio was processed and transcribed successfully, and the anagram challenge is clearly identified. The code saved useful files to workspace for reference. Next step: The actual anagram text that needs to be rearranged is 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten' - this should be rearranged to find the famous Shakespeare line.",
