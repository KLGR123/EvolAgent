  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify countries with gross savings >35% of GDP for every year 2001-2010 using World Bank data, formatted as alphabetical comma-separated list. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 used indicator NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS (gross national savings) with proper API methodology, filtering for complete data and excluding regional aggregates, reaching 4 countries: Brunei, China, Morocco, Singapore. Member 2 used indicator NY.GDS.TOTL.ZS (gross domestic savings) yielding 14 countries including Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, etc. Member 3 used NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS matching Member 1's approach and results. Cross-analysis reveals critical divergence: Members 1&3 used gross national savings (NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS) while Member 2 used gross domestic savings (NY.GDS.TOTL.ZS). Convergence validation: Members 1&3 achieved identical results through independent analysis using same indicator. Contradiction resolution: The task specifies 'gross savings' without domestic/national distinction, but World Bank's primary gross savings indicator is NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS (gross national savings), which is the standard measure for international comparisons. Member 2's domestic savings indicator captures different economic concept. Synthesis evaluation: Members 1&3 demonstrate superior methodological alignment with World Bank's standard gross savings definition, rigorous data filtering, and consistent results. Integration confidence: High - dual independent verification using authoritative indicator confirms 4-country result.",
