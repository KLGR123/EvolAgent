## Final Answer
```
34689
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the fish species from Finding Nemo that became invasive through pet trade releases, then locate USGS documentation of nonnative occurrences with specific ZIP codes before 2020. All three members correctly identified the main character as clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris) and successfully accessed the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Database. However, critical differences emerged in their location analysis and ZIP code extraction. Member 0 found one USGS record (Specimen ID: 1468741) from 2018 at Fred Howard Park, Pinellas County, Florida, and identified three ZIP codes (34689, 34690, 34691) covering that specific area. Member 1 found the same USGS record and location but used geocoding to determine the precise ZIP code as 34689 for Fred Howard Park. Member 2 found Florida records from 2018 in the Crystal-Pithlachascotee area and extracted five ZIP codes (34428, 34429, 34652, 34655, 34667). Cross-analysis reveals convergence on the core finding: clownfish documented as nonnative in Florida in 2018. However, divergence exists in location specificity and ZIP code determination. Critical evaluation shows Member 1 demonstrated superior methodological rigor by: (1) identifying the exact same USGS specimen record as Member 0, (2) using precise geocoding to determine the specific ZIP code for the documented location, (3) providing the most accurate geographic specificity with coordinates, and (4) focusing on the single verified USGS record rather than expanding to potentially unrelated areas. Member 2's Crystal-Pithlachascotee area appears to be a different or broader geographic interpretation that may not correspond to the specific USGS specimen location. Final validation: Member 1's approach provides the most precise and verifiable answer based on the specific USGS documented occurrence.
