## Final Answer
```
2012
```

## True Answer
```
2012
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify a baseball player based on four specific criteria - unusual walk style nickname, 29 stolen bases in 1970, traded from Chicago White Sox in 1971 for Tommy McCraw - then determine his death year. Member 0 (index 1) identified Cesar Tovar with nickname 'Pepito', 30 stolen bases in 1970 (close to 29), but failed to establish any connection to the Chicago White Sox or the 1971 Tommy McCraw trade, which are critical task requirements. The analysis was thorough but focused on the wrong player. Members 1 and 2 (indices 1 and 2) both correctly identified Ed Stroud as the target player, systematically verifying all criteria: nickname 'The Creeper' for unusual walk style, exactly 29 stolen bases in 1970 season, and the specific March 29, 1971 trade where Chicago White Sox traded Ed Stroud to Washington Senators in exchange for Tommy McCraw. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on player identification, trade details, and death verification. Both members conducted comprehensive searches across multiple authoritative sources (Wikipedia, Baseball Reference, MLB.com, Baseball Almanac, SABR) and consistently found Ed Stroud died July 2, 2012 in Cleveland, Ohio at age 72. Divergence analysis: Member 0's focus on Cesar Tovar represents a fundamental misidentification, lacking any evidence of White Sox connection or McCraw trade involvement. Synthesis evaluation: Members 1 and 2 demonstrate superior research methodology, complete criteria verification, and consistent death date confirmation across multiple independent sources. Final validation: Ed Stroud definitively meets all task criteria with death year 2012 confirmed by extensive source verification. Confidence level: Very High.
