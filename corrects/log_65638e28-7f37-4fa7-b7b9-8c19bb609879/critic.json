  "final_answer": "Kleinpaul",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the author who influenced the neurologist's belief in 'endopsychic myths' according to chapter 2 of the book with DOI 10.1353/book.24372, requiring last name only. All three members successfully identified the book as 'A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt' by Herman Westerink, with Sigmund Freud as the subject neurologist. Member 1 evaluation: Conducted thorough systematic research, successfully downloaded the complete 2MB PDF from Project MUSE, extracted all 333 pages, located the specific passage in chapter 2, and provided direct textual evidence identifying Rudolf Kleinpaul through his 1898 book 'Die Lebendigen und die Toten in Volksglauben, Religion und Sage'. Demonstrated exceptional methodological rigor with comprehensive documentation. Member 2 evaluation: Initially identified the correct book but provided incorrect answer 'Feuerbach' instead of Kleinpaul, indicating either incomplete research or confusion between different theoretical influences on Freud. While the approach was systematic, the final result was factually incorrect. Member 3 evaluation: Conducted comprehensive bibliographic research, successfully accessed the full book content, performed systematic searches, and correctly identified Rudolf Kleinpaul with supporting textual evidence. Demonstrated strong research methodology and accurate execution. Convergence analysis: Members 1 and 3 reached identical conclusion (Kleinpaul) with consistent supporting evidence, while Member 2 diverged with incorrect answer (Feuerbach). Cross-validation of textual evidence from Members 1 and 3 confirms Rudolf Kleinpaul as definitively correct. Resolution: The direct quote 'After studying this book he discovered the existence of endopsychic myths' referring to Kleinpaul's work provides unambiguous evidence. Final validation: Multiple independent confirmations support Kleinpaul as the correct answer, with Member 1 providing the most comprehensive analysis and documentation.",
