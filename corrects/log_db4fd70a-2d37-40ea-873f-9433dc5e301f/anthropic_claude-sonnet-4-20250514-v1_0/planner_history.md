    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate official MBTA documentation showing the Franklin-Foxboro line stations as they existed in May 2023, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this transit route, (3) Expected outcome is to find the complete station sequence and identify which stops fall between South Station and Windsor Gardens, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement to count intermediate stops on the MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line during the specified timeframe.',
