### 2011 Publisher of Lithium Salt Calcination and Acidithiobacillus Two-Stage Bioleaching Recovery Process

**TASK**: In 2011, which publisher published a work covering a process that recovers nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals from spent automotive catalysts using calcination with lithium salts, and detailing a two-stage bioleaching method employing Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans targeting low-grade cobalt ores?

Davenport). The search executed 10 targeted queries and analyzed 150 results, successfully identifying: (1) 4 publications specifically mentioning 2011, (2) 4 results covering calcination with lithium salts for metal recovery, (3) 13 results on bioleaching using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, and (4) multiple references to two-stage bioleaching techniques for low-grade cobalt ores. The identified 2011 Elsevier book comprehensively covers all specified processes including calcination with lithium salts, bioleaching methods using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, two-stage bioleaching for cobalt ore processing, and hydrometallurgical recovery from spent automotive catalysts. All search results and analysis have been saved to workspace files: 'workspace/hydrometallurgical_2011_search_results_20250730_194840.json' and 'workspace/hydrometallurgical_2011_analysis_summary.json'.

### Identify weight and adjacent-column swap causing checksum errors in modified ISBN-13 numbers

**TASK**: The following numbers function similarly to ISBN 13 numbers, however, their validation methods are slightly different. Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.
