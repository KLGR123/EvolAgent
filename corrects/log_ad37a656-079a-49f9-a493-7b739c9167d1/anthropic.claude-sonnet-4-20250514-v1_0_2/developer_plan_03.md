# Developer Plan #3 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** ad37a656-079a-49f9-a493-7b739c9167d1  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 3  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-31 19:34:21

## Plan Content
```
Search for US nuclear tests that had a yield of 15 megatons to match the Tunguska event's explosive force found in Encyclopedia Britannica. Use targeted searches such as 'US nuclear test 15 megaton yield', 'American nuclear weapons test 15 megatons TNT equivalent', and 'United States atomic bomb test 15 MT yield'. Look for official nuclear test databases, historical records, or authoritative sources that list US nuclear tests with their respective yields. Identify the specific test name that matches the 15 megaton measurement and extract the complete name so we can determine the last word.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have confirmed the Tunguska explosive force as 15 megatons from Encyclopedia Britannica, (2) The TASK requires finding the US nuclear test with the same yield and extracting the last word of its name, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific US nuclear test with 15 megaton yield, (4) This will complete the TASK by providing the final answer - the last word of the matching nuclear test name

### Development Step 4: Compile All Post-1977 Malko Competition Winners with Nationalities, Including Defunct Countries

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Archiving and trend analysis for music historians mapping post-1977 Malko Competition winners by nationality and geopolitical context
- Classical music database enrichment with automated extraction of winner names, years, and historical country tags for digital library platforms
- Academic research into Cold War–era cultural exchanges, using detailed Malko Competition data for musicology theses on geopolitical influences
- Museum exhibition curation displaying Malko Competition laureates from defunct states (USSR, Yugoslavia, etc.) to illustrate 20th-century political shifts
- Government cultural policy evaluation assessing how nation-state transformations impacted participation and success rates in international music contests
- University course material development, creating interactive timelines of Malko Competition winners tied to historical country changes for world history or music studies
- Record label marketing analytics identifying award-winning artists’ regional origins and historical backgrounds to drive targeted promotional campaigns

### Development Step 3: Identify BFC Dynamo’s 16 August 1986 Opening Match Venue at Berlin Sports Complex and Attendance

**Description**: Search for information about BFC Dynamo's opening match on 16 August 1986, focusing on identifying the specific sports complex in Berlin where it took place and the attendance figures. Search for keywords including 'BFC Dynamo 16 August 1986 opening match', 'Berliner FC Dynamo August 1986 attendance', 'DDR-Oberliga 1986-87 season opening match Berlin', and 'BFC Dynamo home stadium 1986 spectators'. Look for match reports, historical records, or sports databases that document this specific game and the number of spectators who attended at the Berlin sports complex with multiple facilities.

**Use Cases**:
- Automating sports history research by extracting match dates, venues, and attendance figures for a Berlin club’s opening fixtures in academic publications
- Enriching a digital sports archive’s metadata by programmatically retrieving stadium names and crowd numbers for DDR-Oberliga seasons
- Powering a fan engagement dashboard that displays historical attendance trends and venue details for Berliner FC Dynamo’s past campaigns
- Supporting data-driven facility management by aggregating spectator counts to forecast maintenance and staffing needs at large sports complexes
- Enabling investigative journalism teams to fact-check match reports and verify attendance discrepancies in East German football archives
- Feeding a predictive ticket-sales model with historical crowd data and venue capacities to optimize pricing strategies for upcoming games
- Assisting sports marketers in benchmarking competitor attendance and stadium utilization to design targeted promotional campaigns
- Building a mobile trivia app that dynamically pulls historical match information, including the 16 August 1986 opener and its spectator turnout

### Development Step 2: Post-1977 20th-Century Malko Competition Winners and Their Nationalities (Including Defunct States)

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Archiving and extracting grant awardees from a foundation’s online records (2000–2020) to analyze funding trends by recipient nationality
- Aggregating hackathon winner data from multiple tech event websites post-2015 for corporate sponsorship decision support
- Mining patent award information from USPTO HTML archives to map inventor nationalities and identify innovation hotspots
- Automating extraction of sanctioned entities from government PDF/HTML sanction lists to keep compliance databases up to date
- Building a music streaming service feature that compiles historical competition winners and their nationalities for curated playlists
- Parsing academic conference websites to index keynote speakers and their affiliations for university library catalogs
- Extracting sports tournament champions from archived sports federation pages to feed a real-time analytics dashboard for media outlets

This search phase uses 10 targeted queries covering various search angles including official test databases, historical records, and specific yield documentation. The code searches for key indicators like '15 megaton', 'US nuclear test', test names/operations, and authoritative nuclear sources. Results are systematically categorized by relevance score, with special attention to results that explicitly mention 15 megatons and contain test names.

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements comprehensively. The search successfully identified the US nuclear test with 15 megaton yield matching the Tunguska event's explosive force. Through 10 different targeted search queries, the code found 120 total results with 88 results specifically mentioning '15 megaton' and consistently identified 'Castle Bravo' as the US nuclear test with exactly 15 megaton yield. The search results clearly show that Castle Bravo, conducted on March 1, 1954, at Bikini Atoll, had a yield of 15 megatons of TNT equivalent - matching the Tunguska event's estimated explosive force from Encyclopedia Britannica. The **PLAN** objective has been achieved: the specific test name is 'Castle Bravo' and the last word is 'Bravo'. The code also properly saved comprehensive results to JSON format and created analysis summaries. Since the output is quite lengthy (contains detailed search results and analysis), I recommend saving the complete output to 'workspace/castle_bravo_search_results.txt' for future reference and documentation purposes. No further development is needed - the US nuclear test matching 15 megaton Tunguska equivalent has been definitively identified as Castle Bravo.",
