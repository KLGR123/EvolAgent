# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Search the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online for the Spanish word 'caminata' and locate the 1994 example sentence. Extract the source title for that example sentence and then use Google Translate to translate that source title from Spanish to English.

## Description
This is the logical next step because: (1) We have established from the HISTORY that the Latin root 'caminata' shares spelling with the Spanish word 'caminata', (2) The previous research successfully identified the etymology connection, (3) Expected outcome is to find the Collins dictionary entry for 'caminata', locate the 1994 example sentence, identify its source title, and translate it using Google Translate, (4) This directly advances toward completing the TASK by accessing the specific dictionary resource mentioned and obtaining the final translation

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Compile Mercedes Sosa’s Studio Albums 2000–2009 Using 2022 English Wikipedia

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about Mercedes Sosa's discography, specifically focusing on studio albums released between 2000 and 2009 (inclusive). Use the latest 2022 version of English Wikipedia as the primary source. Target these research approaches: (1) Search for Mercedes Sosa's main Wikipedia page to access her complete discography section, (2) Look for dedicated discography pages or album listings that specify release years and album types, (3) Extract detailed information about each album released during the 2000-2009 period, distinguishing between studio albums and other types (live albums, compilations, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all studio albums with their release years for verification and counting.

**Use Cases**:
- Music streaming metadata automation for a music platform, enriching Mercedes Sosa album entries with verified release years and studio album status
- Cultural heritage digital archiving for a national library project, systematically cataloging Mercedes Sosa’s 2000–2009 studio albums in a preservation database
- Academic musicology research analyzing Latin American folk music trends, extracting precise release-year data for quantitative studies
- Fan community website content generation, automating the creation of detailed Mercedes Sosa discography pages with album names and release dates
- Journalism fact-checking workflows in cultural media outlets, verifying studio album release information for articles on Latin American music history
- Data science pipeline development for music industry analytics, building structured datasets of studio albums (2000–2009) to model release frequency and artist productivity
- Mobile app feature integration in a music discovery application, populating an interactive Mercedes Sosa discography timeline with accurate album details
- Record label internal catalog management, cross-referencing archival records with Wikipedia sources to update and reconcile studio album inventories

### Development Step 4: 1977 New York Yankees Walk Totals and At-Bats: Top Walk Leader Identification

**Description**: Search for comprehensive 1977 New York Yankees regular season statistics focusing on individual player walk totals. Target these information sources: (1) Official MLB statistics databases or archives, (2) Baseball-Reference.com historical data for 1977 Yankees roster, (3) Sports statistics websites with detailed seasonal breakdowns, (4) Historical baseball records covering individual player performance metrics. Extract complete batting statistics including walks (BB) and at-bats (AB) for all Yankees players during the 1977 regular season. Identify the player with the highest walk total and record their corresponding at-bat count for verification.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated sports analytics pipeline for a baseball statistics website that scrapes historical MLB table data, filters out summary rows, and ranks players by walk-to-at-bat ratios.
- Fantasy baseball app backend for generating custom leaderboards from Baseball-Reference tables by extracting individual player walk totals and at-bat counts while excluding aggregate team lines.
- Sports journalism workflow that automatically extracts, filters, and verifies player performance metrics from archived HTML tables to power weekly “On This Day in 1977 Yankees History” feature articles.
- Academic research project in sports economics that collects walk and at-bat data across seasons by scraping and cleaning historical baseball tables, ensuring only individual player entries are used for regression analysis.
- Sports betting model development where historical player walk rates and at-bat frequencies are programmatically scraped, cleaned, and ranked to serve as predictive features in machine learning algorithms.
- Museum or exhibit interactive display system that dynamically pulls, filters, and ranks 1977 Yankees player statistics from web archives to create player comparison dashboards for visitors.
- Financial data engineering scenario where quarterly earnings tables from corporate filings are scraped, summary rows excluded, and companies ranked by profit margins for investment analysis.
- Healthcare data aggregation tool that scrapes clinical trial outcome tables, filters out aggregate results, and ranks treatment arms by success rates to assist meta-analysts in systematic reviews.

### Development Step 4: Compile Mercedes Sosa Studio Albums 2000–2009 from 2022 English Wikipedia

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about Mercedes Sosa's discography, specifically focusing on studio albums released between 2000 and 2009 (inclusive). Use the latest 2022 version of English Wikipedia as the primary source. Target these research approaches: (1) Search for Mercedes Sosa's main Wikipedia page to access her complete discography section, (2) Look for dedicated discography pages or album listings that specify release years and album types, (3) Extract detailed information about each album released during the 2000-2009 period, distinguishing between studio albums and other types (live albums, compilations, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all studio albums with their release years for verification and counting.

**Use Cases**:
- Music historians compiling a detailed biography of Mercedes Sosa use the automated studio album extraction to verify release dates for chapters covering her 2000s era
- Record labels planning reissue campaigns leverage the year-by-year breakdown to target promotional budgets for Mercedes Sosa’s studio albums released between 2000 and 2009
- Streaming platform metadata teams perform batch validation of album entries to ensure high-confidence studio album classifications between 2000–2009 match internal catalogs
- Academic researchers studying trends in Latin American folk music use the extracted discography data to run statistical models on studio album production in the early 21st century
- Cultural institutions curating Latin music exhibitions integrate the structured album list into digital archives to create interactive timelines of Sosa’s studio work
- Licensing departments automate royalty calculations by cross-referencing confirmed studio albums from 2000–2009 with internal sales and performance data
- Podcast producers planning anniversary episodes use the precise extraction of album titles and release years to craft accurate episode scripts celebrating Sosa’s studio work
- Music data analysts at streaming services schedule anniversary playlists and marketing campaigns around the most productive years identified in the research output

### Development Step 1: List Mercedes Sosa’s Studio Albums (2000–2009) from 2022 English Wikipedia

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about Mercedes Sosa's discography, specifically focusing on studio albums released between 2000 and 2009 (inclusive). Use the latest 2022 version of English Wikipedia as the primary source. Target these research approaches: (1) Search for Mercedes Sosa's main Wikipedia page to access her complete discography section, (2) Look for dedicated discography pages or album listings that specify release years and album types, (3) Extract detailed information about each album released during the 2000-2009 period, distinguishing between studio albums and other types (live albums, compilations, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all studio albums with their release years for verification and counting.

**Use Cases**:
- Music streaming platform metadata verification and catalog enrichment by automatically extracting Mercedes Sosa’s 2000–2009 studio albums for accurate user-facing album listings
- University musicology department research support for analyzing Latin American folk evolution through systematic extraction of Mercedes Sosa’s early-2000s discography
- Automated content generation for music review blogs that populate album spotlights and release histories of Mercedes Sosa from 2000 to 2009
- Digital archive cataloging workflow for national libraries to import and verify Mercedes Sosa’s studio album details into their cultural heritage databases
- Museum exhibition curation tool that compiles Mercedes Sosa’s 2000s studio albums for interactive displays on Latin American protest music
- Record label analytics dashboard that tracks release frequency and patterns in Mercedes Sosa’s discography to inform marketing strategies
- Voice assistant skill development for smart speakers, enabling users to query Mercedes Sosa’s studio albums released between 2000 and 2009
- Event planning and tribute concert scheduling system that automatically pulls Mercedes Sosa’s album anniversaries from 2000–2009 to coordinate celebration dates
