### Title: Find Longest Word on Boggle Board ABRL EITE IONS FPEI Using words_alpha Dictionary

**TASK**: I thought we could try a fun word puzzle together :)

I've got a Boggle board here:

ABRL
EITE
IONS
FPEI

I'd like to know the longest word that can be generated from the board. Please find the longest English language word that can be generated from this board. If more than one word of the same length exists at the maximum word length, please report the longest word that comes first, alphabetically. Oh, and I know that there might be different wordlists available for Boggle, so let's please just use the words_alpha dictionary found at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words as the dictionary for our game.

```

    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": 'Download the words_alpha dictionary from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words to workspace/words_alpha.txt and then implement a Boggle solver to find all valid words that can be formed from the given 4x4 board (ABRL/EITE/IONS/FPEI) using the downloaded dictionary. The solver should check all possible paths on the board where adjacent cells (including diagonally adjacent) can be visited exactly once per word, then identify the longest valid English word(s) and return the alphabetically first one if there are ties.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal approach because: (1) We need to solve a Boggle puzzle which requires both the specific dictionary and a pathfinding algorithm, (2) No previous work has been done on this task, (3) Expected outcome is to download the required dictionary and implement a complete Boggle solver that finds the longest valid word, (4) This directly addresses the TASK by using the specified word list and board configuration to find the longest possible English word.',

The class-based approach successfully resolved the function scope issues encountered in earlier attempts. The solver correctly implements Boggle rules and produces the expected result. **PLAN** is 100% complete with verified success.",

### Tizin VOS Translation for “I like apples” Using Maktay and Zapple

**TASK**: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.

```
{
    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": '<END>',
    "description": "Task completed successfully through direct linguistic analysis. Based on the Tizin grammar rules provided: (1) Sentence structure is Verb-Object-Subject, (2) 'Maktay' means 'is pleasing to' in present tense, (3) The thing being liked (apples) becomes the subject in nominative form 'Apple', (4) The person doing the liking (I) becomes the object in accusative form 'Mato'. Therefore, 'I like apples' translates to 'Maktay Mato Apple' in Tizin. Final answer: Maktay Mato Apple",
