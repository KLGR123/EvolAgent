  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the birthplace of the author who wrote both 'Francia's Reign of Terror' (third volume documenting four-year stay under Dictator Francia) and a novel published by Saunders and Otley in 1839 with specific characteristics. All three members conducted systematic, multi-phase research with consistent methodology and reached identical conclusions. Member evaluation: (1) Member 1 demonstrated exceptional systematic approach with comprehensive search strategies, proper evidence validation, and meticulous documentation across Wikipedia and Google Books API searches, achieving high confidence through cross-referencing multiple authoritative sources. (2) Member 2 employed thorough DDGS search methodology with detailed relevance scoring systems, comprehensive documentation, and strong evidence compilation, showing excellent analytical rigor in connecting all required elements. (3) Member 3 used effective search strategies with proper verification protocols and comprehensive final documentation, though with some minor technical processing issues that didn't affect final accuracy. Convergence analysis: Perfect agreement across all members on key findings - J.P. Robertson (John Parish Robertson) and W.P. Robertson as authors of 'Francia's Reign of Terror,' 'Solomon Seesaw' as the 1839 Saunders and Otley novel, Hablot Knight Browne (Phiz) as the Dickens illustrator who created 'The Great 100 Rat Match,' and Scotland (specifically Kelso or Edinburgh) as Robertson's birthplace. Cross-validation through multiple independent sources (Wikipedia, Dictionary of National Biography, Google Books, various databases) confirms accuracy. Integration assessment: All members provided complementary evidence supporting the same conclusion with different but equally valid research approaches. Final validation: Scotland is definitively correct as the birthplace, with specific location being either Kelso or Edinburgh based on consistent biographical sources.",
