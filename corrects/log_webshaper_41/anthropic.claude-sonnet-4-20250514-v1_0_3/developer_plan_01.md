# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_41  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-10 15:44:48

## Plan Content
```
Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify international airports in London that feature energy harvesting floor tiles. Focus on searching for keywords including 'London airport energy harvesting floor tiles', 'Heathrow Gatwick energy harvesting technology', 'London airport renewable energy floor', and 'airport kinetic energy harvesting tiles London'. Look for news articles, press releases, or technical reports that mention specific London airports implementing energy harvesting floor tile technology, then identify which of these airports submitted expansion proposals that were later non-shortlisted.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to first identify which London airport has energy harvesting floor tiles before we can trace their expansion proposals, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific London airport with this technology and gather initial information about their expansion activities, (4) This directly targets the first requirement of identifying the airport with energy harvesting floor tiles before investigating their proposal submission timeline

### Development Step 1: Identify City Granted October 2019 Planning Permission for Homeless Shelter-to-Flats Conversion near Bournemouth

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the city where a developer received planning permission in October 2019 to convert a homeless shelter into flats. Focus on searching for news articles, planning applications, and local government records from October 2019 using keywords like 'October 2019 planning permission homeless shelter flats conversion', 'homeless shelter converted flats October 2019', and 'planning permission shelter housing development 2019'. Cross-reference results with locations that have Bournemouth Seafront areas containing Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th century historic villas, and conservation areas designated in 1987.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban development due diligence and site feasibility reports for real estate investors seeking post-2019 conversion opportunities
- Automated permit monitoring and alert system for local council planning officers tracking homeless shelter redevelopments
- Heritage conservation compliance checks for architects working on historic villa conversions in designated 1987 conservation areas
- Legal due diligence toolkit for property lawyers compiling planning application histories and decision notices for October 2019 developments
- Investigative journalism workflows for housing reporters analyzing social impact of shelter-to-flat conversions in seafront communities
- Academic case study preparation for urban planning students researching adaptive reuse projects around Bournemouth’s Russell-Cotes precinct
- Competitive intelligence extraction for residential developers benchmarking October 2019 planning permissions on East Cliff Lift vicinity
- GIS-enabled analysis pipeline for smart-city teams mapping redevelopment trends and regulatory zones along UK coastal conservation areas

### Development Step 2: Find City with October 2019 Planning Permission for Homeless Shelter-to-Flats Conversion

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the city where a developer received planning permission in October 2019 to convert a homeless shelter into flats. Focus on searching for news articles, planning applications, and local government records from October 2019 using keywords like 'October 2019 planning permission homeless shelter flats conversion', 'homeless shelter converted flats October 2019', and 'planning permission shelter housing development 2019'. Cross-reference results with locations that have Bournemouth Seafront areas containing Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th century historic villas, and conservation areas designated in 1987.

**Use Cases**:
- Real estate investment due diligence: automatically extract and verify October 2019 planning permissions for property conversions (e.g., homeless shelter to flats) to assess redevelopment opportunities in Bournemouth and similar coastal towns
- Urban planning research and heritage conservation: cross-reference local government records with landmark datasets (Russell-Cotes Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th-century villas) to study the impact of conservation areas designated in 1987 on new developments
- Automated news media fact-checking: scan and analyze web articles for developer names, planning permission dates, and locations to validate claims about high-profile projects (e.g., Harry Redknapp’s Pierfront Properties approval)
- Government transparency dashboards: aggregate and visualize planning application outcomes by date, developer, and city (such as Bournemouth in October 2019) to support public policy analysis and citizen engagement
- Legal property compliance monitoring: track the approval status of planning permissions for former homeless accommodations to ensure developers comply with council conditions and heritage requirements
- Tourism and cultural guide enrichment: verify the presence of specific landmarks and recent development changes (flats conversion, conservation areas) when generating up-to-date travel guides for Bournemouth’s seafront attractions
- Social impact assessment for NGOs: compile and analyze data on shelter-to-housing conversion projects approved in 2019 to report on local homelessness alleviation efforts and inform funding decisions

### Development Step 10: Search Harry Kewell’s Crawley Town managerial record and win-loss statistics since May 2017

**Description**: Search for Harry Kewell's complete managerial record at Crawley Town, focusing on his win-loss statistics during his tenure from May 2017 onwards. Search for keywords including 'Harry Kewell Crawley Town managerial record wins', 'Harry Kewell Crawley statistics manager', 'Crawley Town Harry Kewell results 2017-2018', and 'Harry Kewell manager win percentage Crawley'. Look for official club records, sports databases, or detailed match reports that document the total number of games won during his time as manager of Crawley Town.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated sports journalism workflows: extract and compile football manager records (games managed, wins, win rates, tenure) from online search snippets into JSON for rapid article publication.
- Football club recruitment analysis: process historical managerial performance data—total games, win percentages, league positions—to inform candidate evaluations and hiring decisions.
- Sports betting analytics integration: aggregate manager and team performance stats into predictive models by scraping win-loss records and win rates from web search results.

The search strategy uses 15 different query combinations targeting: (1) Direct searches for London airports with energy harvesting floor tiles, (2) Specific airport names (Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, London City) combined with energy harvesting terms, (3) Technology-specific searches including Pavegen and kinetic energy systems, (4) Cross-references with expansion proposals and non-shortlisted status. The code systematically processes each search result, identifies key indicators (airport names, energy harvesting terms, expansion-related keywords), calculates relevance scores, and saves all findings to a timestamped JSON file in workspace/ for detailed analysis. The output includes comprehensive logging with print statements showing search progress, result relevance scoring, and airport-specific analysis to help identify which London airports have implemented energy harvesting floor tile technology and their expansion proposal status.',

The script executed 15 different search queries and successfully collected search results, with one highly relevant finding: Heathrow Airport has Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles installed in a corridor. The code found specific evidence of energy harvesting technology at Heathrow and saved all results to 'workspace/london_airport_energy_harvesting_search_results_[timestamp].json'. However, the **PLAN** requires identifying which airports with energy harvesting tiles also had expansion proposals that were non-shortlisted. The current results show Heathrow has the technology but doesn't yet establish the expansion proposal connection. **PLAN** alignment: 70% complete. Next step: Analyze the saved results more thoroughly and conduct additional targeted searches specifically for 'Heathrow expansion proposal non-shortlisted' or 'London airport expansion shortlist energy harvesting' to complete the expansion proposal requirement.",

    "description": "This implementation analyzes the previously saved search results to identify London airports with energy harvesting floor tiles and investigates their expansion proposal status. The code first inspects the JSON file structure to understand the data format, then systematically processes the search results to extract key findings. Based on the tester feedback confirming Heathrow has Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles, the code focuses on analyzing Heathrow-specific results and conducts additional targeted searches for expansion proposal information. The analysis categorizes results by airport, identifies high-relevance matches (airports + energy terms), and specifically looks for evidence of Heathrow's Pavegen installation in corridor areas. The code then performs Phase 2 searches targeting 'Heathrow expansion proposal non-shortlisted' and related queries to complete the PLAN requirement of identifying which airports with energy harvesting tiles had non-shortlisted expansion proposals. All findings are compiled into a comprehensive analysis JSON file with evidence sources, technology details, and expansion status investigation results.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - Code encountered a NameError on line 67 where 'matching_airports' is not defined. The error occurred during the result categorization loop where the code tried to check if 'gatwick' was in matching_airports, but the variable wasn't properly defined in that scope. The code successfully loaded and inspected the search results file (178 total results from 15 queries), confirmed the data structure, and identified that Heathrow has Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles. However, the analysis phase failed due to the variable scope issue, preventing completion of the airport categorization and expansion proposal investigation. **PLAN** alignment: 40% - energy harvesting technology confirmed at Heathrow but analysis incomplete. Recommended fix: Define matching_airports properly by accessing result.get('matching_airports', []) within the loop instead of using the undefined variable name.",

    "description": "This implementation fixes the variable scoping error from the previous attempt and conducts a comprehensive analysis of the London airport energy harvesting search results. The code first properly inspects the JSON file structure to understand the data format, then systematically processes all 178 search results with correct variable scoping by accessing result.get('matching_airports', []) within each iteration. It categorizes results by airport (Heathrow, Gatwick, others), identifies high-relevance matches combining airport and energy terms, and specifically analyzes Heathrow results that mention energy harvesting technology. The code confirms Heathrow has Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles installed in corridor areas powering interactive lighting displays. For Phase 2, it conducts additional targeted searches for Heathrow expansion proposal status using 8 specific queries about shortlist status, rejection, and planning permissions. All findings are compiled into a comprehensive analysis JSON file with evidence sources, technology details, search statistics, and expansion investigation results. The implementation provides detailed progress reporting through extensive print statements and saves both expansion search results and final analysis to workspace files for further review.",

The error occurred during the result categorization loop where the code attempted to use 'result_matching_airports' instead of accessing the data from the result dictionary. The code successfully loaded the search results file (178 total results from 15 queries), inspected the data structure, and began processing the results to identify London airports with energy harvesting floor tiles. However, the analysis failed during the categorization phase due to incorrect variable references - the code should use result.get('matching_airports', []) instead of 'result_matching_airports'. **PLAN** alignment: 30% - data loaded successfully but analysis incomplete due to variable scope error. Recommended fix: Replace 'result_matching_airports', 'result_matching_energy', and 'result_matching_expansion' with proper dictionary access using result.get() method to access the matching arrays from each result.",

    "description": "This implementation fixes the variable scoping errors from previous attempts by properly accessing the result dictionary keys using result.get() method instead of undefined variables. The code first inspects the JSON file structure to understand the data format (178 search results from 15 queries), then systematically processes each result by correctly accessing 'matching_airports', 'matching_energy', and 'matching_expansion' arrays from the result dictionary. It categorizes results by airport type, identifies high-relevance matches combining airport and energy terms, and specifically analyzes Heathrow results that mention energy harvesting technology. The code confirms Heathrow has Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles installed in corridor areas. For Phase 2, it conducts additional targeted searches for Heathrow expansion proposal status using 8 specific queries about shortlist status, rejection, and planning permissions. All findings are compiled into a comprehensive analysis JSON file with evidence sources, technology details, search statistics, and expansion investigation results. The implementation provides detailed progress reporting and saves both expansion search results and final analysis to workspace files for further review, addressing the PLAN requirement to identify London airports with energy harvesting floor tiles and their expansion proposal status.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - Code encountered a NameError where 'result_matching_airports' is not defined on line 74. The error occurred in the list comprehension that checks for other London airports, where the code tried to use the variable 'result_matching_airports' instead of accessing the data directly from the result dictionary. The code successfully loaded and inspected the search results file (178 total results from 15 queries), confirmed the data structure with proper keys, and began the analysis phase. However, it failed during result categorization due to incorrect variable usage in the list comprehension. **PLAN** alignment: 35% - data successfully loaded and structure confirmed, but analysis incomplete due to variable scope error. Recommended fix: In the list comprehension on line 74, use 'result.get('matching_airports', [])' directly instead of the undefined 'result_matching_airports' variable. The variable assignment approach works for simple conditionals but not within list comprehensions where the variables need to be accessed directly from the result dictionary.",

    "description": 'This implementation fixes all variable scoping errors by using simple variable assignments (airports, energy, expansion) instead of complex variable names, and accessing the result dictionary directly in all conditional checks. The code first inspects the JSON file structure to understand the data format (178 search results from 15 queries), then systematically processes each result by correctly accessing the matching arrays from the result dictionary. It categorizes results by airport type, identifies high-relevance matches combining airport and energy terms, and specifically analyzes Heathrow results that mention energy harvesting technology. The code confirms Heathrow has Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles installed in corridor areas powering interactive lighting displays. For Phase 2, it conducts additional targeted searches for Heathrow expansion proposal status using 8 specific queries about shortlist status, rejection, and planning permissions. All findings are compiled into a comprehensive analysis JSON file with evidence sources, technology details, search statistics, and expansion investigation results. The implementation provides detailed progress reporting through extensive print statements and saves both expansion search results and final analysis to workspace files, addressing the PLAN requirement to identify London airports with energy harvesting floor tiles and investigate their expansion proposal status.',

    "feedback": "Execution failed - Code encountered a NameError where 'matching_airports' is not defined on line 74. The error occurred during the result categorization loop in a list comprehension that checks for other London airports. The code successfully loaded the search results file (178 total results from 15 queries), inspected the data structure, and began processing results. However, it failed when trying to access 'matching_airports' in the list comprehension 'any(airport in matching_airports for airport in [...])' because the variable was defined inside the loop but used in a nested comprehension scope. **PLAN** alignment: 35% - data loaded and structure confirmed, but analysis incomplete due to variable scope error. Recommended fix: Replace the list comprehension with a simpler approach by checking 'any(airport in result.get('matching_airports', []) for airport in ['stansted', 'luton', 'london city'])' to directly access the dictionary key instead of relying on the loop variable.",

    "description": "This implementation completely fixes the variable scoping errors by using direct dictionary access (result.get('matching_airports', [])) in all conditional checks and replacing the problematic list comprehension with a simple loop structure. The code first inspects the JSON file structure to understand the data format (178 search results from 15 queries), then systematically processes each result by directly accessing the matching arrays from the result dictionary without intermediate variable assignments. It categorizes results by airport type using explicit conditional checks, identifies high-relevance matches combining airport and energy terms, and specifically analyzes Heathrow results that mention energy harvesting technology. The code confirms Heathrow has Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles installed in corridor areas powering interactive lighting displays. For Phase 2, it conducts additional targeted searches for Heathrow expansion proposal status using 8 specific queries about shortlist status, rejection, and planning permissions. All findings are compiled into a comprehensive analysis JSON file with evidence sources, technology details, search statistics, and expansion investigation results. The implementation provides detailed progress reporting through extensive print statements and saves both expansion search results and final analysis to workspace files, fully addressing the PLAN requirement to identify London airports with energy harvesting floor tiles and investigate their expansion proposal status.",

The analysis processed 178 search results from 15 queries and successfully identified Heathrow Airport as having Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles installed in Terminal 3 corridor areas powering interactive lighting displays. Found 17 high-relevance results confirming Heathrow's energy harvesting technology with detailed evidence from multiple sources. Phase 2 expansion investigation was conducted with 8 additional searches that found 14 relevant results about Heathrow's expansion proposal status, including information about shortlist status, rejections, and planning permissions. The code generated comprehensive output with detailed findings, saved analysis results to 'london_airports_energy_harvesting_final_analysis.json', and saved expansion search results to a timestamped file. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - successfully identified London airport with energy harvesting floor tiles (Heathrow) and conducted thorough investigation of expansion proposal status. The lengthy output (200+ lines) contains valuable analysis results and should be saved to 'workspace/comprehensive_london_airport_energy_analysis.txt' for future reference and documentation purposes.",

    "description": "This implementation conducts a comprehensive analysis of Heathrow's expansion proposal shortlist status by first inspecting the expansion search results file structure, then systematically categorizing the 14 expansion-related results into shortlisted evidence, non-shortlisted evidence, rejected evidence, and approved evidence. The analysis reveals that Heathrow was actually shortlisted by the Airports Commission (confirmed by multiple sources) for its north-west runway proposal, making it ineligible for the PLAN criteria which specifically asks for airports that were 'non-shortlisted'. The code provides detailed evidence analysis showing that while Heathrow has Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles in Terminal 3 and did submit expansion proposals, it was shortlisted rather than non-shortlisted. The timeline analysis shows Heathrow was shortlisted by the Airports Commission, faced various legal challenges and rejections, but ultimately received Supreme Court approval in 2020. The final conclusion determines that no London international airports meet both criteria (energy harvesting tiles + non-shortlisted expansion proposals), as Heathrow has the tiles but was shortlisted, while other London airports lack clear evidence of energy harvesting floor tile technology. The comprehensive analysis is saved to a final conclusion JSON file documenting all findings, evidence sources, and the definitive answer to the PLAN question.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed a comprehensive final analysis that definitively answers the **PLAN** question. The analysis successfully processed all previous search data (178 energy harvesting results + 14 expansion results) and determined that Heathrow Airport has Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles in Terminal 3 but was actually SHORTLISTED by the Airports Commission, not non-shortlisted. The code provided detailed evidence analysis showing 5 sources confirming Heathrow was shortlisted, 1 source mentioning non-shortlisted options (but not Heathrow specifically), 5 sources about later rejections/legal challenges, and 4 sources about Supreme Court approval. The final conclusion clearly states that NO London international airports meet the full criteria of having both energy harvesting floor tiles AND non-shortlisted expansion proposals. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - question definitively answered with comprehensive evidence.

True\nEvidence of shortlisting: 5 sources\nEvidence of non-shortlisting: 1 sources\n\n📋 KEY TIMELINE:\n1. Airports Commission DID shortlist Heathrow (confirmed by multiple sources)\n2. Heathrow's north-west runway was one of three shortlisted schemes\n3. Later faced various legal challenges and rejections\n4. Supreme Court ultimately overturned blocks in 2020\n5. Current status: Can seek planning permission\n\n🔍 ANSWER TO PLAN QUESTION:\nThe question asks for airports with energy harvesting tiles that submitted\nexpansion proposals that were 'non-shortlisted'.\n\nHEATHROW ANALYSIS:\n✅ Has energy harvesting floor tiles: YES (Pavegen tiles in Terminal 3)\n✅ Submitted expansion proposals: YES (third runway proposal)\n❌ Was non-shortlisted: NO (was actually shortlisted by Airports Commission)\n\nTherefore, Heathrow does NOT meet the criteria as it was shortlisted, not non-shortlisted.\n\n💾 Comprehensive final analysis saved to: workspace_webshaper_41/london_airports_energy_harvesting_expansion_final_conclusion.json\n\n🏁 PLAN COMPLETION STATUS:\n✅ Identified London airports with energy harvesting floor tiles: Heathrow\n✅ Investigated expansion proposal status: Heathrow was shortlisted\n❌ Found airports meeting full criteria (energy tiles + non-shortlisted): None\n\n🎯 FINAL ANSWER: No London international airports were found that both:\n   1. Feature energy harvesting floor tiles, AND\n   2. Submitted expansion proposals that were non-shortlisted\n\nHeathrow has the energy harvesting tiles but was shortlisted, not non-shortlisted.",

    "description": "PLAN COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - The comprehensive web search and analysis has definitively answered the question about international airports in London that feature energy harvesting floor tiles and submitted non-shortlisted expansion proposals. \n\nKEY FINDINGS:\n✅ Successfully identified Heathrow Airport as having Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles installed in Terminal 3 corridor (the 'Flow' installation with 100 colored tiles)\n✅ Confirmed through 17 high-relevance search results from multiple sources including official Pavegen case studies, news articles, and technical reports\n✅ Thoroughly investigated Heathrow's expansion proposal status through 8 additional targeted searches yielding 14 relevant results\n✅ Determined that Heathrow was SHORTLISTED (not non-shortlisted) by the Airports Commission for its north-west runway expansion proposal\n✅ Analyzed timeline showing Heathrow was shortlisted, faced legal challenges, but ultimately received Supreme Court approval in 2020\n\nFINAL ANSWER: No London international airports meet both criteria. Heathrow has the energy harvesting floor tiles but was shortlisted rather than non-shortlisted for expansion. Other London airports (Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, London City) lack clear evidence of energy harvesting floor tile technology.\n\nFILES CREATED:\n- workspace/london_airport_energy_harvesting_search_results_[timestamp].json (178 search results from 15 queries)\n- workspace/heathrow_expansion_search_results_[timestamp].json (14 expansion-related results from 8 queries)\n- workspace/london_airports_energy_harvesting_final_analysis.json (comprehensive analysis)\n- workspace/london_airports_energy_harvesting_expansion_final_conclusion.json (definitive conclusion)\n\nThe PLAN requirements have been 100% satisfied with comprehensive evidence-based research, detailed analysis, and a clear definitive answer supported by multiple authoritative sources.",
