### City Where Homeless Shelter Conversion to Flats Was Approved in October 2019

**TASK**: "In October 2019, a developer received planning permission to convert a homeless shelter into flats in a city. This developer had developed a building located in an area along the Bournemouth Seafront, which includes the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum and the East Cliff Lift, contains historic villas from the 19th Century, and was designated as a conservation area in 1987. What is the name of this city?"

### Total Wheel Count of Museum’s Steam Locomotives

**TASK**: The attached file shows the locomotives in the collection of a North American railroad museum. How many wheels do the listed steam locomotives have in total? Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx
