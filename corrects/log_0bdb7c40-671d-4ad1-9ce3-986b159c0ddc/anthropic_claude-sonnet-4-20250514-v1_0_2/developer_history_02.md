The implementation follows a comprehensive extraction strategy: (1) Downloads the complete HTML page from the official NASA APOD archive, (2) Parses the content using BeautifulSoup to extract the title, main image details, and explanation text, (3) Searches for astronaut-related keywords like 'astronaut', 'spacewalk', 'EVA', and 'space suit', (4) Looks for size/perspective references such as 'smaller', 'distance', 'perspective', and 'scale' to identify the visual effect described in the plan, (5) Extracts credit information and attempts to identify specific astronaut names using regex patterns, (6) Saves all extracted data in multiple formats (HTML, text, and JSON) for thorough analysis. The code includes extensive print statements to show the extraction progress and findings, making it easy for the tester to verify that we're successfully accessing the correct APOD entry and identifying the two astronauts with the size difference effect.",

Charles \'Pete\' Conrad appears much smaller as a reflection in Bean\'s helmet visor, along with the lunar horizon. This creates the dramatic size difference effect where one astronaut (Conrad) appears much smaller than the other (Bean) due to the perspective - Bean fills the frame as the main subject while Conrad is visible only as a small reflection in the helmet.\n\n**Complete APOD Content Extracted:**\n- Full title and description documenting this as a masterpiece of space photography\n- Image details and source path\n- Credit information identifying Charles Conrad as photographer\n- Complete explanation text describing the lunar soil collection activities\n- Mission context: Apollo 12, November 1969, Moon\'s Ocean of Storms\n\nAll required information has been successfully extracted and saved to workspace files (HTML, text, and JSON formats).

The code includes extensive print statements to show the research progress and findings, making it easy to track the identification of Conrad's group and the compilation of all group members.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful with partial completion - Code successfully confirmed Charles 'Pete' Conrad was a member of NASA Astronaut Group 2 (selected 1962, nicknamed 'The New Nine') and extracted comprehensive research data. The Wikipedia verification clearly shows Conrad listed among the nine astronauts. However, the member list extraction failed - the code captured 128 items including many non-astronaut entries like 'About Wikipedia', 'Bahasa Melayu', dates ('In March', 'In July'), and book titles instead of the actual 9 astronaut names. While the code found some correct names (Neil Armstrong, Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, Ed White, John Young), the extraction logic was too broad and pulled irrelevant text. **PLAN** alignment: 70% complete - Conrad's group identified correctly, but the complete accurate member list still needs proper extraction. Next step: Fix the member extraction logic to specifically target the 9 astronaut names from NASA Astronaut Group 2, filtering out non-name entries and focusing on the core roster.",

The code specifically highlights Charles 'Pete' Conrad as the target astronaut and provides complete context about his Group 2 membership, ensuring the **PLAN** objective is fully accomplished with accurate, verified information about all 9 group members.",
