# Planner Initialization

## Task
In NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day on 2006 January 21, two astronauts are visible, with one appearing much smaller than the other. As of August 2023, out of the astronauts in the NASA Astronaut Group that the smaller astronaut was a member of, which one spent the least time in space, and how many minutes did he spend in space, rounded to the nearest minute? Exclude any astronauts who did not spend any time in space. Give the last name of the astronaut, separated from the number of minutes by a semicolon.

## Episodic Examples
### First name of the firm that designed the Chicago landmark named for APOD horizon city namesake

**TASK**: During the first week of August 2015, one of the NASA Astronomy Pictures of the Day shows the lights of a city on the horizon. The namesake of this city also has a landmark building in Chicago named after him. What is the name of the architectural firm that designed this landmark building? Give the first name appearing in the name of the firm as of June 2023.

Based on the HISTORY feedback from the tester, the comprehensive list of all Washington state county seats has been successfully compiled and verified. The final implementation correctly extracted all 39 counties and their respective county seats from Wikipedia's authoritative List of counties in Washington page. The data extraction was fixed to properly read county seats from the correct column (index 2) instead of FIPS codes, resulting in accurate mappings like 'Adams County -> Ritzville', 'King County -> Seattle', and 'Thurston County -> Olympia'. \n\nKey achievements:\n1. **Complete Coverage**: Successfully identified all 39 Washington state counties and their county seats\n2. **Authoritative Source**: Used Wikipedia's structured data which references official government sources\n3. **Data Verification**: Confirmed exactly 39 counties as expected for Washington state\n4. **Multiple Output Formats**: Saved results in both JSON and CSV formats in workspace directory\n5. **Data Quality**: Clean extraction with citation markers removed and proper formatting\n6. **Additional Reference Data**: Included FIPS codes for enhanced utility\n\nOutput files created:\n- workspace/wa_county_seats.json: Complete structured data with county, county_seat, fips_code, and source fields\n- workspace/wa_county_seats.csv: CSV format for easy import into other applications\n- workspace/wiki_wa_counties.html: Cached source HTML for verification\n\nThe tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with accurate data extraction and no further development needed. All Washington state county seats have been successfully compiled from authoritative government-referenced sources.",
