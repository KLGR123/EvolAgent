                Marseille<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task decomposition: This multi-step historical research problem required (1) identifying the lock system designer for the abandoned 1880s Panama Canal project, (2) determining that person's birthplace, (3) finding the July 1962 train derailment near that location, and (4) establishing the train's destination. All three members demonstrated excellent systematic approaches with identical final conclusions. Member evaluation: Member 1 used comprehensive search methodology with 24 relevant results for the Panama Canal research, definitively identified Gustave Eiffel as the lock designer, confirmed Dijon as his birthplace through 64 search results, and located the July 23, 1962 Paris-Marseilles express derailment with clear documentation. Member 2 employed similar rigorous research techniques, gathering 105 search results for the train derailment with 79 high-relevance matches, providing extensive verification from authoritative sources including New York Times archives. Member 3 followed parallel methodology with 64 relevant results and 29 high-relevance matches, confirming all key details. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: all members identified (1) Gustave Eiffel as the French Panama Canal lock system designer, (2) Dijon, France as his birthplace, (3) July 23, 1962 Paris-Marseille Express derailment at Velars-sur-Ouche near Dijon, and (4) Marseille as the train's intended destination. No contradictions exist between approaches. Integration assessment: The consistent findings across independent research paths provide high confidence. All members used appropriate historical research methodologies, cross-referenced multiple authoritative sources (New York Times, French archives, academic sources), and maintained proper documentation. Final validation: The logical chain is complete and verified - Eiffel designed the abandoned 1880s French Panama Canal locks, was born in Dijon, and the July 1962 derailment near Dijon involved Express 53 bound for Marseille.
