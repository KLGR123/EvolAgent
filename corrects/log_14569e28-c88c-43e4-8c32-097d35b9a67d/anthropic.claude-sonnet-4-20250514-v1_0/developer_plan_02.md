# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 14569e28-c88c-43e4-8c32-097d35b9a67d  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-30 15:33:28

## Plan Content
```
Analyze the provided Unlambda code `r```````````.F.o.r. .p.e.n.g.u.i.n.si to identify what character or text is missing to make it output 'For penguins'. Use the Unlambda research from workspace/unlambda_research.txt to understand the syntax, then trace through the execution flow of the given code. Compare the expected output 'For penguins' with what the current code would produce, identifying the specific missing element needed for correction.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal next step because: (1) We have completed research on Unlambda syntax and the 'r' combinator functionality, (2) The previous research provides the foundation to analyze the specific code provided, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the exact missing character or text by comparing intended vs actual output, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK of finding what needs to be added to correct the code
