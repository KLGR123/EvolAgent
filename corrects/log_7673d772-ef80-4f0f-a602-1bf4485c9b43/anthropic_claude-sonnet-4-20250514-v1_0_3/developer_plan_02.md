# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Access the Federal Rules of Evidence section on Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website and systematically analyze all articles to identify which article contains the word 'witnesses' in the most rule titles as of 2021. Count the occurrences of 'witnesses' in titles across all FRE articles and determine which article has the highest count.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have identified that the fifth alphabetical federal rule section is 'Federal Rules of Evidence' from the previous research, (2) We now need to analyze all articles within the FRE to find which one contains 'witnesses' in the most titles, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific article with the highest count of 'witnesses' in rule titles as of 2021, (4) This will establish which article we need to examine for the first rule and its last amendment to find the deleted word.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 5: Testimony in 1933 Dillinger Jailbreak and Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern Gang Convictions

**Description**: Search specifically for information about the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger that resulted in the death of a sheriff and led to Harry Pierpont's conviction. Focus on identifying who provided testimony in this case and cross-reference with any testimony that also helped convict other gang leaders from the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang. Search for keywords including '1933 jailbreak John Dillinger fake credentials', 'Harry Pierpont sheriff death conviction', 'Lima Ohio jail break 1933', 'Dillinger escape plan testimony', and 'witness testimony Pierpont conviction'.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal research teams automating archival retrieval of witness testimony and court records to support precedent analysis in organized crime defense cases
- True-crime podcast producers aggregating and fact-checking 1930s jailbreak narratives and witness statements via API calls for immersive episode scripting
- Academic historians cross-referencing digital newspaper archives and trial transcripts to reconstruct the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang‚Äôs network for a peer-reviewed journal article
- Law enforcement cold-case units integrating JSON-formatted witness metadata and snippet analysis to uncover new leads in unsolved sheriff homicide investigations
- Educational technology platforms generating interactive timelines of historical jailbreak events by extracting dates, locations, and key participants from court document repositories
- Digital humanities researchers employing automated keyword searches and snippet classification to map testimony patterns across multiple 1930s bank robbery trials
- Investigative journalists conducting rapid background checks on historical criminal figures by cross-referencing API-fetched search results with court verdict data
- Insurance risk assessment teams analyzing historical crime incident data and witness testimony to model liability exposure for high-risk property underwriting

### Development Step 4: Identify Witnesses in 1933 Dillinger Fake-Credentials Jailbreak, Sheriff‚Äôs Death, and Pierpont-Bridgewater Convictions

**Description**: Search specifically for information about the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger that resulted in the death of a sheriff and led to Harry Pierpont's conviction. Focus on identifying who provided testimony in this case and cross-reference with any testimony that also helped convict other gang leaders from the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang. Search for keywords including '1933 jailbreak John Dillinger fake credentials', 'Harry Pierpont sheriff death conviction', 'Lima Ohio jail break 1933', 'Dillinger escape plan testimony', and 'witness testimony Pierpont conviction'.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal case preparation for defense attorneys researching witness testimony and trial records from the 1933 Dillinger jailbreak to identify procedural errors or new exculpatory evidence.
- Academic criminal history analysis for a university professor compiling and categorizing primary sources on Harry Pierpont‚Äôs conviction and related gang trials for a peer-reviewed journal article.
- True-crime journalism deep dive to automate aggregation of newspaper archives, court transcripts, and eyewitness accounts around the Lima, Ohio jailbreak and sheriff‚Äôs death for an investigative series.
- Museum exhibit content curation to source and verify authentic trial documents, testimonies, and photos for an interactive Prohibition-era crime display on John Dillinger and his associates.
- Genealogy and family-history research for descendants tracing ancestral connections to the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang through court records and witness lists from 1933.
- Digital archiving and preservation for a historical society automating the discovery and categorization of scanned legal filings, trial transcripts, and newspaper clippings relating to the sheriff‚Äôs shooting.
- Law-enforcement training module development to build detailed case studies on investigative techniques, fake credentials methods, and witness testimony cross-referencing used in the Pierpont trial for modern detective academies.

### Development Step 3: Identify 2022 Legume Wikipedia content violations and the meaning of ‚ÄúR‚Äù in core policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate compliance auditing for an internal knowledge base: automatically parse HTML edit histories to identify content removals before December 2022, map them against three core documentation policies, and report what ‚ÄúR‚Äù stands for in each policy.
- Academic media studies research on Wikipedia edit behavior: extract 2022 pre-December policy violations and analyze how often core policies (including the ‚ÄúR‚Äù for Reliability) are cited in public logs.
- Newsroom fact-checking workflow: monitor high-traffic Wikipedia pages‚Äô edit history HTML to flag potential vandalism or copyright removals in 2022 and correlate them with the three core policies‚Äô ‚ÄúR‚Äù references.
- Open-source project documentation QA: scan project wiki talk pages‚Äô HTML to detect spam, deletion requests, or policy breaches before December 2022 and verify adherence to the trio of core guidelines, especially the ‚ÄúR‚Äù criterion.
- Legal discovery and e-discovery support: process archived HTML logs from Wikipedia to extract instances of content disputes in 2022, identify the violated policy types, and determine the meaning of ‚ÄúR‚Äù in each policy context.
- Government transparency dashboard: analyze municipal information pages‚Äô edit histories to track policy enforcement actions taken before December 2022 and highlight the role of ‚ÄúR‚Äù (Reliability) in official content standards.
- Nonprofit misinformation monitoring: parse HTML of selected topic pages‚Äô talk and history files to uncover 2022 content violations, categorize them under the three core policies, and detail how ‚ÄúR‚Äù shapes the reliable sourcing rule.
- Enterprise knowledge management automation: integrate a parser for wiki-style HTML logs to continuously detect policy violations (including ‚ÄúR‚Äù-related reliability issues) in user-generated content during 2022‚Äôs first eleven months.

### Development Step 41: Identify shared critical word in two authors‚Äô quotes from Midkiff‚Äôs June 2014 Fafnir article

**Description**: Access Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the Fafnir journal to extract the full text and identify the specific word that was quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions. Parse the article content systematically to locate quotes from multiple authors that contain the same critical word about dragon portrayals.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic literature review automation for humanities scholars to extract and compare thematic criticisms across multiple authors in journal articles
- Journalism editorial workflow to scan interview transcripts and flag identical impactful quotes used by different sources
- Legal e-discovery processing to identify repeated objectionable terms quoted by multiple witnesses in deposition transcripts
- E-commerce customer feedback analysis to find the same critical word appearing in reviews from different users, highlighting recurring product pain points
- Pharmaceutical safety monitoring to detect a common adverse event descriptor quoted in separate case reports for regulatory reporting
- Cyber threat intelligence gathering to uncover recurring codewords or phrases used by distinct threat actors in intercepted communications
- Publishing quality assurance to scan author submissions for duplicated editorial comments or critiques across different chapters or manuscripts
