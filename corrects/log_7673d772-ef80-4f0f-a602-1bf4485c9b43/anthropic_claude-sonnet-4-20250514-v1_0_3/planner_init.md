# Planner Initialization

## Task
On Cornell Law School website's legal information institute, under the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically, what word was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has "witnesses" in the most titles as of 2021?

## Episodic Examples
### The phrase removed was: "**Dragons are real and live in the hearts of daring princesses**"

**TASK**: On a leap day before the year 2008, a joke was removed from the Wikipedia page for “Dragon”. What was the phrase that was removed? Give the phrase as it appeared on the page, but without punctuation.

### Identify location of Jeff Sessions’ 2005 speech

**TASK**: Where did the person—who served as U.S. Attorney General under Donald Trump, voted in favor of the bill with number H.R. 9 (109th Congress) reauthorized in 2006 and passed by a 98-0 Senate vote, and spoke in favor of the measure originally authorized in 2002 and repealed by the U.S. Senate in 2023 (whose House legislative status remains unresolved, was co-sponsored by Christopher Cox, aims to support regime change through opposition groups, and targets a certain leader)—deliver a speech in 2005?

### Fact-Checking Greetham Citation: Verifying Quoted Passage from ‘Uncoupled’ Article

**TASK**: I need to fact-check a citation. This is the citation from the bibliography:

Greetham, David. "Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)." Textual Cultures: Texts, Contexts, Interpretation, vol. 3 no. 1, 2008, p. 45-46. Project MUSE, doi:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44.

And this is the in-line citation:

Our relationship with the authors of the works we read can often be “obscured not by a "cloak of print" but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission” (Greetham 45-46).

Does the quoted text match what is actually in the article? If Yes, answer Yes, otherwise, give me the word in my citation that does not match with the correct one (without any article).
