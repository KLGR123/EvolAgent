Identify all available federal rules categories, arrange them alphabetically, and determine which category represents the fifth section. Extract the complete list of federal rules categories to establish the alphabetical ordering and identify the target section for further analysis.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to establish the structure of Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute and identify all federal rules sections, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the federal rules categories and determine which one is fifth alphabetically, (4) This establishes the foundation for subsequently finding the article with the most 'witnesses' titles and analyzing the first rule's amendments",

    "description": "The PLAN has been successfully completed. The analysis of Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website has been finished with 100% alignment to objectives. All federal rules categories were identified, properly cleaned and deduplicated, arranged alphabetically, and the fifth category was correctly determined to be 'Federal Rules of Evidence'. The corrected analysis file was saved to workspace containing the complete results. The task achieved all specified goals: (1) Navigated to Cornell Law website, (2) Located federal rules section, (3) Identified all 6 available federal rules categories, (4) Arranged them alphabetically, and (5) Determined that 'Federal Rules of Evidence' represents the fifth section alphabetically. No further development is required as the tester confirmed successful completion.",

    "plan": "Access the Federal Rules of Evidence section on Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website and systematically analyze all rules to identify which article has 'witnesses' appearing in the most rule titles as of 2021. Count the occurrences of 'witnesses' in titles across all Federal Rules of Evidence articles, then identify the article with the highest count for further analysis of its first rule's amendment history.",
    "description": "This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified that Federal Rules of Evidence is the fifth federal rules section alphabetically from the previous analysis, (2) We now need to examine all rules within this section to find which article contains 'witnesses' in the most titles, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific article with the highest count of 'witnesses' in rule titles as of 2021, (4) This will allow us to then focus on the first rule of that article and analyze its amendment history to find what word was deleted in the last amendment",
