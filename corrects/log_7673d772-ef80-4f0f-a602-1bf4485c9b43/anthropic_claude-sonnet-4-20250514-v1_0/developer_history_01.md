This initial step examines the main website structure, identifies navigation elements, and locates potential federal rules links. The code systematically searches through all page links, analyzes navigation sections, and tests common URL patterns to find the main federal rules page.

The script found 115 total links and identified 10 federal rules related links, with proper analysis and file storage of homepage data. However, the **PLAN** requires identifying ALL federal rules categories, arranging them alphabetically, and determining the fifth section - none of this was completed since the code stopped after homepage analysis. **PLAN** alignment: 30% complete. Next step: Access the identified federal rules URL (https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules), scrape all federal rules categories from that page, sort them alphabetically, and identify which category is the fifth in alphabetical order.',

The code implements multiple strategies: (1) Searching for list elements and navigation containers, (2) Finding all rule-related links, and (3) Using regex patterns to identify 'Federal Rules of...' text. It consolidates findings, removes duplicates, sorts categories alphabetically, and identifies the fifth category. Results are saved to workspace for verification. This completes the PLAN objective by providing the complete alphabetical list of federal rules categories and determining which represents the fifth section.",

    "feedback": "Partial success with data quality issues - Code executed without errors and successfully accessed the Cornell Law federal rules page, extracting federal rules categories and attempting alphabetical sorting. However, there are significant data quality problems in the consolidation step that corrupted the results. The code found the correct individual categories (Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Civil Procedure, Criminal Procedure, Evidence, Bankruptcy Procedure, and U.S. Supreme Court Rules) but the regex pattern matching created malformed concatenated entries like 'Federal Rules of Appellate ProcedureFederal Rules of Civil Procedure...' which polluted the final alphabetical list. The reported fifth category 'Federal Rules of Civil Procedure' is likely incorrect due to these corrupted entries. **PLAN** alignment: 70% complete - categories were found but sorting is unreliable. Next step: Fix the category consolidation logic to properly clean and deduplicate the individual rule categories, then re-sort alphabetically to get the accurate fifth category. The detailed analysis file was saved to workspace which is good for reference.",
