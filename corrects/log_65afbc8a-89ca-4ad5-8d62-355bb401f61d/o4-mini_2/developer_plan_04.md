# Developer Plan #4 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 4  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-04 01:17:47

## Plan Content
```
Generate an adjacency list of legal cardinal two-cell moves by reading workspace/grid_data.json and including edges only when the target cell’s fill_color is not '0099FF'; save the adjacency list to workspace/adjacency_cardinal.json.
```

## Plan Description
```
This step corrects the previous adjacency graph by enforcing the rule that only the landing cell’s fill_color matters and that blue cells (fill_color '0099FF') are forbidden. Producing this accurate adjacency list is necessary before performing BFS to find the START→END path and to determine the coordinate and color of the cell landed on in the 11th move.

### Development Step 1: Visualizing Earl Smith’s Green Cells in Land Plot Excel Spreadsheet

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel spreadsheet file data/gaia/2023/validation/5cfb274c-0207-4aa7-9575-6ac0bd95d9b2.xlsx to identify all green cells representing Earl Smith's land plots. Extract the cell positions, colors, and create a visual representation of the spreadsheet layout to understand the spatial distribution of Earl's plots relative to other landowners' plots.

**Use Cases**:
- Government cadastral mapping and land registry automation by extracting color‐coded ownership plots to update digital map databases
- Real estate due diligence workflows that visualize Excel‐highlighted property parcels owned by specific investors for investment analysis
- Agricultural field management systems identifying green‐coded crop plots per farmer to optimize resource allocation and yield forecasting
- Environmental impact assessments locating green‐highlighted conservation areas within survey spreadsheets to integrate with GIS for habitat protection
- Urban planning and zoning compliance checks extracting color‐designated residential, commercial, and industrial parcels from city planning documents
- Insurance underwriting risk profiling by mapping green-shaded floodplain or landslide-prone zones in survey workbooks for policy pricing
- Infrastructure project land acquisition tracking by compiling Excel‐flagged stakeholder parcels into visual layouts for negotiation and planning
- Legal boundary dispute resolution supporting attorneys in extracting lawyer‐marked colored cells representing contested lot lines to prepare court exhibits

### Development Step 3: Check Hamiltonian Cycle in Earl’s 49-Plot Adjacency Graph

**Description**: Solve the Hamiltonian path problem to determine if Earl can walk through every plot he owns exactly once and return to his starting plot without backtracking. Using the identified 49 green plots from the previous analysis, construct a graph where each plot is a node and edges connect adjacent plots (horizontally and vertically neighboring cells). Apply graph theory algorithms to check if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in Earl's connected land area, considering movement constraints between adjacent plots only.

**Use Cases**:
- Precision agriculture drone routing: plan a drone’s flight over 49 designated crop plots (geofenced grid cells) to apply fertilizer exactly once per plot and return to the charging station, optimizing battery life by only moving between adjacent GPS waypoints.
- Autonomous warehouse robot navigation: compute a guided vehicle’s path through every assigned storage bay in a racked warehouse (modeled as a grid) exactly once, looping back to its docking bay without retracing aisles.
- Smart city waste collection: design a garbage truck route across contiguous urban blocks (each block as a grid plot), ensuring each block is serviced exactly once before returning to the depot, under street‐adjacency constraints.
- Data center maintenance scheduling: generate a technician’s walkway through every server rack location laid out on a grid floor plan, visiting each rack exactly once and returning to the entrance without backtracking corridors.
- Facility security patrol planning: create a continuous patrol route that covers each security checkpoint on a building’s floor grid exactly once, then returns to the security office, respecting doorway adjacencies and minimizing redundant passage.
- PCB inspection automation: program a pick‐and‐place machine to traverse all test points on a printed circuit board (represented as grid nodes) exactly once, then return to the home position, optimizing head movement between adjacent points.
- Archaeological site survey mapping: plan a field surveyor’s walking route through each excavation cell in a gridded dig site exactly once, returning to the base camp while moving only between adjacent, safe-to-traverse cells.

### Development Step 5: Hamiltonian Cycle Detection in Earl’s Graph of 49 Adjacent Green Plots

**Description**: Solve the Hamiltonian path problem to determine if Earl can walk through every plot he owns exactly once and return to his starting plot without backtracking. Using the identified 49 green plots from the previous analysis, construct a graph where each plot is a node and edges connect adjacent plots (horizontally and vertically neighboring cells). Apply graph theory algorithms to check if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in Earl's connected land area, considering movement constraints between adjacent plots only.

**Use Cases**:
- Agricultural field inspection routing to walk through each crop plot exactly once and return to the barn without backtracking
- Warehouse AGV path planning to visit every pallet position in a grid-based storage area and cycle back to the charging station
- Urban street-sweeping route optimization to cover all blocks in a neighborhood exactly once and return to the depot
- Drone flight itinerary for precision agriculture, ensuring each survey plot is captured once before returning to base
- Museum guide-robot tour sequencing to present every exhibit in a gallery without revisiting any room and end at the entrance
- Solar farm maintenance walk-through scheduling so a technician can inspect each panel in sequence and return to the control hut
- PCB assembly robot routing to apply solder paste on all component pads exactly once and return to its home position
- Hospital cleaning robot cycle planning to sanitize each patient room once per shift and return to its docking station

### Development Step 2: Determine Colors of Missing Edge Piece on Rubik’s Cube from Found-Cube Constraints

**Description**: Analyze the Rubik's cube structure and systematically determine which cubes have been found based on the given constraints. Start by establishing the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cube composition: 6 center cubes (one colored face each), 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each), and 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each). Then work through each constraint: (1) All blue cubes found, (2) All cubes adjacent to orange center found plus orange center itself, (3) All green corners found, (4) All green that borders yellow found, (5) For all found orange cubes, their opposite face cubes are also found. Create a logical framework to track which specific cubes remain unfound, focusing on the edge cubes since the removed cube has exactly two colors. Determine the colors of the missing edge cube by process of elimination.

**Use Cases**:
- Automotive assembly line component verification by applying adjacency and part-opposite constraints to identify missing engine subcomponents in production
- Telecom network topology validation using JSON-based node and link constraints to pinpoint unconfigured or missing network connections
- Medical imaging segmentation QA by enforcing tissue-adjacency rules on 3D MRI model data to detect unlabeled or missing regions
- Retail warehouse inventory audit through structured SKU-location constraints and opposite-zone checks to uncover misplaced or missing stock items
- Microservices deployment health check by analyzing service-configuration JSON, dependency adjacency, and replica-opposite rules to find missing instances
- Financial ledger reconciliation using transaction adjacency and double-entry constraints to detect missing journal entries in accounting systems
- University course scheduling audit with prerequisite-adjacency and corequisite-opposite constraints to identify unscheduled required courses
- Robotic assembly validation by applying 3D part-adjacency and opposite-face constraints on CAD model exports to locate missing or misaligned panels

    "description": "1) Current task stage: We need to read workspace/grid_data.json, inspect it to learn its structure, parse cell entries, and then build an adjacency list for cardinal moves where the target cell’s fill_color != '0099FF'.  \n2) Approach: First, we print a preview of grid_data.json and identify the list of cell objects (looks under keys like 'cells', 'data', or top-level list). We then map each cell by its (row, col). For each cell, we check up/down/left/right neighbors in the map. We only add an edge if the neighbor exists and its fill_color is not '0099FF'.  \n3) Advancement: This implements the PLAN’s requirement to generate the legal moves graph and filters on fill_color.  \n4) Relationship to previous iterations: This is the first implementation building directly from the PLAN; no prior HISTORY errors to correct.  \n5) File outputs: Creates workspace/adjacency_cardinal.json, containing a JSON object mapping each cell key “row,col” to an array of its cardinal neighbor keys that satisfy the color constraint.",

    "description": "The adjacency list generation task is complete and has been verified by the tester.\n\n- The script read workspace/grid_data.json, discovered it’s a top-level list of 180 cell objects with keys row, col, value, fill_color.\n- It built a cell map by (row, col), then for each cell generated edges in the four cardinal directions only when the neighbor exists and its fill_color != '0099FF'.\n- It wrote the resulting adjacency list to workspace/adjacency_cardinal.json and reported 180 nodes with 248 directed edges, matching expected filtering logic.\n\nNo further changes are required. The PLAN’s goals have been achieved. <END>",
