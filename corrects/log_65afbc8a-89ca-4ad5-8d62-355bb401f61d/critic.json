  "reason": "(1) Task decomposition: extract 20×9 grid from Excel, identify START (A1) and END (I20), mark blue obstacle cells, simulate exactly 11 turns of two-cell moves in cardinal directions without backward steps, avoid blue cells, and report the landing cell’s 6-digit hex fill color. Success criteria: correct grid parsing, accurate movement rule implementation, valid pathfinding, and precise hex code extraction. (2) Individual evaluations: Member 1 correctly generated two-cell adjacency and ran BFS but omitted explicit backward-move constraints beyond two-cell moves and did not validate path length or revisit logic, leading to an implausibly long 64-turn path and unverified color FFFF00. Member 2 provided detailed obstacle statistics but misinterpreted “no backward” as forbidding any return to previous cell across turns, prematurely declaring the puzzle unsolvable without path simulation. Member 3 thoroughly parsed the Excel structure, cataloged cell colors (including blue obstacles FF0099FF), implemented a stateful BFS respecting two-cell moves, last-direction no-backtracking, and obstacle avoidance, then traced the exact landing position after 11 turns (cell E3) and extracted its hex code ‘FFF478A7’ → ‘F478A7’. (3) Cross-analysis: only Member 3 fully satisfied all movement constraints, grid extraction requirements, and provided a detailed verification; Member 1 and Member 2 exhibited methodological gaps and unverified conclusions. (4) Synthesis: adopt Member 3’s complete approach and final result. (5) Validation: Member 3’s pathfinding was internally consistent, aligned with task rules, and hex code format matches specifications. (6) Confidence assessment: high — Member 3’s solution is the only one demonstrating full compliance with all problem constraints and robust verification.",
