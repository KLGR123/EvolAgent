  "reason": "Task analysis: Calculate total wheels for steam locomotives in a North American railroad museum collection from Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx. All three members successfully parsed the Excel file and identified 7 steam locomotives using Whyte notation patterns (dash-separated wheel configurations). Critical divergence identified: Members 1 and 3 calculated 60 total wheels by treating Whyte notation numbers as actual wheel counts (0-4-0 = 0+4+0 = 4 wheels), while Member 2 calculated 120 total wheels by treating each number as wheel pairs requiring multiplication by 2 (0-4-0 = (0+4+0)Ã—2 = 8 wheels). Resolution through railway engineering analysis: Whyte notation represents the number of wheels, not wheel pairs. The format front-driving-trailing directly indicates wheel counts, where 0-4-0 means 0 leading wheels + 4 driving wheels + 0 trailing wheels = 4 total wheels. Member 2's interpretation as wheel pairs is incorrect. Cross-verification: Members 1 and 3 provided identical detailed breakdowns: locomotive #1060 (0-4-0) = 4 wheels, #31 (0-4-0) = 4 wheels, #18 (4-4-0) = 8 wheels, #825 (2-6-0) = 8 wheels, #52 (2-8-0) = 10 wheels, #89 (2-6-4) = 12 wheels, #266 (2-8-4) = 14 wheels, totaling 4+4+8+8+10+12+14 = 60 wheels. Both members demonstrated superior understanding of locomotive wheel classification systems. Final validation confirms 60 wheels as the correct total.",
