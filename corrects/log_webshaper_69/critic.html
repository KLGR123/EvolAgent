                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                June 6, 1955<br><br>
                <strong>True Answer:</strong><br>
                1955<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task decomposition: The problem requires identifying (1) the musical group that recorded four specific songs in a three-day $1500 self-funded session, (2) which member of that group filled in as keyboardist for The_Family_(band), and (3) that person's birth date. All three members executed comprehensive research with systematic methodologies. Member 1 evaluation: Conducted 18 search queries across multiple engines, collected 263 results, definitively identified The Frogs as the recording band through official band sources including direct quote from Jimmy Flemion confirming the $1500/3-day session details. Successfully traced Dennis Flemion as the keyboardist replacement for The Family, and verified his birth date as June 6, 1955 through multiple authoritative sources (Wikipedia, RateYourMusic, SPCodex Wiki) with 100% consistency. Demonstrated excellent source verification and documentation practices. Member 2 evaluation: Executed parallel research with 8 targeted queries, identified The Frogs through comprehensive analysis, found the Dennis Flemion connection to The Family, and confirmed the same birth date (June 6, 1955) through independent source verification including NNDB, MusicBrainz, Find a Grave. Showed strong methodological rigor with detailed confidence assessment and evidence cross-referencing. Member 3 evaluation: Conducted focused research identifying The Frogs and the Prince connection, found explicit confirmation that 'Melvoin's replacement was Dennis Flemion of The Frogs' and verified biographical details including the birth date June 6, 1955. Convergence analysis: Perfect agreement across all members on (1) The Frogs as the recording band, (2) Dennis Flemion as the keyboardist replacement, (3) June 6, 1955 as the birth date. Multiple independent verification sources confirm accuracy. No contradictions identified. Final validation: The answer June 6, 1955 represents Dennis Flemion's birth date, confirmed through systematic research across multiple authoritative databases with complete consistency. Confidence level: Very High.
