# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_20  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-07 05:41:58

## Plan Content
```
Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify a composer whose musical piece requires orchestration with four separate brass ensembles and over 400 total performers. Search for keywords including 'composer four brass ensembles 400 performers', 'orchestral work four separate brass groups', 'large scale orchestration 400+ musicians four brass', and 'classical composer massive orchestration brass ensembles'. Focus on identifying composers known for extremely large-scale orchestral works that would require such extensive instrumentation and performer counts.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify a very specific composer based on unique orchestration requirements (four separate brass ensembles and 400+ performers), (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to determine which composer created such an unusually large-scale work, likely from the Romantic or late Romantic period, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to then search for the critical edition of their works and the specific editor who worked on both this composer and Bizet translations

### Development Step 3: Post-1977 20th-Century Malko Competition Winners: Names, Years, Nationalities (Including Defunct States)

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated compilation of Malko Competition winners by nationality for a musicology research paper on post-1977 European conductor trends
- Cultural heritage data enrichment in a digital library to tag and cross-reference 20th-century competition laureates
- Historical geopolitical analysis of USSR and Yugoslavian artists for a Cold War-era performing arts exhibition catalogue
- University curriculum development tool that aggregates real-world competition results to build case studies in conducting courses
- Classical music streaming platform feature that auto-generates artist profiles with competition wins and former-country origins
- Grant-writing support system for arts foundations, pre-filling applicant profiles with past prize data sorted by year and historical nationality
- Automated archival metadata creation for national music archives, extracting structured winner records from public web sources

### Development Step 4: Compile All Post-1977 Malko Competition Winners with Nationalities, Including Defunct Countries

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Archiving and trend analysis for music historians mapping post-1977 Malko Competition winners by nationality and geopolitical context
- Classical music database enrichment with automated extraction of winner names, years, and historical country tags for digital library platforms
- Academic research into Cold War–era cultural exchanges, using detailed Malko Competition data for musicology theses on geopolitical influences
- Museum exhibition curation displaying Malko Competition laureates from defunct states (USSR, Yugoslavia, etc.) to illustrate 20th-century political shifts
- Government cultural policy evaluation assessing how nation-state transformations impacted participation and success rates in international music contests
- University course material development, creating interactive timelines of Malko Competition winners tied to historical country changes for world history or music studies
- Record label marketing analytics identifying award-winning artists’ regional origins and historical backgrounds to drive targeted promotional campaigns

### Development Step 1: 20th Century Post-1977 Malko Competition Winners with Nationalities: Comprehensive Data Compilation

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic musicology research on post-1977 Malko Competition winners to analyze Cold War era nationality trends among laureates from former Soviet and Eastern Bloc states
- Digital library and archive curation workflows automating extraction and integration of Malko Competition winner metadata (names, years, defunct-country nationalities) into institutional catalogs
- Cultural policy assessment by government arts councils using historical winner data to evaluate the evolution of artistic support for musicians from now-dissolved states like Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia
- Museum and exhibition planning teams sourcing chronological recipient lists to create interactive displays on classical music heritage and geopolitical change from 1978 to 2000
- Music journalism and editorial projects compiling comprehensive timelines of Malko laureates for feature articles, anniversary retrospectives, and documentary scripts
- Library management system enhancements leveraging automated scraping routines to maintain up-to-date competition records and link laureate profiles across successor states of the former USSR
- Data journalism investigations visualizing shifts in international competition representation by mapping winner nationalities against historical state boundaries
- Grant evaluation committees benchmarking past competition winners’ trajectories by nationality to design equitable selection criteria for emerging classical musicians

    "description": 'Phase 1 implementation focusing on comprehensive web search to identify composers whose works require four separate brass ensembles and over 400 total performers. This approach combines Google search API (if available) with direct classical music database searches to systematically identify composer candidates. The code searches multiple specific queries, accesses classical music Wikipedia pages and databases, and analyzes content for mentions of large orchestrations, brass ensemble requirements, and performer counts. It saves all search results and analysis to workspace files for further investigation. Key features include: (1) Multi-query Google search using SerpAPI, (2) Direct access to classical music resources like Wikipedia orchestration lists, (3) Content analysis using regex patterns to identify composer names associated with large orchestrations, (4) Systematic saving of all findings for subsequent detailed analysis. This establishes the foundation for identifying the specific composer and work that matches the unusual instrumentation requirements.',

The **CURRENT CODE** was designed to search for composers requiring four brass ensembles and 400+ performers, but the actual output shows searches about 'Arlington National Cemetery Sheridan 1893 reburial ceremony' and Philip Sheridan memorial topics. This indicates either: (1) the wrong code was executed, (2) there's variable contamination from a previous unrelated search task, or (3) the search API is returning cached results from a different query.

This code completely clears all variables at the start and focuses exclusively on the composer search objective. Key improvements: (1) Explicit variable clearing to prevent contamination from previous searches, (2) Expanded search queries including specific known large-scale works by Mahler, Berlioz, and Stockhausen, (3) Increased rate limiting delays to avoid API errors, (4) Targeted Phase 4 addition focusing on composers historically known for massive orchestrations, (5) More robust error handling and content analysis. The code systematically searches for composers whose works require four separate brass ensembles and over 400 performers, saves all results to workspace files, and provides comprehensive analysis of findings. This approach should eliminate the previous contamination issue and deliver relevant composer identification results.',

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code ran but produced completely incorrect output for the composer search objective. The **CURRENT CODE** was designed to search for composers requiring four brass ensembles and 400+ performers, but the actual output shows searches about 'Arlington National Cemetery Sheridan 1893 reburial ceremony' and Philip Sheridan memorial topics instead of any musical or orchestral content. This indicates severe variable contamination or cached state from a previous unrelated historical research task. The search API returned 429 rate limit errors for all queries, and no composer names, orchestral works, or brass ensemble information was found. **PLAN** alignment: 0% complete - no progress toward identifying the target composer. The lengthy output contains valuable debugging information showing the contamination issue, so recommend saving this diagnostic output to 'workspace/contamination_debug_log.txt' for analysis. Immediate fix needed: (1) Clear all variables and restart with fresh session state, (2) Verify API key functionality and rate limits, (3) Add explicit variable initialization to prevent cross-task contamination, (4) Implement fallback search methods when API fails.",

    "description": 'Fresh session restart implementation addressing the severe contamination issue. This code completely clears the Python namespace, saves the contamination debug log for analysis, and starts with entirely fresh variables. Key features: (1) Explicit variable clearing and reinitialization to prevent contamination, (2) Bypasses rate-limited API and focuses on direct classical music database access, (3) Targets known large-scale orchestral works by Mahler, Berlioz, Stockhausen, and Ives, (4) Implements comprehensive content analysis with brass ensemble pattern matching, (5) Calculates relevance scores for composer candidates, (6) Saves all results to fresh workspace files. The approach systematically searches classical music Wikipedia pages, analyzes content for brass ensemble mentions and large performer counts, and identifies the most promising composer candidates. This should eliminate the contamination issue and deliver relevant results for the composer search objective.',

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code ran but produced completely incorrect output. The **CURRENT CODE** was designed to search for composers requiring four brass ensembles and 400+ performers, but the actual output shows searches about 'Colorado Avalanche complaint Bertuzzi hit Moore' and 'NHL disciplinary changes 2004 Bertuzzi case' instead of any musical content. This indicates severe variable contamination from a previous hockey-related search task. The search API returned 429 rate limit errors ('Your account has run out of searches') for most queries, preventing any meaningful composer research. **PLAN** alignment: 0% complete - no composer names, orchestral works, or brass ensemble information was found. The code did successfully access some classical music Wikipedia pages (Symphony No. 8 Mahler, Requiem Berlioz, etc.) and saved HTML files to workspace, which shows the direct database search approach was working correctly. Immediate fixes needed: (1) Completely clear all cached variables and API state from previous tasks, (2) Address the API rate limit issue - either wait for reset or implement alternative search methods, (3) Focus on analyzing the successfully downloaded classical music content from Wikipedia pages that were already saved to workspace files, as these contain the actual relevant data for identifying the target composer.",

This approach bypasses the problematic search APIs entirely and works with the HTML files already saved to workspace. Key features: (1) Systematic analysis of all downloaded HTML files for classical music content, (2) Comprehensive pattern matching for brass ensemble mentions, large performer counts, and orchestration details, (3) Relevance scoring system to rank composer candidates, (4) Special identification of works meeting the 400+ performer and multiple brass ensemble criteria, (5) Extraction of specific composer names, work titles, and instrumentation details. The code analyzes content from known large-scale works like Mahler's Symphony No. 8, Berlioz's Requiem, and Stockhausen's compositions to identify which composer and work most closely matches the unusual requirements of four separate brass ensembles and over 400 total performers.",

The analysis processed 6 HTML files from Wikipedia pages about classical composers and their works, extracting relevant information about brass ensembles and performer counts. **TOP CANDIDATE IDENTIFIED**: Hector Berlioz's Requiem, which meets both key requirements: ✓ 400+ performers (up to 800 performers mentioned), ✓ Multiple brass group indicators (5 brass group patterns found including 'four brass ensemble' and 'four brass choir'). The code successfully calculated relevance scores, identified orchestration details, and saved comprehensive analysis results to 'workspace/classical_music_analysis_results.json'. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the objective to find a composer whose work requires 4 separate brass ensembles and 400+ total performers has been achieved.
