**Task ID:** 87c610df-bef7-4932-b950-1d83ef4e282b  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-30 17:35:32

## Plan Content
```
Research who was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977. Search for historical information about India's political leadership during that specific month, focusing on identifying the individual who held the Prime Minister position at that time.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal next step because: (1) We've successfully identified 'India' as the first place mentioned by name in the Book of Esther NIV translation from the previous research, (2) The HISTORY shows definitive confirmation that India appears first in Esther 1:1 within the context of King Xerxes' empire, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific individual who served as India's Prime Minister in April 1977, (4) This directly completes the TASK by finding the Prime Minister of the identified location during the specified time period.

    "description": "This code implements a comprehensive research approach to identify India's Prime Minister in April 1977. The implementation follows a multi-layered strategy: (1) Searches Wikipedia for the official list of Indian Prime Ministers to find tenure information around 1977, (2) Looks for specific information about April 1977 in relevant Wikipedia articles about The Emergency period, 1977 elections, and key political figures, (3) Provides well-documented historical facts as a reliable fallback. The research focuses on the transition period from Indira Gandhi's Emergency rule to Morarji Desai's Janata Party government. Based on historical records, the 1977 general election was held in March 1977, Janata Party won, and Morarji Desai was sworn in as Prime Minister on March 24, 1977, making him the Prime Minister during April 1977. The code saves all research findings to 'workspace/india_pm_april_1977_research.json' and provides a clear conclusion with supporting evidence.",

The **CURRENT CODE** was supposed to research India's Prime Minister in April 1977, but the actual output shows it's searching for American Alligator occurrences west of Texas from USGS databases. This suggests either a code execution error or the wrong code was run. The output contains no information about Indian Prime Ministers, April 1977, Morarji Desai, or any related historical data. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - completely different research topic executed.

    "description": "This implementation provides a comprehensive research approach to definitively answer who was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977. The code addresses the previous execution error by implementing a fresh, focused research strategy that: (1) Provides well-documented historical facts about the 1977 Indian political transition, including the Emergency period timeline, election dates, and government transition, (2) Attempts to verify information through Wikipedia sources about Morarji Desai, the 1977 election, and the Emergency period, (3) Compiles a complete timeline showing that Morarji Desai was sworn in as Prime Minister on March 24, 1977, making him the Prime Minister during April 1977. The research conclusively shows that Morarji Desai of the Janata Party was India's Prime Minister in April 1977, following the end of Indira Gandhi's Emergency period and the Janata Party's electoral victory in March 1977. Results are saved to both a detailed JSON file and a summary text file in the workspace directory.",

The script successfully researched and identified that Morarji Desai was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977. The code fetched relevant information from multiple Wikipedia sources, provided comprehensive historical context about the Emergency period (1975-1977), the 1977 general election, and the political transition from Indira Gandhi to Morarji Desai. The output clearly states the answer with supporting evidence: Morarji Desai was sworn in as Prime Minister on March 24, 1977, making him the serving Prime Minister during April 1977. The research results were saved to both JSON and text files in the workspace directory for future reference. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the historical research objective has been fully achieved with high confidence based on well-documented sources.
