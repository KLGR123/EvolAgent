                Cambridge University Press<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task analysis: Identify the publisher that reissued in 2009 a co-authored book from 1851 that advocated atheistic naturalism, systematically explored phrenology and mesmerism, and was controversial. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted systematic research identifying 'Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development' by Harriet Martineau and Henry George Atkinson (1851) as the target work, with comprehensive verification of all criteria - co-authored correspondence, atheistic naturalism advocacy, systematic phrenology/mesmerism exploration, controversial reception damaging Martineau's reputation. Definitively identified Cambridge University Press as 2009 reissuer through workspace analysis of 57 files with strong evidence (20 mentions from comprehensive sources). Member 2 followed similar methodology, initially identifying the same Martineau-Atkinson work and Cambridge University Press through systematic web searches and academic database analysis, with multiple bibliographic confirmations. Member 3 identified 'Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation' by Robert Chambers, but acknowledged this was single-authored (not co-authored), failing the fundamental co-authorship requirement, concluding University of Chicago Press as 2009 reissuer. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on both book identification and publisher, while Member 3 identified a different work that doesn't meet the co-authorship criterion. Contradiction resolution: The Martineau-Atkinson correspondence represents genuine collaborative authorship through epistolary format, while Chambers' anonymous publication doesn't constitute co-authorship. Synthesis evaluation: Members 1 and 2 demonstrate superior methodological rigor by correctly identifying the co-authored requirement and providing consistent bibliographic evidence for Cambridge University Press. Final validation confirms 'Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development' perfectly matches all criteria with Cambridge University Press as the verified 2009 reissuer.
