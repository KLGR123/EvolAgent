# Developer Plan #2 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 99c9cc74-fdc8-46c6-8f8d-3ce2d3bfeea3  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 01:56:13

## Plan Content
```
Parse the file workspace/strawberry_pie_filling_recipe.txt to extract all ingredient names mentioned for the strawberry pie filling, remove any measurement words and duplicates, sort the ingredient names alphabetically, and output them as a single comma-separated list.
```

## Plan Description
```
This plan is optimal because: (1) The transcription file workspace/strawberry_pie_filling_recipe.txt contains the raw recipe text needed to identify the ingredients, (2) No ingredient extraction has been performed yet, (3) The developer will produce the exact comma-separated, alphabetized list of ingredients without measurements as requested, (4) This directly completes the core TASK of listing the filling ingredients.
```

    "feedback": 'Execution failed - The code ran without errors but produced a single long string instead of discrete ingredient names. Because the recipe is one free-text line (no explicit commas or numeric measurements except the word “dash”), the current logic treated the entire sentence as one ingredient. Plan alignment: 0% - no individual ingredients were extracted, deduplicated, or sorted.\n\nMain issue: The parsing assumes each ingredient is on its own line or marked by numbers/units. In this recipe, ingredients are listed inline between “combine” and “cook,” so the code never splits them into separate items.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Extract the substring between “combine ” and “ cook” to isolate the ingredient list.\n2. Split that substring into individual ingredients using delimiters such as commas and the word “ and ”.\n3. For each split item, apply your existing cleanup steps (remove measurement words, parentheses, extra whitespace).\n4. Collect, dedupe, sort alphabetically, and then join with commas.\n\nImplementing these adjustments will allow the code to pull out: cornstarch, fresh squeezed lemon juice, granulated sugar, pure vanilla extract, ripe strawberries as intended.',

    "feedback": 'Partial success – The code runs without errors and isolates the “combine”/“stir in” segments, applies cleaning (removing numbers, units, punctuation, articles), dedupes, sorts, and writes the output. However, the first segment still produces a single run-on token “ripe strawberries granulated sugar freshly squeezed lemon juice” instead of three separate ingredients.\n\nPlan alignment: ~60% complete. You need to split that run-on token into:\n  • ripe strawberries\n  • granulated sugar\n  • fresh squeezed lemon juice\n\nNext steps:\n1. When you split segment1 on commas and ‘and’, check if you still have only one long token (e.g. `len(raw_tokens)==1` or any token has >3 words).\n2. If so, fall back to a regex that pulls out 2–3 word noun phrases, for example:\n   ```python\n   tokens = re.split(r"\\band\\b|,", segment1)\n   if len(tokens)==1:\n       tokens = re.findall(r"\\b[a-z]+(?: [a-z]+){1,2}\\b", segment1)\n   ```\n3. Pass each of these `tokens` through your existing `clean_token()` function.\n4. Continue with dedupe, alphabetical sort, and comma-join for the final list.\n\nWith this change you should extract exactly: cornstarch, fresh squeezed lemon juice, granulated sugar, pure vanilla extract, ripe strawberries.
