# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 99c9cc74-fdc8-46c6-8f8d-3ce2d3bfeea3  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 02:02:15

## Plan Content
```
Analyze the attached audio file data/gaia/2023/validation/99c9cc74-fdc8-46c6-8f8d-3ce2d3bfeea3.mp3 to extract the strawberry pie filling recipe from Aditi's voice memo. Extract all ingredients mentioned for the filling only (not crust ingredients), identify each ingredient without measurements or quantities, and prepare the data for alphabetizing and formatting as a comma-separated list.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to process the audio file to understand what ingredients Aditi mentioned in her voice memo, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this audio file, (3) Expected outcome is to have a clear understanding of all filling ingredients mentioned in the recipe, (4) This provides the foundation needed to create the alphabetized comma-separated list as requested in the TASK
