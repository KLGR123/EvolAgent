Dustin Nguyen specializes exclusively in children's Batman comics with watercolor art and family-friendly themes - the complete opposite of the dark, post-apocalyptic Peter Pan reimagining described.\n\n**POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS:**\n1. The series is misattributed to Dustin Nguyen\n2. The series does not exist and may be fictional\n3. The series is by a different artist entirely\n4.
