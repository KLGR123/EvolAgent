## Final Answer
```
Maktay Mato Apple
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Translate 'I like apples' into Tizin using specific grammatical rules including VOS word order, case declensions, and semantic role reversal for the verb 'Maktay'. All three members demonstrated excellent linguistic analysis and reached identical conclusions through systematic application of the provided grammar rules. Member 1 provided clear step-by-step analysis identifying the key transformation where 'Maktay' functions as 'is pleasing to', requiring the experiencer (I) to take accusative case 'Mato' as the object, while the stimulus (apples) takes nominative case 'Apple' as the subject. Member 2 reinforced this analysis with explicit acknowledgment of the semantic reversal and included the literal translation 'is pleasing to me apples' for clarity. Member 3 provided comprehensive linguistic reasoning, clearly explaining the VOS structure and the conceptual shift from 'I like apples' to 'Apples are pleasing to me'. Convergence analysis shows perfect agreement across all members on grammatical application, case usage, and final translation. Cross-validation confirms: (1) Correct verb form 'Maktay' for present tense, (2) Proper accusative case 'Mato' for the experiencer as object, (3) Correct nominative case 'Apple' for the stimulus as subject, (4) Accurate VOS word order implementation. All members demonstrated strong understanding of the non-intuitive semantic role assignment inherent in the Tizin verb system. Final answer validation: 'Maktay Mato Apple' correctly represents 'Apples are pleasing to me' following all specified grammatical constraints.
