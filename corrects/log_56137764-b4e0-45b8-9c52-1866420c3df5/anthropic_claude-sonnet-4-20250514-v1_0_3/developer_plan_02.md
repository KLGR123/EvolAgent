# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Research the contributors to OpenCV's Mask-RCNN implementation (specifically Dmitry Kurtaev and other identified contributors from the August 2018 implementation) and cross-reference their names with former Chinese heads of government when transliterated to the Latin alphabet. Focus on identifying if any contributor names match transliterated names of Chinese premiers, presidents, or other government leaders throughout Chinese history, including both modern and historical figures from various Chinese dynasties and political periods.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The previous research successfully identified that Mask-RCNN support was added to OpenCV on August 24, 2018, with Dmitry Kurtaev as the primary implementer and other contributors involved, (2) We now need to examine the contributor names and compare them with transliterated names of former Chinese heads of government, (3) Expected outcome is to identify which contributor's name matches a former Chinese leader's name when both are in Latin alphabet transliteration, (4) This will provide the final answer to the TASK question about the name match between OpenCV contributors and Chinese government leaders

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 20: Find Tahir Yuldashev’s co-founded Islamic organization and the 1992 crackdown perpetrators

**Description**: Search for information about Tahir Yuldashev's biographical details, focusing on identifying the organization he co-founded and the specific group or leader who conducted the 1992 crackdown against this organization. Look for details about his role as a former Soviet paratrooper, the Islamic organization he helped establish, and which government forces, military units, or leaders were responsible for the crackdown that forced him to flee in 1992.

**Use Cases**:
- Political risk assessment for an international security consultancy, automatically extracting extremist leaders’ organizational affiliations and crackdown timelines from archived search result JSON files
- Investigative journalism background verification, consolidating founders’ biographical details, military service records, and government response events from web search snippets
- Academic research in Central Asian history, automating the reconstruction of political movement timelines by parsing biographical data from multiple search result dumps
- Compliance screening in a global bank, programmatically identifying potential sanctions risks by extracting individual affiliations and past government crackdowns from open-source search archives
- Corporate due diligence in mergers and acquisitions, building candidate and executive background profiles by analyzing historic search data for military service and leadership roles
- NGO partner vetting and security risk management, evaluating affiliations of potential collaborators through deep inspection of search-engine result metadata
- Counterterrorism intelligence operations, synthesizing open-source search snippets into structured profiles of militant group founders and their interactions with state actors
- Digital humanities archiving, enriching metadata for political figure collections by extracting verified biographical facts from legacy search result JSON datasets

### Development Step 6: Identify the Prime Minister of India in April 1977 using reputable historical sources

**Description**: Research who was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977. Use reputable historical sources to identify the political leadership of India during this specific time period. Focus on determining who held the position of Prime Minister in India following any elections, transitions, or political events that occurred in or before April 1977.

**Use Cases**:
- Journalism fact-checking and contextual timeline generation for articles on India’s 1977 political transition
- Political risk assessment in financial services to verify leadership during sanction or investment analysis periods
- EdTech platforms automatically creating interactive history modules and quizzes about Indian prime ministers
- AI-powered virtual assistants retrieving reliable historical leadership data in response to user queries
- Academic research workflows automating verification of officeholder dates for political science publications
- Digital archive and knowledge graph population with metadata on prime ministerial terms and transitions
- Documentary production scripting tools pulling precise leadership timelines for narrative development
- Government open-data portals providing API-backed historical leadership information for public and researchers

### Development Step 22: Research Tahir Yuldashev: Ex-Soviet Paratrooper, Islamic Organization Co-Founder, and 1992 Crackdown Authorities

**Description**: Search for information about Tahir Yuldashev's biographical details, focusing on identifying the organization he co-founded and the specific group or leader who conducted the 1992 crackdown against this organization. Look for details about his role as a former Soviet paratrooper, the Islamic organization he helped establish, and which government forces, military units, or leaders were responsible for the crackdown that forced him to flee in 1992.

**Use Cases**:
- Investigative journalism biographical fact-checking and organizational affiliation verification for political profiles
- Corporate compliance KYC screening and adverse media monitoring for high-risk client onboarding
- Academic historical research timeline extraction of Soviet-era movements and state crackdowns for publications
- Cyber threat intelligence enrichment on extremist group founders and government repression events from open sources
- Legal eDiscovery public profile aggregation of corporate defendants’ military backgrounds and association with contested organizations
- NGO field security risk assessments by profiling local contacts’ past organizational ties and forced migration incidents
- Venture capital founder due diligence automation gathering military service history, co-founded ventures, and persecution timelines
- Public relations reputation monitoring of executives’ online biographies to detect inaccuracies, past crackdowns, and organizational links

### Development Step 5: Identify India’s Prime Minister in April 1977 Using Reputable Historical Sources

**Description**: Research who was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977. Use reputable historical sources to identify the political leadership of India during this specific time period. Focus on determining who held the position of Prime Minister in India following any elections, transitions, or political events that occurred in or before April 1977.

**Use Cases**:
- Curriculum development for history educators to automatically fetch and verify the Prime Minister of India during specific periods, ensuring lesson plans reflect accurate leadership timelines
- Political science research platform integrating automated date-based queries to analyze the impact of leadership changes (e.g., comparing policy shifts before and after April 1977)
- Newsroom fact-checking tool that pulls verified archival data on heads of government for contextual reporting on historical articles or anniversary stories
- Government archives digitization project that scripts bulk extraction of ministerial tenures into JSON, enabling searchable databases of leadership transitions
- Museum interactive kiosk software that provides visitors with on-demand historical profiles of world leaders, including Indian Prime Ministers by month and year
- Policy think tank dashboard aggregating term-start and end dates of national leaders to correlate economic indicators with political regimes
- Historical timeline visualization service for documentary filmmakers to plot precise dates of officeholders, such as identifying the first non-Congress Prime Minister in April 1977
