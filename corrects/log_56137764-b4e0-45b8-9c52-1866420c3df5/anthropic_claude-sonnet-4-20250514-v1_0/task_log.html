The comprehensive web search and analysis have successfully identified China\&#x27;s significant economic event in 1997. Based on the thorough analysis of 96 search results from multiple search engines, the findings are conclusive:\n\n**PRIMARY FINDING**: The significant economic event that China faced in 1997 was the **ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS**.\n\n**KEY EVIDENCE**:\n1. **Highest-scoring result (8/10)** from Indonesia\&#x27;s Finance Ministry document confirms: &quot;Massive infrastructure investment in China began especially after 1997 crisis where Chinese Government pushed out a stimulus plan to maintain post-crisis economic growth.&quot;\n\n2. **28 search results** specifically mentioned the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, establishing clear historical context.\n\n3. **Crisis Timeline**: The crisis began in Thailand in July 1997 when the Thai baht was floated, then spread across Asia affecting multiple economies.\n\n4. **China\&#x27;s Response**: Unlike many Asian neighbors, China was relatively protected due to its closed capital account and fixed exchange rate, but still implemented infrastructure investment and stimulus measures to maintain economic growth.\n\n**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**: The specific &quot;287 billion yuan&quot; figure mentioned in the PLAN appears to be from more recent Chinese infrastructure projects (found 4 mentions of this amount in contemporary contexts), not from 1997. However, the core research objective has been achieved - the 1997 economic event that prompted China\&#x27;s major construction and infrastructure investments was definitively identified as the Asian Financial Crisis.\n\n**FILES CREATED**:\n- `workspace/china_1997_economic_event_search_results.json`: Complete search results from 8 comprehensive queries across multiple search engines\n- `workspace/china_1997_economic_event_analysis.json`: Detailed analysis summary with categorized findings and conclusions\n\nThe PLAN has been fully executed and the research question answered with high confidence based on extensive web search evidence.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted by the developer, the significant economic event that China faced in 1997 has been definitively identified as the Asian Financial Crisis. The research analyzed 96 search results and found conclusive evidence that: (1) The Asian Financial Crisis began in July 1997 when Thailand floated the Thai baht and spread across Asia, (2) China responded with infrastructure investment and stimulus measures to maintain economic growth during this crisis period, (3) Multiple authoritative sources confirmed that China&#x27;s massive infrastructure investments began especially after the 1997 crisis as part of a government stimulus plan. While the specific 287 billion yuan figure appears to reference more recent projects, the core economic event of 1997 that prompted China&#x27;s major construction project allocations was clearly the Asian Financial Crisis. Final answer: Asian Financial Crisis.&quot;,<br>}<br>```</p>

<p>Description: This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific OpenCV version that first introduced Mask-RCNN support to narrow our search scope, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to determine which OpenCV release added Mask-RCNN functionality and identify the development team or contributors involved, (4) This directly targets the first part of the TASK requirement to find contributors to the Mask-RCNN implementation in OpenCV</p>
<p>Episodic Examples:<br>### Development Step 7: Identify oldest closed numpy.polynomial &#x27;Regression&#x27; issue and its creation, closure, and label-add dates</p>
<p>**Description**: Search GitHub for numpy.polynomial issues to identify all closed issues that have the &#x27;Regression&#x27; label. Focus on finding the oldest closed issue with this label and determine when the &#x27;Regression&#x27; label was added to that specific issue. Use GitHub&#x27;s issue search functionality with filters for repository &#x27;numpy/numpy&#x27;, path &#x27;polynomial&#x27;, status &#x27;closed&#x27;, and label &#x27;Regression&#x27;. Extract the issue creation date, closure date, and label addition timestamp for the oldest matching issue.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Open source maintainers integrating automated GitHub API scripts to detect when the ‘Regression’ label is added to numpy.polynomial issues, ensuring timely backporting into long-term support (LTS) releases<br>- A data science research team auditing the stability of polynomial fitting methods by retrieving creation, closure, and regression label timestamps from numpy issues, supporting reproducibility in scientific publications<br>- DevOps engineers scheduling nightly CI jobs to flag newly closed numpy.polynomial regression issues and post alerts in Slack, accelerating triage for critical numerical library defects<br>- QA managers generating custom dashboards of closed regression issues in numpy.polynomial, measuring average time from issue creation to label application to improve testing SLAs<br>- Software architects analyzing historical labeling trends in numpy.polynomial to prioritize targeted refactoring and reduce future regression risk in core numerical modules<br>- Compliance auditors extracting detailed issue timelines for numpy.polynomial regressions to demonstrate adherence to internal defect management policies during software quality audits<br>- Community coordinators organizing focused bug-fix sprints by identifying the oldest labeled regression issues in numpy.polynomial, streamlining contributor efforts during open-source weekends<br>- Product owners tracking regression‐related issue resolution metrics in numpy.polynomial to inform roadmap decisions for feature deprecation and API stabilization</p>

<p>**Description**: Search GitHub for numpy.polynomial issues to identify all closed issues that have the &#x27;Regression&#x27; label. Focus on finding the oldest closed issue with this label and determine when the &#x27;Regression&#x27; label was added to that specific issue. Use GitHub&#x27;s issue search functionality with filters for repository &#x27;numpy/numpy&#x27;, path &#x27;polynomial&#x27;, status &#x27;closed&#x27;, and label &#x27;Regression&#x27;. Extract the issue creation date, closure date, and label addition timestamp for the oldest matching issue.</p>

The script identified the earliest Mask-RCNN commit from August 24, 2018, authored by Dmitry Kurtaev, and found 8 unique commits plus 30 related issues. Key finding: Mask-RCNN support was first introduced via pull request #12243 on 2018-08-24. The code also retrieved 66 OpenCV releases for version correlation. However, the **PLAN** requires deeper analysis to identify the specific OpenCV version and extract all contributor names. Current **PLAN** alignment: 40% - good foundation established but needs follow-up analysis of the identified commits, pull requests, and release correlation. The comprehensive output has been saved to workspace. Next steps: (1) Analyze the specific pull request #12243 for detailed contributor information, (2) Correlate the August 2018 commit date with OpenCV release versions, (3) Extract commit details from the identified SHA to get complete contributor list.</p></div>

The script successfully loaded and inspected the 429KB JSON file containing comprehensive Mask-RCNN research results. Key findings confirmed: (1) First Mask-RCNN commit identified as SHA 472b71eceff52681222834545d85c36c7227f977 from August 24, 2018, authored by Dmitry Kurtaev and committed by Alexander Alekhin, (2) Associated with pull request #12243, (3) 8 unique commits and 30 issues found total. The code provides excellent preparation for the next phase by clearly identifying the critical commit SHA, pull request number, and timeline. **PLAN** alignment: 60% - solid progress made in identifying when and by whom Mask-RCNN was introduced, but still needs detailed contributor extraction from the specific pull request and commit analysis. Next step: Implement GitHub API calls to fetch detailed information about pull request #12243 and the specific commit to extract all contributors who worked on implementing Mask-RCNN support in OpenCV.</p></div>

                <div class="content-text"><p>Partial execution with critical error - Code started successfully and made good progress analyzing pull request #12243, retrieving basic PR details and identifying OpenCV version 3.4.3 as the likely first version with Mask-RCNN support (published August 29, 2018, 5 days after the commit). However, execution failed with a KeyError exception when trying to access the &#x27;name&#x27; field from user data, preventing extraction of detailed contributor information from commits and reviews. **PLAN** alignment: 70% - successfully identified the specific OpenCV version (3.4.3) and timeframe, but failed to extract the complete list of contributors as required. The comprehensive analysis file was saved but is incomplete due to the error. Next step: Fix the KeyError by adding proper null checks when accessing user &#x27;name&#x27; fields (use .get(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;N/A&#x27;) instead of direct access), then re-run to complete the contributor extraction from PR #12243 commits and reviews.</p></div>

                <div class="content-text"><p>Execution failed with KeyError - Code started well and successfully identified key information including OpenCV version 3.4.3 as the first version with Mask-RCNN support (published August 29, 2018). However, the execution failed with a KeyError exception when trying to access the &#x27;name&#x27; field from user data in the pull request analysis. This prevented the code from extracting the critical contributor information that the **PLAN** specifically requires. **PLAN** alignment: 70% - good progress on version identification but failed to extract the complete list of contributors. The error occurred because GitHub API user objects can have null &#x27;name&#x27; fields, requiring safe access patterns. Immediate fix needed: Replace direct dictionary access like user[&#x27;name&#x27;] with safe access using user.get(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;N/A&#x27;) or user.get(&#x27;name&#x27;) or &#x27;N/A&#x27; to handle missing name fields. Once fixed, the code should successfully extract all contributors from PR #12243 commits and reviews to complete the **PLAN** objectives.</p></div>

The script effectively extracted comprehensive contributor information from OpenCV Mask-RCNN implementation with proper error handling. Key achievements: (1) Successfully identified that Mask-RCNN support was first introduced in OpenCV version 3.4.3, released August 29, 2018, just 5 days after the commit, (2) Extracted complete contributor list from PR #12243 including commit authors, committers, reviewers, PR author (dkurt), and merger (alalek), (3) Identified all contributors: Dmitry Kurtaev as primary implementer, Alexander Alekhin as merger, and mshabunin as reviewer/assignee, (4) Provided detailed implementation statistics showing 2 commits, 9 files changed, +600/-153 lines, and 5 code reviews, (5) Saved comprehensive analysis to workspace file for future reference. The **PLAN** objective has been 100% achieved - the code successfully identified when Mask-RCNN model support was first added to OpenCV (version 3.4.3, August 2018) and extracted the names of all contributors who worked on implementing this functionality. No further development is needed.</p></div>

This implementation searches GitHub&#x27;s API using multiple strategies to find Mask-RCNN related commits and issues in the opencv/opencv repository. The approach includes: (1) Comprehensive search using different naming variants (Mask-RCNN, Mask R-CNN, MaskRCNN) to capture all possible references, (2) Systematic collection of both commits and issues sorted chronologically to identify the earliest introduction, (3) OpenCV release information gathering to correlate commit dates with specific versions, (4) Detailed analysis and storage of results for further investigation. The code uses extensive print statements to track progress and findings, saves comprehensive results to workspace/opencv_maskrcnn_research.json for subsequent analysis, and prepares the foundation for deeper investigation into contributors and implementation details. This establishes the baseline data needed to identify the specific OpenCV version that introduced Mask-RCNN support and the development team involved.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &#x27;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed the initial phase of the **PLAN** research. The script identified the earliest Mask-RCNN commit from August 24, 2018, authored by Dmitry Kurtaev, and found 8 unique commits plus 30 related issues. Key finding: Mask-RCNN support was first introduced via pull request #12243 on 2018-08-24. The code also retrieved 66 OpenCV releases for version correlation. However, the **PLAN** requires deeper analysis to identify the specific OpenCV version and extract all contributor names. Current **PLAN** alignment: 40% - good foundation established but needs follow-up analysis of the identified commits, pull requests, and release correlation. The comprehensive output has been saved to workspace. Next steps: (1) Analyze the specific pull request #12243 for detailed contributor information, (2) Correlate the August 2018 commit date with OpenCV release versions, (3) Extract commit details from the identified SHA to get complete contributor list.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &#x27;Code Output: \n\n=== OPENCV MASK-RCNN VERSION HISTORY RESEARCH ===\n\nObjective: Find when Mask-RCNN support was first added to OpenCV\nFocus: Identify specific version, contributors, and development team\n\nUsing workspace directory: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5\n\nRepository: opencv/opencv\n\n=== STEP 1: SEARCHING FOR MASK-RCNN RELATED CONTENT ===\n\n--- MASK-RCNN COMMITS ---\nQuery: repo:opencv/opencv Mask-RCNN\nMaking API request...\nStatus: SUCCESS\nTotal found: 6\nRetrieved: 6\n\nSample results:\n  1.

This implementation: (1) Safely inspects the JSON file structure to understand the data organization, (2) Extracts and analyzes the earliest commits and issues to identify the primary Mask-RCNN introduction point, (3) Identifies the critical commit (SHA: 472b71eceff52681222834545d85c36c7227f977) from August 24, 2018, by Dmitry Kurtaev, (4) Extracts the associated pull request number (#12243) for detailed analysis, (5) Prepares the foundation for the next phase which will involve analyzing the specific pull request and correlating the commit date with OpenCV release versions. This systematic approach ensures we understand our existing data before proceeding to extract all contributors involved in the Mask-RCNN implementation, advancing the PLAN toward identifying the specific OpenCV version and complete development team.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &#x27;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and effectively analyzed the previously saved research data. The script successfully loaded and inspected the 429KB JSON file containing comprehensive Mask-RCNN research results. Key findings confirmed: (1) First Mask-RCNN commit identified as SHA 472b71eceff52681222834545d85c36c7227f977 from August 24, 2018, authored by Dmitry Kurtaev and committed by Alexander Alekhin, (2) Associated with pull request #12243, (3) 8 unique commits and 30 issues found total. The code provides excellent preparation for the next phase by clearly identifying the critical commit SHA, pull request number, and timeline. **PLAN** alignment: 60% - solid progress made in identifying when and by whom Mask-RCNN was introduced, but still needs detailed contributor extraction from the specific pull request and commit analysis. Next step: Implement GitHub API calls to fetch detailed information about pull request #12243 and the specific commit to extract all contributors who worked on implementing Mask-RCNN support in OpenCV.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &quot;Code Output: \n\n=== INSPECTING OPENCV MASK-RCNN RESEARCH DATA ===\n\nObjective: Analyze saved research data and prepare for detailed commit analysis\nFocus: Understanding file structure before proceeding with contributor extraction\n\nUsing workspace directory: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5\nResearch file: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5/opencv_maskrcnn_research.json\nFile size: 429,420 bytes\n\n=== JSON FILE STRUCTURE INSPECTION ===\n\nTop-level keys:\n  research_timestamp: 2025-08-14T05:22:57.801436\n  repository: opencv/opencv\n  search_strategies: List with 4 items\n  search_results: Dictionary with 4 keys\n  analysis: Dictionary with 4 keys\n    Analysis sub-keys: [&#x27;total_unique_commits&#x27;, &#x27;total_unique_issues&#x27;, &#x27;earliest_commits&#x27;, &#x27;earliest_issues&#x27;]\n  releases_found: 66\n  next_steps: List with 4 items\n\n=== KEY FINDINGS FROM PREVIOUS RESEARCH ===\n\nTotal unique commits found: 8\nTotal unique issues found: 30\n\n=== EARLIEST COMMITS ANALYSIS ===\n\n1.

This implementation: (1) Fetches detailed information about pull request #12243 that introduced Mask-RCNN support, including author, merger, assignees, and statistics, (2) Retrieves all commits within the PR to identify every contributor who worked on the implementation, (3) Analyzes PR reviews and reviewers to capture the complete development team involvement, (4) Correlates the August 24, 2018 commit date with OpenCV release versions to identify which version first included Mask-RCNN support, (5) Compiles comprehensive contributor information including commit authors, committers, reviewers, and PR participants. The code systematically extracts all names involved in the Mask-RCNN implementation process, correlates timing with OpenCV versions, and provides detailed statistics about the implementation scope. Results are saved to workspace for complete documentation of when Mask-RCNN was added and who contributed to its development, fully addressing the PLAN objectives.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Partial execution with critical error - Code started successfully and made good progress analyzing pull request #12243, retrieving basic PR details and identifying OpenCV version 3.4.3 as the likely first version with Mask-RCNN support (published August 29, 2018, 5 days after the commit). However, execution failed with a KeyError exception when trying to access the &#x27;name&#x27; field from user data, preventing extraction of detailed contributor information from commits and reviews. **PLAN** alignment: 70% - successfully identified the specific OpenCV version (3.4.3) and timeframe, but failed to extract the complete list of contributors as required. The comprehensive analysis file was saved but is incomplete due to the error. Next step: Fix the KeyError by adding proper null checks when accessing user &#x27;name&#x27; fields (use .get(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;N/A&#x27;) instead of direct access), then re-run to complete the contributor extraction from PR #12243 commits and reviews.&quot;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &quot;Code Output: \n\n=== DETAILED OPENCV MASK-RCNN CONTRIBUTOR ANALYSIS ===\n\nObjective: Extract

extract all contributors. This implementation addresses the previous KeyError issues by: (1) Using safe dictionary access with .get() methods and proper None value handling throughout, (2) Implementing comprehensive error handling for all API calls to prevent execution failures, (3) Successfully extracting detailed information from PR #12243 including all commits, reviews, and contributor data, (4) Enriching contributor information with GitHub user profiles including company and location data, (5) Providing complete timeline correlation showing Mask-RCNN was first introduced in OpenCV 3.4.3 on August 29, 2018. The code systematically identifies and documents every person involved in the Mask-RCNN implementation: commit authors, committers, code reviewers, PR author, and merger. Results are comprehensively saved and presented, fully satisfying the PLAN requirements to identify when Mask-RCNN support was added to OpenCV and extract all contributor names from the development team.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution failed with KeyError - Code started well and successfully identified key information including OpenCV version 3.4.3 as the first version with Mask-RCNN support (published August 29, 2018). However, the execution failed with a KeyError exception when trying to access the &#x27;name&#x27; field from user data in the pull request analysis. This prevented the code from extracting the critical contributor information that the **PLAN** specifically requires. **PLAN** alignment: 70% - good progress on version identification but failed to extract the complete list of contributors. The error occurred because GitHub API user objects can have null &#x27;name&#x27; fields, requiring safe access patterns. Immediate fix needed: Replace direct dictionary access like user[&#x27;name&#x27;] with safe access using user.get(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;N/A&#x27;) or user.get(&#x27;name&#x27;) or &#x27;N/A&#x27; to handle missing name fields.

This final implementation addresses all previous KeyError issues by: (1) Implementing a safe_get() helper function that handles nested dictionary access with proper fallbacks for None values, (2) Using comprehensive try-catch blocks around all API calls to prevent execution failures, (3) Systematically extracting information from PR #12243 including all commits, reviews, author, merger, and assignees, (4) Providing detailed analysis of the implementation timeline showing Mask-RCNN was first introduced in OpenCV 3.4.3 on August 29, 2018, just 5 days after the commit, (5) Compiling a complete list of all contributors including commit authors, committers, code reviewers, PR author, and merger. The code uses extensive error handling and safe data extraction to ensure successful completion while providing comprehensive documentation of when Mask-RCNN support was added to OpenCV and extracting all names of contributors who worked on implementing this functionality, fully satisfying the PLAN requirements.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &#x27;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed the **PLAN** requirements.

Key achievements: (1) Successfully identified that Mask-RCNN support was first introduced in OpenCV version 3.4.3, released August 29, 2018, just 5 days after the commit, (2) Extracted complete contributor list from PR #12243 including commit authors, committers, reviewers, PR author (dkurt), and merger (alalek), (3) Identified all contributors: Dmitry Kurtaev as primary implementer, Alexander Alekhin as merger, and mshabunin as reviewer/assignee, (4) Provided detailed implementation statistics showing 2 commits, 9 files changed, +600/-153 lines, and 5 code reviews, (5) Saved comprehensive analysis to workspace file for future reference. The **PLAN** objective has been 100% achieved - the code successfully identified when Mask-RCNN model support was first added to OpenCV (version 3.4.3, August 2018) and extracted the names of all contributors who worked on implementing this functionality. No further development is needed.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &quot;Code Output: \n\n=== ROBUST OPENCV MASK-RCNN CONTRIBUTOR EXTRACTION ===\n\nObjective: Successfully extract all contributors with bulletproof error handling\nFocus: Complete PR #12243 analysis and contributor identification\n\nRepository: opencv/opencv\nTarget PR: #12243\nPrimary commit SHA: 472b71eceff52681222834545d85c36c7227f977\nWorkspace: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5\n\n=== STEP 1: PULL REQUEST #12243 ANALYSIS ===\n\nFetching PR data from: https://api.github.com/repos/opencv/opencv/pulls/12243\nResponse status: 200\n✅ Pull Request Details:\n   Title: Support Mask-RCNN from TensorFlow\n   Number: #12243\n   State: closed\n   Created: 2018-08-17T13:58:03Z\n   Merged: 2018-08-24T11:47:33Z\n   Author: dkurt (N/A)\n   Merged by: alalek (N/A)\n   Stats: 2 commits, 9 files, +600/-153 lines\n   Assignees: [&#x27;mshabunin (N/A)&#x27;]\n\n=== STEP 2: PR COMMITS ANALYSIS ===\n\nFetching commits from: https://api.github.com/repos/opencv/opencv/pulls/12243/commits\nResponse status: 200\n✅ Found 2 commits in PR #12243\n\n1.

<p>### Development Step 20: Find Tahir Yuldashev’s co-founded Islamic organization and the 1992 crackdown perpetrators</p>
<p>**Description**: Search for information about Tahir Yuldashev&#x27;s biographical details, focusing on identifying the organization he co-founded and the specific group or leader who conducted the 1992 crackdown against this organization. Look for details about his role as a former Soviet paratrooper, the Islamic organization he helped establish, and which government forces, military units, or leaders were responsible for the crackdown that forced him to flee in 1992.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Political risk assessment for an international security consultancy, automatically extracting extremist leaders’ organizational affiliations and crackdown timelines from archived search result JSON files<br>- Investigative journalism background verification, consolidating founders’ biographical details, military service records, and government response events from web search snippets<br>- Academic research in Central Asian history, automating the reconstruction of political movement timelines by parsing biographical data from multiple search result dumps<br>- Compliance screening in a global bank, programmatically identifying potential sanctions risks by extracting individual affiliations and past government crackdowns from open-source search archives<br>- Corporate due diligence in mergers and acquisitions, building candidate and executive background profiles by analyzing historic search data for military service and leadership roles<br>- NGO partner vetting and security risk management, evaluating affiliations of potential collaborators through deep inspection of search-engine result metadata<br>- Counterterrorism intelligence operations, synthesizing open-source search snippets into structured profiles of militant group founders and their interactions with state actors<br>- Digital humanities archiving, enriching metadata for political figure collections by extracting verified biographical facts from legacy search result JSON datasets</p>

<p>### Development Step 6: Extract First Name of 1983 East Germany Malko Competition Winner</p>
<p>**Description**: Analyze the extracted Malko Competition data from workspace files to identify the specific winner from East Germany and extract their first name. Focus on the 1983 winner Claus Peter who was identified as being from East Germany (a country that no longer exists). Verify this is the only recipient from the specified time period whose nationality corresponds to a defunct country, and extract the first name &#x27;Claus&#x27; as the answer to the task.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Archival music competition research to extract and index winners from defunct countries for a Cold War–era classical studies database<br>- Digital humanities project automating the identification of East German laureates in historical JSON archives for museum exhibit catalogs<br>- Government cultural heritage validation workflow that flags award recipients from obsolete national entities during data migration to modern registry systems<br>- Educational content pipeline that pulls first names of 1980s competition winners from legacy files to generate interactive timelines for music history courses<br>- Data migration utility converting legacy JSON records into a new relational database schema, specifically mapping defunct country codes like GDR to historical metadata tables<br>- Compliance and audit process for international arts funding programs that verifies recipient nationalities against current geopolitical boundaries and highlights entries from non-existent states<br>- Genealogical research assistant tool parsing competition archives to extract individual names and nationalities for family historians tracing East German musician lineages</p>

                <div class="content-text"><p>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements. The script successfully researched former Chinese heads of government and their transliterated names, compiling a comprehensive database of 26 leaders with 52 different transliterations including various romanization systems (Pinyin, Wade-Giles). The analysis compared these transliterations against the OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors (Dmitry Kurtaev, Alexander Alekhin, mshabunin) and found 11 low-confidence substring matches with similarity scores of 0.4. However, these matches are weak and primarily based on common letter sequences rather than meaningful name correlations. The code properly concluded that no significant matches exist between the OpenCV contributor names and transliterated names of Chinese government leaders. **PLAN** alignment: 100% - successfully researched Chinese leaders, performed comprehensive name comparison analysis, and provided clear findings. The comprehensive results have been saved to workspace for documentation. No further development is needed as the research objective has been fully completed with a definitive conclusion that the OpenCV contributors do not correspond to transliterations of former Chinese heads of government.</p></div>

=== STEP 5: FINAL ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS ===

📊 MATCH SUMMARY:
   High confidence (≥0.8): 0
   Medium confidence (0.5-0.8): 0
   Low confidence (0.3-0.5): 41
   Total matches: 41

❌ NO HIGH OR MEDIUM CONFIDENCE MATCHES FOUND

CONCLUSION: The OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors do not appear to
correspond to transliterations of Chinese heads of government.

This suggests that:
1. The contributors are likely Russian/Eastern European developers
2. Their names do not match Chinese political figures
3. Any low-confidence matches are likely coincidental

The script analyzed 45 Chinese leaders with 140 transliterations using multi-method similarity checking including phonetic analysis, character similarity, and part matching. Key findings: (1) No high or medium confidence matches found between OpenCV contributors and Chinese leader transliterations, (2) Only 41 low-confidence matches (score 0.3-0.5) were identified, with the best match being mshabunin ↔ Yuan Shikai at 0.375 similarity, (3) The analysis definitively concludes that OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors (Dmitry Kurtaev, Alexander Alekhin, mshabunin) do not correspond to transliterations of Chinese heads of government, confirming they are likely Russian/Eastern European developers. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the research successfully identified when Mask-RCNN was added to OpenCV, extracted all contributor names, and thoroughly compared them against Chinese leader transliterations with a clear negative result. The comprehensive analysis has been saved to workspace. No further development is needed as the research objectives have been fully satisfied with definitive conclusions.</p></div>

=== STEP 5: FINAL ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS ===

📊 MATCH SUMMARY:
   High confidence (≥0.8): 0
   Medium confidence (0.5-0.8): 0

   Total matches: 41

❌ NO HIGH OR MEDIUM CONFIDENCE MATCHES FOUND

CONCLUSION: The OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors do not appear to
correspond to transliterations of Chinese heads of government.

This suggests that:
1. The contributors are likely Russian/Eastern European developers
2. Their names do not match Chinese political figures
3. Any low-confidence matches are likely coincidental

This implementation searches GitHub&#x27;s API using multiple strategies to find Mask-RCNN related commits and issues in the opencv/opencv repository. The approach includes: (1) Comprehensive search using different naming variants (Mask-RCNN, Mask R-CNN, MaskRCNN) to capture all possible references, (2) Systematic collection of both commits and issues sorted chronologically to identify the earliest introduction, (3) OpenCV release information gathering to correlate commit dates with specific versions, (4) Detailed analysis and storage of results for further investigation. The code uses extensive print statements to track progress and findings, saves comprehensive results to workspace/opencv_maskrcnn_research.json for subsequent analysis, and prepares the foundation for deeper investigation into contributors and implementation details. This establishes the baseline data needed to identify the specific OpenCV version that introduced Mask-RCNN support and the development team involved.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &#x27;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed the initial phase of the **PLAN** research. The script identified the earliest Mask-RCNN commit from August 24, 2018, authored by Dmitry Kurtaev, and found 8 unique commits plus 30 related issues. Key finding: Mask-RCNN support was first introduced via pull request #12243 on 2018-08-24. The code also retrieved 66 OpenCV releases for version correlation. However, the **PLAN** requires deeper analysis to identify the specific OpenCV version and extract all contributor names.

This systematic approach ensures we understand our existing data before proceeding to extract all contributors involved in the Mask-RCNN implementation, advancing the PLAN toward identifying the specific OpenCV version and complete development team.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &#x27;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and effectively analyzed the previously saved research data.

Key findings confirmed: (1) First Mask-RCNN commit identified as SHA 472b71eceff52681222834545d85c36c7227f977 from August 24, 2018, authored by Dmitry Kurtaev and committed by Alexander Alekhin, (2) Associated with pull request #12243, (3) 8 unique commits and 30 issues found total. The code provides excellent preparation for the next phase by clearly identifying the critical commit SHA, pull request number, and timeline. **PLAN** alignment: 60% - solid progress made in identifying when and by whom Mask-RCNN was introduced, but still needs detailed contributor extraction from the specific pull request and commit analysis. Next step: Implement GitHub API calls to fetch detailed information about pull request #12243 and the specific commit to extract all contributors who worked on implementing Mask-RCNN support in OpenCV.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &quot;Code Output: \n\n=== INSPECTING OPENCV MASK-RCNN RESEARCH DATA ===\n\nObjective: Analyze saved research data and prepare for detailed commit analysis\nFocus: Understanding file structure before proceeding with contributor extraction\n\nUsing workspace directory: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5\nResearch file: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5/opencv_maskrcnn_research.json\nFile size: 429,420 bytes\n\n=== JSON FILE STRUCTURE INSPECTION ===\n\nTop-level keys:\n  research_timestamp: 2025-08-14T05:22:57.801436\n  repository: opencv/opencv\n  search_strategies: List with 4 items\n  search_results: Dictionary with 4 keys\n  analysis: Dictionary with 4 keys\n    Analysis sub-keys: [&#x27;total_unique_commits&#x27;, &#x27;total_unique_issues&#x27;, &#x27;earliest_commits&#x27;, &#x27;earliest_issues&#x27;]\n  releases_found: 66\n  next_steps: List with 4 items\n\n=== KEY FINDINGS FROM PREVIOUS RESEARCH ===\n\nTotal unique commits found: 8\nTotal unique issues found: 30\n\n=== EARLIEST COMMITS ANALYSIS ===\n\n1.

The code systematically extracts all names involved in the Mask-RCNN implementation process, correlates timing with OpenCV versions, and provides detailed statistics about the implementation scope. Results are saved to workspace for complete documentation of when Mask-RCNN was added and who contributed to its development, fully addressing the PLAN objectives.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Partial execution with critical error - Code started successfully and made good progress analyzing pull request #12243, retrieving basic PR details and identifying OpenCV version 3.4.3 as the likely first version with Mask-RCNN support (published August 29, 2018, 5 days after the commit). However, execution failed with a KeyError exception when trying to access the &#x27;name&#x27; field from user data, preventing extraction of detailed contributor information from commits and reviews. **PLAN** alignment: 70% - successfully identified the specific OpenCV version (3.4.3) and timeframe, but failed to extract the complete list of contributors as required. The comprehensive analysis file was saved but is incomplete due to the error. Next step: Fix the KeyError by adding proper null checks when accessing user &#x27;name&#x27; fields (use .get(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;N/A&#x27;) instead of direct access), then re-run to complete the

This implementation addresses the previous KeyError issues by: (1) Using safe dictionary access with .get() methods and proper None value handling throughout, (2) Implementing comprehensive error handling for all API calls to prevent execution failures, (3) Successfully extracting detailed information from PR #12243 including all commits, reviews, and contributor data, (4) Enriching contributor information with GitHub user profiles including company and location data, (5) Providing complete timeline correlation showing Mask-RCNN was first introduced in OpenCV 3.4.3 on August 29, 2018. The code systematically identifies and documents every person involved in the Mask-RCNN implementation: commit authors, committers, code reviewers, PR author, and merger. Results are comprehensively saved and presented, fully satisfying the PLAN requirements to identify when Mask-RCNN support was added to OpenCV and extract all contributor names from the development team.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution failed with KeyError - Code started well and successfully identified key information including OpenCV version 3.4.3 as the first version with Mask-RCNN support (published August 29, 2018). However, the execution failed with a KeyError exception when trying to access the &#x27;name&#x27; field from user data in the pull request analysis. This prevented the code from extracting the critical contributor information that the **PLAN** specifically requires. **PLAN** alignment: 70% - good progress on version identification but failed to extract the complete list of contributors. The error occurred because GitHub API user objects can have null &#x27;name&#x27; fields, requiring safe access patterns. Immediate fix needed: Replace direct dictionary access like user[&#x27;name&#x27;] with safe access using user.get(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;N/A&#x27;) or user.get(&#x27;name&#x27;) or &#x27;N/A&#x27; to handle missing name fields. Once fixed, the code should successfully extract all contributors from PR #12243 commits and reviews to complete the **PLAN** objectives.&quot;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &#x27;Code Output: \n\n=== FIXED OPENCV MASK-RCNN CONTRIBUTOR ANALYSIS ===\n\nObjective: Complete contributor extraction with proper error handling\nFocus: Fix KeyError issues and extract all contributors from PR #12243\n\nRepository: opencv/opencv\nTarget PR: #12243\nPrimary commit SHA: 472b71eceff52681222834545d85c36c7227f977\nWorkspace: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5\n\n=== STEP 1: ANALYZING PULL REQUEST #12243 (FIXED) ===\n\nPR API URL: https://api.github.com/repos/opencv/opencv/pulls/12243\nFound 12 results\n\n  Result 1:\n    Title: Translation of the 1913 Michaelis-Menten Paper - PMC\n    URL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3381512/\n    Snippet: Michaelis and Menten analyzed these data using the integrated form of the rate equations to compute a single constant, Const = C/KS, as described in the text.\n    ⭐ NIH INDICATORS: nih.gov, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, translation\n    📄 PAPER INDICATORS: michaelis, menten, 1913, equation\n    🎯 HIGH-PRIORITY: Official NIH/NCBI source\n    📋 ADDED TO CANDIDATES (Score: 27)\n\n  Result 2:\n    Title: translation of the 1913 Michaelis-Menten paper\n    URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21888353/\n    Snippet: Michaelis and Menten not only analyzed initial velocity measurements but also fit their full time course data to the integrated form of the rate equations, ...\n    ⭐ NIH INDICATORS: nih.gov, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, pubmed, translation\n    📄 PAPER INDICATORS: michaelis, menten, 1913, equation\n    🎯 HIGH-PRIORITY: Official NIH/NCBI source\n    📋 ADDED TO CANDIDATES (Score: 30)\n\n  Result 3:\n    Title: A Century of Enzyme Kinetic Analysis, 1913 to 2013 - PMC\n    URL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4624389/\n    Snippet: This review traces the history and logical progression of methods for quantitative analysis of enzyme kinetics from the 1913 Michaelis and Menten paper\n    ⭐ NIH INDICATORS: nih.gov, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n    📄 PAPER INDICATORS: michaelis, menten, 1913, kinetics, enzyme\n    🎯 HIGH-PRIORITY: Official NIH/NCBI source\n    📋 ADDED TO CANDIDATES (Score: 26)\n\n  Result 4:\n    Title: Some lessons about models from Michaelis and Menten\n    URL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3279381/\n    Snippet: Michaelis and Menten\&#x27;s classic 1913 paper on enzyme kinetics is used to draw some lessons about the relationship between mathematical models and biological ...\n    ⭐ NIH INDICATORS: nih.gov, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n    📄 PAPER INDICATORS: michaelis, menten, 1913, kinetics, enzyme\n    🎯 HIGH-PRIORITY: Official NIH/NCBI source\n    📋 ADDED TO CANDIDATES (Score: 26)\n\n  Result 5:\n    Title: Translation of the 1913 Michaelis-Menten Paper\n    URL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51615754_The_Original_Michaelis_Constant_Translation_of_the_1913_Michaelis-Menten_Paper\n    Snippet: Michaelis and Menten not only analyzed initial velocity measurements but also fit their full time course data to the integrated form of the rate equations, ...\n    ⭐ NIH INDICATORS: translation\n    📄 PAPER INDICATORS: michaelis, menten, 1913, equation\n    📋 ADDED TO CANDIDATES (Score: 11)\n\n  Result 6:\n    Title: Commemorating the 1913 Michaelis–Menten paper Die ...\n    URL: https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/febs.12598\n    Snippet: This equation results from the law of mass action A × B/AB = K and the conservation sum B + AB = BT.

This final implementation addresses all previous KeyError issues by: (1) Implementing a safe_get() helper function that handles nested dictionary access with proper fallbacks for None values, (2) Using comprehensive try-catch blocks around all API calls to prevent execution failures, (3) Systematically extracting information from PR #12243 including all commits, reviews, author, merger, and assignees, (4) Providing detailed analysis of the implementation timeline showing Mask-RCNN was first introduced in OpenCV 3.4.3 on August 29, 2018, just 5 days after the commit, (5) Compiling a complete list of all contributors including commit authors, committers, code reviewers, PR author, and merger. The code uses extensive error handling and safe data extraction to ensure successful completion while providing comprehensive documentation of when Mask-RCNN support was added to OpenCV and extracting all names of contributors who worked on implementing this functionality, fully satisfying the PLAN requirements.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &#x27;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed the **PLAN** requirements.

Key achievements: (1) Successfully identified that Mask-RCNN support was first introduced in OpenCV version 3.4.3, released August 29, 2018, just 5 days after the commit, (2) Extracted complete contributor list from PR #12243 including commit authors, committers, reviewers, PR author (dkurt), and merger (alalek), (3) Identified all contributors: Dmitry Kurtaev as primary implementer, Alexander Alekhin as merger, and mshabunin as reviewer/assignee, (4) Provided detailed implementation statistics showing 2 commits, 9 files changed, +600/-153 lines, and 5 code reviews, (5) Saved comprehensive analysis to workspace file for future reference. The **PLAN** objective has been 100% achieved - the code successfully identified when Mask-RCNN model support was first added to OpenCV (version 3.4.3, August 2018) and extracted the names of all contributors who worked on implementing this functionality. No further development is needed.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &quot;Code Output: \n\n=== ROBUST OPENCV MASK-RCNN CONTRIBUTOR EXTRACTION ===\n\nObjective: Successfully extract all contributors with bulletproof error handling\nFocus: Complete PR #12243 analysis and contributor identification\n\nRepository: opencv/opencv\nTarget PR: #12243\nPrimary commit SHA: 472b71eceff52681222834545d85c36c7227f977\nWorkspace: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5\n\n=== STEP 1: PULL REQUEST #12243 ANALYSIS ===\n\nFetching PR data from: https://api.github.com/repos/opencv/opencv/pulls/12243\nResponse status: 200\n✅ Pull Request Details:\n   Title: Support Mask-RCNN from TensorFlow\n   Number: #12243\n   State: closed\n   Created: 2018-08-17T13:58:03Z\n   Merged: 2018-08-24T11:47:33Z\n   Author: dkurt (N/A)\n   Merged by: alalek (N/A)\n   Stats: 2 commits, 9 files, +600/-153 lines\n   Assignees: [&#x27;mshabunin (N/A)&#x27;]\n\n=== STEP 2: PR COMMITS ANALYSIS ===\n\nFetching commits from: https://api.github.com/repos/opencv/opencv/pulls/12243/commits\nResponse status: 200\n✅ Found 2 commits in PR #12243\n\n1.

OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors with transliterated names of former Chinese heads of government. This implementation: (1) Compiles an extensive database of Chinese political leaders including Premiers, Presidents, CCP General Secretaries, and historical figures from both PRC and ROC periods, (2) Includes multiple transliteration systems (Pinyin, Wade-Giles) for each leader to capture various romanization approaches, (3) Implements sophisticated name comparison algorithms checking for exact matches, partial matches, substring similarities, and phonetic similarities, (4) Systematically compares each OpenCV contributor (Dmitry Kurtaev, Alexander Alekhin, mshabunin) against all transliterations with confidence scoring, (5) Attempts web searches for additional Chinese leader transliterations to supplement the known database. The analysis covers major Chinese leaders from Sun Yat-sen and Yuan Shikai through modern leaders like Xi Jinping, examining whether any transliterated names match the Russian/international names of the OpenCV developers. Results are comprehensively documented and saved for verification of any potential matches between the contributor names and Chinese government officials&#x27; romanized names.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &#x27;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements. The script successfully researched former Chinese heads of government and their transliterated names, compiling a comprehensive database of 26 leaders with 52 different transliterations including various romanization systems (Pinyin, Wade-Giles). The analysis compared these transliterations against the OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors (Dmitry Kurtaev, Alexander Alekhin, mshabunin) and found 11 low-confidence substring matches with similarity scores of 0.4. However, these matches are weak and primarily based on common letter sequences rather than meaningful name correlations. The code properly concluded that no significant matches exist between the OpenCV contributor names and transliterated names of Chinese government leaders. **PLAN** alignment: 100% - successfully researched Chinese leaders, performed comprehensive name comparison analysis, and provided clear findings. The comprehensive results have been saved to workspace for documentation. No further development is needed as the research objective has been fully completed with a definitive conclusion that the OpenCV contributors do not correspond to transliterations of former Chinese heads of government.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &#x27;Code Output: \n\n=== CHINESE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT RESEARCH ===\n\nObjective: Research former Chinese heads of government and their transliterated names\nFocus: Compare with OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors: Dmitry Kurtaev, Alexander Alekhin, mshabunin\n\nUsing workspace directory: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5\n\nOpenCV Mask-RCNN Contributors to match:\n  1.

This implementation: (1) Examines previous analysis results to build upon prior work, (2) Significantly expands the Chinese leaders database to include Qing Dynasty emperors, additional Republic of China leaders, warlord era figures, and early CCP leaders with multiple transliteration systems (Pinyin, Wade-Giles, variations), (3) Implements advanced name matching algorithms including phonetic similarity analysis, part-based matching, character similarity scoring, and Chinese romanization variation handling, (4) Performs comprehensive comparison of all OpenCV contributors (Dmitry Kurtaev, Alexander Alekhin, mshabunin) against the expanded database of transliterations, (5) Categorizes matches by confidence levels and provides detailed analysis of similarity types and scores. The code analyzes over 100 transliterations across multiple historical periods and transliteration systems to definitively determine whether the OpenCV contributor names correspond to any Chinese political figures. Results are comprehensively documented with confidence scoring and detailed match analysis to provide a conclusive answer to the research question.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &#x27;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed a comprehensive analysis expanding on the previous research with significantly more Chinese leaders and advanced matching algorithms. The script analyzed 45 Chinese leaders with 140 transliterations using multi-method similarity checking including phonetic analysis, character similarity, and part matching. Key findings: (1) No high or medium confidence matches found between OpenCV contributors and Chinese leader transliterations, (2) Only 41 low-confidence matches (score 0.3-0.5) were identified, with the best match being mshabunin ↔ Yuan Shikai at 0.375 similarity, (3) The analysis definitively concludes that OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors (Dmitry Kurtaev, Alexander Alekhin, mshabunin) do not correspond to transliterations of Chinese heads of government, confirming they are likely Russian/Eastern European developers. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the research successfully identified when Mask-RCNN was added to OpenCV, extracted all contributor names, and thoroughly compared them against Chinese leader transliterations with a clear negative result. The comprehensive analysis has been saved to workspace. No further development is needed as the research objectives have been fully satisfied with definitive conclusions.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &quot;Code Output: \n\n=== COMPREHENSIVE CHINESE LEADERS VS OPENCV CONTRIBUTORS ANALYSIS ===\n\nObjective: Expand research on Chinese heads of government transliterations\nFocus: Deep analysis of previous results and additional transliteration systems\n\nUsing workspace directory: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5\n\n=== STEP 1: EXAMINING PREVIOUS ANALYSIS RESULTS ===\n\n📄 Found previous analysis: chinese_leaders_opencv_comparison.json\n   OpenCV contributors: [&#x27;Dmitry Kurtaev&#x27;, &#x27;Alexander Alekhin&#x27;, &#x27;mshabunin&#x27;]\n   Previous matches found: 11\n   Match confidence breakdown: High=0, Medium=0, Low=11\n📄 Found previous analysis: opencv_maskrcnn_final_analysis.json\n\n=== STEP 2: EXPANDING CHINESE LEADERS DATABASE ===\n\nExpanded Chinese leaders database:\n\nQING DYNASTY EMPERORS (5 leaders):\n  • 康熙 -
