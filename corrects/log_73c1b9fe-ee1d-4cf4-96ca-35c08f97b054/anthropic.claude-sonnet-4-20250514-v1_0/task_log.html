The solution correctly identified and listed all six U.S. Secretaries of Homeland Security who served prior to April 2019, excluding those who served in acting capacity only. The final implementation successfully accessed authoritative sources and provided a verified list of secretaries with their term dates, presidents they served under, and additional relevant notes. The data was properly formatted and saved to a JSON file in the workspace directory.

The code identified the six US Secretaries of Homeland Security who served before April 2019 (excluding acting secretaries) and successfully extracted their bachelor&#x27;s degree information.\n\nHere&#x27;s a summary of the results:\n\n1. Tom Ridge: Harvard University (BA)\n2. Michael Chertoff: Harvard University (BA)\n3. Janet Napolitano: Santa Clara University (BS)\n4. Jeh Johnson: Morehouse College (BA)\n5. John F. Kelly: University of Massachusetts Boston (BA)\n6. Kirstjen Nielsen: Georgetown University (BS)\n\nThe final approach used a direct hardcoded list of secretaries since the Wikipedia table parsing proved unreliable. The bachelor&#x27;s degree extraction was improved with more sophisticated pattern matching techniques that successfully identified all degrees.\n\nThe code achieved all the requirements of the PLAN, identifying both the secretaries who served prior to April 2019 and their educational backgrounds with a focus on where they received their bachelor&#x27;s degrees.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &quot;Research the geographic locations of all universities where former US Secretaries of Homeland Security (who served prior to April 2019, excluding acting secretaries) obtained their bachelor&#x27;s degrees. Identify the longitude and latitude coordinates for each university to determine which is the westernmost and which is the easternmost.&quot;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is the optimal next step because: (1) We&#x27;ve already identified all six formal Secretaries and their bachelor&#x27;s degree universities, (2) The previous developer work confirmed these universities as Harvard (Ridge, Chertoff), Santa Clara University, Morehouse College, University of Massachusetts Boston, and Georgetown University, (3) Expected outcome is the geographic coordinates of each university to determine westernmost and easternmost locations, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK requirement of identifying the westernmost and easternmost universities by city location.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;The task has already been successfully completed. Based on the HISTORY, the code has been implemented and executed without any critical errors. The script successfully researched the geographic locations of universities where former US Secretaries of Homeland Security obtained their bachelor\&#x27;s degrees, identified the coordinates for each university, and determined that Santa Clara University (attended by Janet Napolitano) is the westernmost university at longitude -121.936544 and University of Massachusetts Boston (attended by John F. Kelly) is the easternmost university at longitude -71.0387132. All results were properly saved to JSON and CSV files. According to the tester\&#x27;s feedback in the last execution, &quot;The PLAN requirements have been completely met, and no further development is needed.&quot;&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This step is necessary because: (1) We&#x27;ve already identified Santa Clara University as the westernmost university and University of Massachusetts Boston as the easternmost university from previous research, (2) The HISTORY shows we have their coordinates but need to explicitly identify their city locations, (3) Expected outcome is the names of the cities where these universities are located, (4) The TASK specifically requests a comma-separated list of city names rather than university names, with westernmost first.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;Based on the HISTORY, the task has been successfully completed. Through multiple successful script executions, we\&#x27;ve consistently confirmed that Santa Clara University (longitude -121.936544) is the westernmost university and University of Massachusetts Boston (longitude -71.0387132) is the easternmost university.\n\nThe required comma-separated list with the westernmost city first, followed by the easternmost city, is &quot;Santa Clara, Boston&quot;. This result has been properly verified and saved to workspace/university_cities.txt in the most recent execution.\n\nThe PLAN has been fully implemented with the correct result produced and saved to the specified location. No further development is needed as confirmed by the tester\&#x27;s feedback.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. Based on our research, we identified all individuals who formally held the position of United States secretary of homeland security prior to April 2019 (excluding acting secretaries): Tom Ridge, Michael Chertoff, Janet Napolitano, Jeh Johnson, John F. Kelly, and Kirstjen Nielsen. We determined their bachelor&#x27;s degree institutions and locations: Harvard University (Ridge, Chertoff), Santa Clara University (Napolitano), Morehouse College (Johnson), University of Massachusetts Boston (Kelly), and Georgetown University (Nielsen). Geographic coordinate analysis confirmed that Santa Clara University is the westernmost university (longitude -121.936544) located in Santa Clara, and University of Massachusetts Boston is the easternmost university (longitude -71.0387132) located in Boston.

Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.<br><br>**Use Cases**:<br>- Archiving and trend analysis for music historians mapping post-1977 Malko Competition winners by nationality and geopolitical context<br>- Classical music database enrichment with automated extraction of winner names, years, and historical country tags for digital library platforms<br>- Academic research into Cold War–era cultural exchanges, using detailed Malko Competition data for musicology theses on geopolitical influences<br>- Museum exhibition curation displaying Malko Competition laureates from defunct states (USSR, Yugoslavia, etc.) to illustrate 20th-century political shifts<br>- Government cultural policy evaluation assessing how nation-state transformations impacted participation and success rates in international music contests<br>- University course material development, creating interactive timelines of Malko Competition winners tied to historical country changes for world history or music studies<br>- Record label marketing analytics identifying award-winning artists’ regional origins and historical backgrounds to drive targeted promotional campaigns<br><br>```<br>import os<br>import json<br><br>print(&quot;=== MALKO COMPETITION FINAL PHASE: COMPREHENSIVE RESULTS SUMMARY ===&quot;)<br>print(&quot;Objective: Create detailed summary of all post-1977 20th century winners with nationality focus\n&quot;)<br><br># First, let&#x27;s inspect the extracted results file to understand its structure<br>results_file = &#x27;workspace/malko_winners_1978_2000.json&#x27;<br><br>if not os.path.exists(results_file):<br>    print(f&quot;Results file not found: {results_file}&quot;)<br>    print(&quot;Available files in workspace:&quot;)<br>    if os.path.exists(&#x27;workspace&#x27;):<br>        for file in os.listdir(&#x27;workspace&#x27;):<br>            print(f&quot;

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution partially successful with critical error - The code successfully conducted 7 targeted searches and found 99 total results, but failed during result processing due to a variable scope error (&#x27;name &#x27;title&#x27; is not defined&#x27;). The search API calls worked correctly and consistently found the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database link (nas.er.usgs.gov) in every search, which is highly relevant to the **PLAN**. However, the code crashed during result analysis, preventing proper extraction of USGS-specific content and missing the opportunity to identify that key USGS resource. **PLAN** alignment: 40% - searches executed but analysis incomplete. The code did save results to JSON file, but the data is likely incomplete due to the processing error. Immediate fix needed: The variable &#x27;title&#x27; is being used outside its defined scope in the result processing loop. Move the variable definitions before the analysis logic or restructure the exception handling to prevent the scope issue.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution partially successful with critical error - The code successfully fixed the previous variable scope issue and processed all 7 searches with 99 total results. It correctly identified 66 USGS-related results and found 19 key findings, including multiple references to the crucial USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database (nas.er.usgs.gov). The analysis successfully extracted specific USGS resources, identified western state mentions (Arizona, California, New Mexico), and found range expansion terminology. However, the code crashed at the end with &#x27;NameError: name &#x27;link&#x27; is not defined&#x27; during the final resource processing loop. **PLAN** alignment: 85% - comprehensive USGS content identification completed, but final output generation incomplete. The processed data was successfully saved to &#x27;workspace/processed_usgs_alligator_results.json&#x27;. Key achievement: Identified the primary USGS NAS database as the priority resource for American Alligator distribution data west of Texas. Immediate fix needed: The final loop has a variable scope error with &#x27;link&#x27; - ensure all variables are properly defined within the loop scope.

The code attempted to access processed search results from previous analysis but couldn&#x27;t locate the file due to workspace path mismatch (looking for &#x27;workspace/&#x27; but file is in &#x27;workspace_73c1b9fe-ee1d-4cf4-96ca-35c08f97b054/&#x27;). The code did find the original search results file &#x27;usgs_alligator_range_expansion_search_results.json&#x27; in the correct workspace directory. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no USGS database access completed due to file path issue. The code was designed to access the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database which is the correct approach for finding American Alligator range expansion data west of Texas. Immediate fix needed: Update the file path to use the correct workspace directory name, or modify the code to work with the available &#x27;usgs_alligator_range_expansion_search_results.json&#x27; file directly to extract USGS NAS database URLs and proceed with accessing the database.

The alligators spotted in Essex County, New Jersey, may have escaped a lagoon in Military Park, Newark (Anonymous in Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).  Perhaps they had been part of a public animal display.  The A. mississippiensis collected from Mesa County, Colorado, escaped from a roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998), while the one collected from the Colorado River in California had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978).   	Conant (1977) suggested that an animal dealer intentionally established the A. mississippiensis population found in the Brownsville area of Cameron County, Texas.

One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).   	All A. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).   	Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous A. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are &quot;thriving.&quot; There is no evidence of reproduction.   	There is a possibility that introduced American alligators in Oklahoma may establish populations in or near the southeastern corner of the state; thus interacting with indigenous populations in this region ([Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]).   	The A. mississippiensis populations in the Brownsville area, Cameron County, and the surrounding lower Rio Grande Valley are established but some authors suggest they could be nonindigenous (Conant, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998).  Since alligators were reported from the Brownsville region before the presumptive introductions took place (Baird, 1859), they are probably indigenous (Ross and Ernst, 1994).  Indigenous populations may have simply been augmented by intentional introductions (Conant, 1977).   	The A. mississippiensis in Boulder, Colorado, was collected (Livo et al., 1998).  Only one of the American alligators was collected from the Colorado River, Mesa County, Colorado; the other was never recaptured, but there is no evidence of an established population (Livo et al., 1998).   	The American alligators from Phoenix, Arizona, were collected (M. Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as &quot;not well established&quot; in Arizona.

Full line: Status: All the American alligators found in New York have been collected (Anderson and Habuda, 2001; Anonymous, 2001a, b; Beebe, 2001c; Heaton-Jones, 2001; Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).  They are not established in this state nor could they survive the cold winters, and the story of alligators dwelling in New York City sewers is simply a well-entrenched myth (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).   	One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).   	All A. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).   	Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous A. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are &quot;thriving.&quot; There is no evidence of reproduction.   	There is a possibility that introduced American alligators in Oklahoma may establish populations in or near the southeastern corner of the state; thus interacting with indigenous populations in this region ([Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]).   	The A. mississippiensis populations in the Brownsville area, Cameron County, and the surrounding lower Rio Grande Valley are established but some authors suggest they could be nonindigenous (Conant, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998).  Since alligators were reported from the Brownsville region before the presumptive introductions took place (Baird, 1859), they are probably indigenous (Ross and Ernst, 1994).  Indigenous populations may have simply been augmented by intentional introductions (Conant, 1977).   	The A. mississippiensis in Boulder, Colorado, was collected (Livo et al., 1998).  Only one of the American alligators was collected from the Colorado River, Mesa County, Colorado; the other was never recaptured, but there is no evidence of an established population (Livo et al., 1998).   	The American alligators from Phoenix, Arizona, were collected (M. Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as &quot;not well established&quot; in Arizona.

One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).   	All A. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).   	Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous A. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are &quot;thriving.&quot; There is no evidence of reproduction.   	There is a possibility that introduced American alligators in Oklahoma may establish populations in or near the southeastern corner of the state; thus interacting with indigenous populations in this region ([Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]).   	The A. mississippiensis populations in the Brownsville area, Cameron County, and the surrounding lower Rio Grande Valley are established but some authors suggest they could be nonindigenous (Conant, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998).  Since alligators were reported from the Brownsville region before the presumptive introductions took place (Baird, 1859), they are probably indigenous (Ross and Ernst, 1994).  Indigenous populations may have simply been augmented by intentional introductions (Conant, 1977).   	The A. mississippiensis in Boulder, Colorado, was collected (Livo et al., 1998).  Only one of the American alligators was collected from the Colorado River, Mesa County, Colorado; the other was never recaptured, but there is no evidence of an established population (Livo et al., 1998).   	The American alligators from Phoenix, Arizona, were collected (M. Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as &quot;not well established&quot; in Arizona.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully extracted comprehensive American Alligator distribution data from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database. The implementation correctly accessed the primary USGS NAS database (nas.er.usgs.gov) and extracted detailed information about American Alligator occurrences west of Texas. Key achievements: (1) Found specific data for 3 western states - California (first observed 1954), Arizona (1990), and Colorado (1978), (2) Extracted detailed distribution table showing first and last observations by state, (3) Identified that these are non-indigenous occurrences from escaped/released pets rather than natural range expansion, (4) Saved comprehensive data to multiple files including full HTML pages and structured JSON. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - successfully documented USGS records of American Alligator first appearances west of Texas with specific dates and locations. The output contains extensive valuable data (200+ lines) that should be saved for future reference. Recommendation: Save the detailed output to &#x27;workspace/usgs_alligator_analysis_summary.txt&#x27; to preserve this comprehensive USGS documentation of American Alligator distribution west of Texas including the critical finding that California had the earliest western occurrence in 1954.

The alligators spotted in Essex County, New Jersey, may have escaped a lagoon in Military Park, Newark (Anonymous in Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).  Perhaps they had been part of a public animal display.  The A. mississippiensis collected from Mesa County, Colorado, escaped from a roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998), while the one collected from the Colorado River in California had been released (intentionally?) from a traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978).   	Conant (1977) suggested that an animal dealer intentionally established the A. mississippiensis population found in the Brownsville area of Cameron County, Texas.

One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).   	All A. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).   	Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous A. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are &quot;thriving.&quot; There is no evidence of reproduction.   	There is a possibility that introduced American alligators in Oklahoma may establish populations in or near the southeastern corner of the state; thus interacting with indigenous populations in this region ([Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]).   	The A. mississippiensis populations in the Brownsville area, Cameron County, and the surrounding lower Rio Grande Valley are established but some authors suggest they could be nonindigenous (Conant, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998).  Since alligators were reported from the Brownsville region before the presumptive introductions took place (Baird, 1859), they are probably indigenous (Ross and Ernst, 1994).  Indigenous populations may have simply been augmented by intentional introductions (Conant, 1977).   	The A. mississippiensis in Boulder, Colorado, was collected (Livo et al., 1998).  Only one of the American alligators was collected from the Colorado River, Mesa County, Colorado; the other was never recaptured, but there is no evidence of an established population (Livo et al., 1998).   	The American alligators from Phoenix, Arizona, were collected (M. Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as &quot;not well established&quot; in Arizona.

Conant (1977) suggested that an animal dealer intentionally established the A. mississippiensis population found in the Brownsville area of Cameron County, Texas.

One of the alligators found in Union County, New Jersey, was collected; although there is no further word about the success of the 1933 great gator hunt started on the Passaic River in Essex County (Mikkelson and Mikkelson, 2001).   	All A. mississippiensis from Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and California were collected with no further evidence of established populations (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978; Green and Pauley, 1987; Mitchell, 1994; Minton, 2001).   	Palmer and Braswell (1995) provide little detail of nonindigenous A. mississippiensis in North Carolina, but suggest some individuals are &quot;thriving.&quot; There is no evidence of reproduction.   	There is a possibility that introduced American alligators in Oklahoma may establish populations in or near the southeastern corner of the state; thus interacting with indigenous populations in this region ([Sievert] and Sievert, [1988]).   	The A. mississippiensis populations in the Brownsville area, Cameron County, and the surrounding lower Rio Grande Valley are established but some authors suggest they could be nonindigenous (Conant, 1977; Conant and Collins, 1998).  Since alligators were reported from the Brownsville region before the presumptive introductions took place (Baird, 1859), they are probably indigenous (Ross and Ernst, 1994).  Indigenous populations may have simply been augmented by intentional introductions (Conant, 1977).   	The A. mississippiensis in Boulder, Colorado, was collected (Livo et al., 1998).  Only one of the American alligators was collected from the Colorado River, Mesa County, Colorado; the other was never recaptured, but there is no evidence of an established population (Livo et al., 1998).   	The American alligators from Phoenix, Arizona, were collected (M. Demlong, personal communication 1997); however, Howland (1996) lists this species as &quot;not well established&quot; in Arizona.

Complete Analysis Summary from USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database

**PRIMARY FINDING**: The USGS NAS database contains comprehensive documentation of American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) occurrences west of Texas, with the earliest western occurrence documented in CALIFORNIA in 1954.

**KEY WESTERN STATE OCCURRENCES (First Documented by USGS):**

1. **CALIFORNIA - 1954** (EARLIEST WESTERN OCCURRENCE)
   - First Observed: 1954
   - Last Observed: 2023
   - Total HUCs with observations: 9
   - Locations: Butte Creek, Imperial Reservoir, Lower American, Lower Sacramento, San Gabriel, San Joaquin Delta, San Pablo Bay, Upper Cache, Upper Calaveras California
   - Status: All specimens collected, no established populations
   - Source: Colorado River specimen released from traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978)

2. **COLORADO - 1978**
   - First Observed: 1978
   - Last Observed: 2009
   - Total HUCs with observations: 3
   - Locations: Colorado Headwaters-Plateau, North Fork Gunnison, St. Vrain
   - Status: Specimens collected, no established populations
   - Source: Boulder specimen escaped pets; Mesa County specimen escaped roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998)

3. **ARIZONA - 1990**
   - First Observed: 1990
   - Last Observed: 2007
   - Total HUCs with observations: 2
   - Locations: Lake Mead, Lower Salt (including Phoenix area - Papago Park ponds, McCormick Ranch)
   - Status: All specimens collected, &quot;not well established&quot; (Howland, 1996)
   - Source: Escaped or deliberately released pets

4. **NEVADA - 2009**
   - First Observed: 2009
   - Last Observed: 2009
   - Total HUCs with observations: 1
   - Location: Las Vegas Wash

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**: These are NOT natural range expansions but rather nonindigenous occurrences from escaped or released captive animals.

**NATIVE RANGE BOUNDARY**: According to USGS, the indigenous range extends &quot;westward through the Deep South to central Texas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma&quot; - Texas represents the natural western limit.

**MEANS OF INTRODUCTION WEST OF TEXAS**:
- Escaped or deliberately released pets (primary cause)
- Roadside zoo escapes (Colorado)
- Traveling carnival releases (California)
- No evidence of natural westward range expansion

**ESTABLISHMENT STATUS**:
- NO established breeding populations west of Texas
- All western occurrences represent temporary, non-reproducing introductions
- Specimens typically collected by authorities when discovered

**USGS DATABASE COVERAGE**:

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements comprehensively. The implementation successfully created a detailed analysis summary of USGS records documenting American Alligator distribution west of Texas. Key findings: (1) California 1954 was the earliest western occurrence, (2) Complete chronological documentation of first appearances in Arizona (1990), Colorado (1978), and Nevada (2009), (3) Clear identification that these represent non-indigenous introductions rather than natural range expansion, (4) Comprehensive data from USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database with specific locations and sources. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the objective to find USGS documentation of when American Alligators were first found west of Texas has been fully achieved. The analysis provides definitive answers with proper USGS citations and saves all findings to a structured summary file. No further development is needed as the **PLAN** requirements have been completely fulfilled with authoritative USGS documentation.
