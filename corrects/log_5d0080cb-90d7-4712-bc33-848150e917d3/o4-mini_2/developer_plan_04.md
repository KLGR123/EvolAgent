# Developer Plan #4 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 5d0080cb-90d7-4712-bc33-848150e917d3  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 4  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-02 03:58:51

## Plan Content
```
Search recursively under all directories starting with "workspace" for a file named "university_of_leicester_dragon_diet.pdf" and output the full path(s) where that PDF is located.
```

## Plan Description
```
This plan is optimal because: (1) The developer reported that neither the PDF nor the extraction output exists, blocking progress; (2) Verifying the actual location or absence of the PDF is necessary before any volume extraction can occur; (3) The expected outcome is to identify the exact path of the paper PDF in the workspace or confirm its absence; (4) This directly clears the blockage and enables the subsequent extraction of the fish bag volume in m¬≥.

### Development Step 9: Download Westerink‚Äôs "A Dark Trace" from Project MUSE and Extract Chapter 2‚Äôs Influential Author

**Description**: Access and download the full text of 'A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt' by H. Westerink from Project MUSE using DOI 10.1353/book.24372. Since the book was confirmed to be open access, retrieve the complete text and save it to workspace/dark_trace_freud_book.pdf or appropriate format. Focus on locating and extracting Chapter 2 content to identify the author who influenced Freud's belief in 'endopsychic myths'. If the full book is not directly downloadable, extract Chapter 2 specifically or access the book's table of contents to determine the exact chapter title and content structure.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal due diligence in corporate mergers: automatically download open-access regulatory codes in PDF, search for ‚Äúantitrust‚Äù and ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù term variations, extract and summarize context to identify potential deal blockers.
- Pharmaceutical literature review automation: fetch clinical trial protocols via DOI, load full-text PDFs, search for ‚Äúdouble-blind‚Äù and ‚Äúplacebo‚Äù mentions, and extract methodological passages along with author names for evidence synthesis.
- Patent portfolio analysis for semiconductor R&D: retrieve patent documents from public repositories, scan PDFs for ‚Äúheterojunction‚Äù and ‚Äúquantum well‚Äù variants, extract inventor citations and contextual explanations to map technology lineage.
- Historical philosophy research on Nietzsche and Kant: access digitized editions of 19th-century works, locate references to ‚Äúcategorical imperative‚Äù or ‚Äúwill to power,‚Äù and extract surrounding paragraphs to trace cross-author influences.
- Competitive intelligence from SEC filings: download publicly available 10-K and 10-Q reports, search for ‚Äúrisk factor,‚Äù ‚Äúliquidity risk,‚Äù and ‚Äúmarket volatility‚Äù variations, and pull relevant excerpts for financial analysis dashboards.
- Academic curriculum design from open textbooks: ingest complete PDF textbooks via DOIs, locate chapter summaries or ‚Äúlearning objectives‚Äù headings, extract and compile structured outlines for course syllabi.
- Investigative journalism document mining: import leaked policy PDFs, search for ‚Äúwhistleblower,‚Äù ‚Äúconfidential,‚Äù and ‚Äúinternal memo‚Äù terms, extract context with names and dates to support storytelling.
- Compliance monitoring in healthcare: load clinical guideline PDFs, scan for ‚Äúcontraindication,‚Äù ‚Äúadverse effect,‚Äù and ‚Äúoff-label‚Äù variations, and extract detailed sections with authoring bodies for automated policy updates.

**Description**: Search for Nedoshivina's 2010 scientific paper that includes descriptions of Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov. Focus on finding the complete publication with methods/materials sections or specimen repository information. Use these search approaches: (1) Academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or ResearchGate using keywords 'Nedoshivina 2010 Vietnamese specimens Kuznetzov', (2) Taxonomic databases that might reference specimen deposits, (3) Journal archives that published the paper in 2010. Look specifically for sections mentioning specimen deposition, museum collections, or institutional repositories where the Vietnamese materials were stored.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum curators automatically extracting specimen deposition details from Nedoshivina‚Äôs 2010 catalogue to update and verify their Tortricidae collection database at ZISP
- Biodiversity informaticians harvesting Vietnamese Tortricidae origin and repository metadata from published PDFs to integrate into a global species occurrence platform
- Academic researchers conducting a meta‚Äêanalysis of Tortricidae diversity by programmatically discovering, downloading, and parsing type specimen catalogues from online archives
- Digital librarians automating the discovery and archiving of obscure entomological publications in Atalanta to ensure complete institutional repository holdings
- Grant administrators monitoring open‚Äêaccess compliance by locating and validating full‚Äêtext taxonomic papers in Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and journal archives
- Conservation biologists retrieving museum accession numbers and collection localities from PDF methods sections to model habitat suitability for endangered moth species
- Systematics PhD students streamlining their literature reviews by scraping abstracts, methods/materials, and repository information from historical taxonomic papers
- Data journalists investigating transparency in specimen reporting by aggregating repository details from multiple scientific databases into an interactive dashboard

    "description": "Implementation rationale:\n\n1. **Current Directory**: Captures and prints the CWD for context.\n2. **Workspace Discovery**: Uses both a top-level glob (cwd/workspace*) and a recursive glob (cwd/**/workspace*) to locate all folders whose names start with 'workspace'. This covers nested workspace_<UUID> directories.\n3. **Target Search & Debug Collection**: For each workspace directory, recursively walks the file tree:\n   - If a file ends with '.pdf' (case-insensitive), it‚Äôs added to `all_pdfs_in_workspaces` for debugging.\n   - If the filename exactly matches `target_filename` (case-insensitive), it‚Äôs recorded in `found_paths` and printed immediately.\n4. **Workspace Search Summary**: Prints the results:\n   - If the target PDF is found, lists its full path(s).\n   - If not found, prints a debug listing of every PDF under the workspace directories (or notes none exist).\n5. **Full Project PDF Dump**: If after workspace scanning the target PDF is still not found, performs a project-wide `os.walk` over the entire CWD to dump all PDF file paths. This helps identify the actual location and exact name of any PDF in the project, enabling you to correct typos or adjust the search pattern in subsequent runs.\n\nThis addresses the SyntaxError from stray backslashes, expands the workspace discovery per tester guidance, and provides comprehensive debugging outputs to locate any PDF file in the full project tree.",
