## Final Answer
```
2020
```

## True Answer
```
2003
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the publication year of a book focusing on 19th-century violin performance practices that argues vibrato usage is influenced by repertoire rather than national schools and compares German school techniques with performers using bent thumb/curved pinkie bow hold. Member evaluation: Member 1 conducted systematic research identifying David Milsom's 'Romantic Violin Performance Practices: A Handbook' (Cambridge University Press/Boydell Press, 2020) through comprehensive web searches and verification across multiple authoritative sources. The analysis included proper bibliographic verification and content confirmation across 4+ MB of academic documents. Member 2 employed similar methodology, initially identifying multiple candidates but ultimately converging on the same Milsom 2020 publication through Google Books API and academic database cross-referencing. Both members provided detailed scoring systems and verification processes. Member 3 focused on Robin Stowell's 1985 work 'Violin Technique and Performance Practice in the Late Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries' but acknowledged inability to verify the specific content arguments due to limited text access, then identified alternative sources but without definitive content verification. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on the Milsom 2020 publication, with both providing detailed verification of the book's existence, authorship, and publisher information. Member 3's 1985 candidate lacks content verification for the specific arguments required. Synthesis evaluation: The Milsom 2020 handbook represents the most thoroughly researched and verified candidate, with multiple independent confirmations of its focus on 19th-century (Romantic period) violin performance practices and academic credibility through Cambridge/Boydell Press publication. Final validation confirms 2020 as the publication year with highest confidence level based on convergent evidence from two independent research paths.
