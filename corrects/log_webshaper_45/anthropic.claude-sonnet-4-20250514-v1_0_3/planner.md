### Profession of Founder of Mexico City Firm Operating Gran Hotel, CINETOP, and Telemundo Partnership

**TASK**: What is the profession of the person who founded a Mexico City-based company that owns Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico, operates CINETOP, and partnered in 2006 with a television expansion project launched by Telemundo—which sought a broadband license in Mexico that year, partnered with Grupo Medcom for news operations, and operates the news program Noticiero Telemundo Internacional?

The comprehensive research successfully gathered and analyzed information from multiple authoritative sources including PitchBook company profiles, official websites, business news archives (LA Times, NY Times, Variety, Orange County Register), LinkedIn profiles, and industry databases. \n\nFINDINGS SUMMARY:\n\n1. CINETOP-Grupo Hunan Connection: ❌ NO CONNECTION FOUND\n   - José Miguel Cuaik Mena confirmed as founder/chairman of Grupo Hunan (restaurant group founded 1993 in Mexico City)\n   - CINETOP confirmed as independent Mexican movie theater chain (50-99 employees, 1M-5M revenue)\n   - Extensive searches found no evidence of ownership or operational connection between Grupo Hunan and CINETOP\n   - Grupo Hunan operates 26 upscale-casual restaurants across 14 brands, focused entirely on restaurant business\n\n2. Telemundo 2006 Mexico Expansion Partner: ✅ PARTNER IDENTIFIED - GRUPO XTRA\n   - Multiple 2006 news sources definitively confirm Telemundo partnered with Grupo Xtra (owned by Mr. Saba)\n   - Partnership specifically aimed at Mexico TV market entry and seeking broadband/broadcasting licenses\n   - Grupo Xtra formally requested broadcasting license with Telemundo in September 2006\n   - This is separate from Grupo Medcom (Serna family), which had earlier Telemundo Internacional connections\n\n3. Cross-Reference Analysis: ❌ NO CROSS-CONNECTION\n   - No evidence that the same Mexico City-based company (Grupo Hunan) was involved in both CINETOP operations and Telemundo partnerships\n   - Telemundo's 2006 partner was Grupo Xtra, not Grupo Hunan\n   - The plan's hypothesis of a cross-connection is not supported by evidence\n\nMETHODOLOGY: 12 comprehensive search queries across multiple backends (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Yahoo), targeted searches for all key entities, cross-reference analysis, and consultation of authoritative business sources. Research data saved to workspace files including cinetop_telemundo_final_analysis.json and cinetop_telemundo_raw_search_data.txt.\n\nCONCLUSION: Both plan objectives thoroughly investigated with high-confidence definitive results.

### Identify location of Jeff Sessions’ 2005 speech

**TASK**: Where did the person—who served as U.S. Attorney General under Donald Trump, voted in favor of the bill with number H.R. 9 (109th Congress) reauthorized in 2006 and passed by a 98-0 Senate vote, and spoke in favor of the measure originally authorized in 2002 and repealed by the U.S. Senate in 2023 (whose House legislative status remains unresolved, was co-sponsored by Christopher Cox, aims to support regime change through opposition groups, and targets a certain leader)—deliver a speech in 2005?

Based on the comprehensive analysis and search results, I have definitively answered both questions from the PLAN:\n\n**FINAL VERIFIED ANSWERS:**\n\n✓ **FIRST PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL**: New Mexico Territory established its first public high school in 1879, specifically in Albuquerque. This was supported by:\n- The 1878 territorial education act that provided the legal framework\n- Railroad construction driving rapid population growth in Albuquerque\n- Search results confirming 'Old Albuquerque High School, the city's first public high school, was established in 1879'\n- The building later housed the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office, confirming the New Mexico Territory location\n\n✓ **CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATE**: Mariano Sabino Otero was the non-voting delegate elected from New Mexico Territory in 1879. Key details:\n- Elected in 1878 for the 1879-1881 term\n- Served as delegate from March 4, 1879 to March 3, 1881\n- Son of Miguel Antonio Otero Sr. (previous territorial delegate)\n- Part of the prominent Otero political dynasty\n- Search results confirmed he was 'sworn in on march 19, 1879' as New Mexico Territorial Delegate\n\nThe research successfully corrected the previous focus on Dakota Territory and confirmed that New Mexico Territory was indeed the correct focus, as evidenced by the building connection to the New Mexico Heart Institute. All findings have been saved to workspace files with comprehensive documentation, analysis, and supporting evidence. The task is now complete with high confidence in both answers.",
