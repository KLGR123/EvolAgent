# Developer Plan #3 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** c365c1c7-a3db-4d5e-a9a1-66f56eae7865  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 3  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-02 10:01:31

## Plan Content
```
Determine the westernmost and easternmost birthplace_city values from workspace/presidents_birth_geocoded.csv by selecting the rows with the minimum and maximum longitude, then sort those two city names alphabetically and provide the result as a comma-separated list.
```

## Plan Description
```
This step is necessary because: (1) The enriched CSV with latitude and longitude is now available, (2) The TASK requires identification of the farthest-apart birth cities by longitude, (3) Expected outcome is the two city names—one at the minimum longitude (westernmost) and one at the maximum longitude (easternmost)—sorted alphabetically, (4) This directly produces the final answer requested by the TASK.

### Development Step 26: Determine Cities of Santa Clara University and UMass Boston, Ordered West to East

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- University admissions analytics dashboard uses the generated westernmost/easternmost city list to prioritize regional recruitment efforts on the U.S. West and East Coasts
- Campus tour coordination team integrates the comma-separated city output to optimize cross-country travel itineraries for prospective student visits
- National educational marketing agency leverages the extremal city pair to segment digital ad campaigns targeting Santa Clara and Boston areas
- Academic geographers incorporate the identified coastal extremity cities into research on longitudinal distribution of U.S. higher education institutions
- State education departments embed the script’s result in resource allocation reports to ensure support spans from California to Massachusetts campuses
- Higher ed data warehousing teams automate weekly operational dashboards by including the westernmost/easternmost university cities
- GIS developers feed the comma-separated city pair into mapping APIs to visualize nationwide university network coverage extremes

### Development Step 24: Cities of Westernmost and Easternmost Universities: Santa Clara University, UMass Boston

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- University admissions geospatial outreach optimization by automatically identifying the westernmost and easternmost campuses (Santa Clara, Boston) for region-specific marketing materials
- Logistics planning for shipping orientation kits to farthest-west and farthest-east university locations, ensuring efficient routing and cost estimates
- Campus tour mobile app backend setup that uses the two boundary cities to generate full cross-country campus visit itineraries
- Academic research on longitudinal diversity trends using the script to pinpoint geographic extremes among participating universities
- Marketing team regional ad spend allocation by targeting student populations at the westernmost and easternmost campuses
- Data science course demonstration of real-world CSV parsing and coordinate-based sorting, using university longitude data as the example
- State education department reporting tool to visualize the geographic spread of public universities, highlighting Santa Clara and Boston as boundary cases

We try common column name variations: 'longitude', 'Longitude', 'birth_longitude' for longitude and 'birthplace_city', 'birth_city', 'city' for the city.\n4) We convert longitude to float and maintain two trackers: min_long/min_city for the westernmost and max_long/max_city for the easternmost.\n5) After processing, we print the extremes and then sort the two city names alphabetically as required.\n6) The final comma-separated string is saved to workspace/birthplace_cities_sorted.txt for downstream consumption and printed to console for tester verification.\n\nThis advances the plan by fully automating the extraction of westernmost and easternmost birthplace cities, sorting them alphabetically, and persisting the output. It also includes the initial inspection step to accommodate unknown column names as recommended.
