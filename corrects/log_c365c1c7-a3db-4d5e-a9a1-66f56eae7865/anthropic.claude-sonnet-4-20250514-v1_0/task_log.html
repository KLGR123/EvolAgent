Of the universities that these bachelor&#x27;s degrees were from, which is the westernmost university and which is the easternmost university?

Use reliable government sources or authoritative websites for this information.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify which individuals formally held the position of United States Secretary of Homeland Security before April 2019, excluding acting secretaries, (2) No previous searches or information gathering has been done yet, (3) Expected outcome is a complete and accurate list of relevant secretaries that we can use for further research, (4) This directly addresses the first component of our task which requires identifying these specific individuals&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The task has already been successfully completed according to the tester&#x27;s feedback in the HISTORY. The solution correctly identified and listed all six U.S. Secretaries of Homeland Security who served prior to April 2019, excluding those who served in acting capacity only. The final implementation successfully accessed authoritative sources and provided a verified list of secretaries with their term dates, presidents they served under, and additional relevant notes. The data was properly formatted and saved to a JSON file in the workspace directory. As confirmed in the tester feedback, all PLAN requirements have been fully satisfied, so no further implementation is needed.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &quot;Search for the complete list of United States Secretaries of Homeland Security who served prior to April 2019 (excluding acting secretaries) and identify their educational backgrounds, specifically focusing on where each secretary obtained their bachelor&#x27;s degree.&quot;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify all formal Secretaries of Homeland Security before April 2019, (2) The HISTORY indicates we&#x27;ve started this research but need to focus specifically on their educational backgrounds, (3) Expected outcome is a complete list of these secretaries with their bachelor&#x27;s degree information, (4) This directly addresses the first requirement of the TASK to determine the universities where these individuals received their bachelor&#x27;s degrees.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The task has been successfully completed. The code identified the six US Secretaries of Homeland Security who served before April 2019 (excluding acting secretaries) and successfully extracted their bachelor&#x27;s degree information.\n\nHere&#x27;s a summary of the results:\n\n1. Tom Ridge: Harvard University (BA)\n2. Michael Chertoff: Harvard University (BA)\n3. Janet Napolitano: Santa Clara University (BS)\n4. Jeh Johnson: Morehouse College (BA)\n5. John F. Kelly: University of Massachusetts Boston (BA)\n6. Kirstjen Nielsen: Georgetown University (BS)\n\nThe final approach used a direct hardcoded list of secretaries since the Wikipedia table parsing proved unreliable. The bachelor&#x27;s degree extraction was improved with more sophisticated pattern matching techniques that successfully identified all degrees.\n\nThe code achieved all the requirements of the PLAN, identifying both the secretaries who served prior to April 2019 and their educational backgrounds with a focus on where they received their bachelor&#x27;s degrees.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &quot;Research the geographic locations of all universities where former US Secretaries of Homeland Security (who served prior to April 2019, excluding acting secretaries) obtained their bachelor&#x27;s degrees. Identify the longitude and latitude coordinates for each university to determine which is the westernmost and which is the easternmost.&quot;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is the optimal next step because: (1) We&#x27;ve already identified all six formal Secretaries and their bachelor&#x27;s degree universities, (2) The previous developer work confirmed these universities as Harvard (Ridge, Chertoff), Santa Clara University, Morehouse College, University of Massachusetts Boston, and Georgetown University, (3) Expected outcome is the geographic coordinates of each university to determine westernmost and easternmost locations, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK requirement of identifying the westernmost and easternmost universities by city location.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;The task has already been successfully completed. Based on the HISTORY, the code has been implemented and executed without any critical errors. The script successfully researched the geographic locations of universities where former US Secretaries of Homeland Security obtained their bachelor\&#x27;s degrees, identified the coordinates for each university, and determined that Santa Clara University (attended by Janet Napolitano) is the westernmost university at longitude -121.936544 and University of Massachusetts Boston (attended by John F. Kelly) is the easternmost university at longitude -71.0387132. All results were properly saved to JSON and CSV files. According to the tester\&#x27;s feedback in the last execution, &quot;The PLAN requirements have been completely met, and no further development is needed.&quot;&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This step is necessary because: (1) We&#x27;ve already identified Santa Clara University as the westernmost university and University of Massachusetts Boston as the easternmost university from previous research, (2) The HISTORY shows we have their coordinates but need to explicitly identify their city locations, (3) Expected outcome is the names of the cities where these universities are located, (4) The TASK specifically requests a comma-separated list of city names rather than university names, with westernmost first.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;Based on the HISTORY, the task has been successfully completed. Through multiple successful script executions, we\&#x27;ve consistently confirmed that Santa Clara University (longitude -121.936544) is the westernmost university and University of Massachusetts Boston (longitude -71.0387132) is the easternmost university.\n\nThe required comma-separated list with the westernmost city first, followed by the easternmost city, is &quot;Santa Clara, Boston&quot;. This result has been properly verified and saved to workspace/university_cities.txt in the most recent execution.\n\nThe PLAN has been fully implemented with the correct result produced and saved to the specified location. No further development is needed as confirmed by the tester\&#x27;s feedback.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. Based on our research, we identified all individuals who formally held the position of United States secretary of homeland security prior to April 2019 (excluding acting secretaries): Tom Ridge, Michael Chertoff, Janet Napolitano, Jeh Johnson, John F. Kelly, and Kirstjen Nielsen. We determined their bachelor&#x27;s degree institutions and locations: Harvard University (Ridge, Chertoff), Santa Clara University (Napolitano), Morehouse College (Johnson), University of Massachusetts Boston (Kelly), and Georgetown University (Nielsen).

I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won&#x27;t buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here&#x27;s the list I have so far:<br><br>milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts<br><br>I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won&#x27;t get them when she&#x27;s at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.<br><br>```<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;Task completed successfully.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution failed - NameError when trying to call &#x27;get_presidents_birth_data&#x27; function. The code has a structural issue where the main() function is trying to call get_presidents_birth_data() but this function is defined after the main() function call at the bottom of the script. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called. The error occurred because when main() executes, get_presidents_birth_data() hasn&#x27;t been defined yet in the execution context. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no data processing completed due to function definition order issue. Recommended fix: Move the &#x27;if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: main()&#x27; block to the very end of the file, after all function definitions, or restructure the code so all functions are defined before main() is called.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution failed - NameError when trying to call &#x27;get_presidents_birth_data&#x27; function. The code has the same structural issue as the previous attempt: the main() function is being called before all the required functions are properly defined in the execution context. The error occurs at line 553 in main() when it tries to call get_presidents_birth_data(), but the function definitions are not accessible at execution time. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no data compilation or file creation completed due to function definition order issue. Recommended fix: The &#x27;if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: main()&#x27; execution block needs to be moved to the very end of the file, after all function definitions (get_presidents_birth_data, analyze_birth_locations, save_results, display_results, and main). This is a simple code organization issue that prevents the comprehensive presidential birth city research from running.

The script successfully compiled a comprehensive list of all 46 U.S. Presidents with their birth cities, analyzed birth location patterns, and generated detailed output showing Virginia leads with 8 presidents, followed by Ohio with 7, and New York with 5. The code created three output files in the workspace directory: JSON dataset, CSV for spreadsheet analysis, and formatted text summary. All birth location data appears accurate and includes specific cities/counties within U.S. states as required. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - comprehensive historical data on presidential birth cities has been successfully researched and compiled from reliable sources. The output is quite lengthy and contains valuable research results, so the data has already been appropriately saved to workspace files for future reference. No further development is needed.

The output shows the file contains 46 presidents with complete birth location data including city, state, and full location strings. The data structure is well-organized with each president having &#x27;birth_city&#x27;, &#x27;birth_state&#x27;, and &#x27;birth_location_full&#x27; fields that can be used for geocoding. **PLAN** alignment: 20% complete - data inspection phase successful, but the main objectives remain: (1) obtain geographic coordinates for each birth city, (2) identify westernmost and easternmost cities by longitude, and (3) calculate great circle distance between the extreme points. Next steps: Use a geocoding service (like geopy) to get latitude/longitude coordinates for each unique birth location, then perform the longitude analysis and distance calculations.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed all **PLAN** requirements. The geocoding process successfully obtained coordinates for 44 out of 45 presidents (only Andrew Jackson&#x27;s disputed location failed), identified Barack Obama&#x27;s birth city (Honolulu, Hawaii) as the westernmost point at longitude -157.855676 and John Adams&#x27; birth city (Braintree, Massachusetts) as the easternmost point at longitude -71.004123, and calculated the great circle distance between these extreme points as 5,086.50 miles (8,185.93 kilometers). The code properly handled rate limiting, error cases, and saved comprehensive results to &#x27;presidential_birth_cities_analysis.json&#x27;. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all objectives achieved including coordinate determination, longitude-based extremes identification, and great circle distance calculation. No further development is needed.
