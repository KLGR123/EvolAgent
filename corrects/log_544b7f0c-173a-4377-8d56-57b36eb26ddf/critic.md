## Final Answer
```
A Nightmare on Elm Street
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the specific horror movie cited by Valentina Re in her contribution to the 2017 book 'World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries' as having popularized metalepsis between dream world and reality, with complete name including article if any. All three members conducted comprehensive academic literature searches and reached identical conclusions through different methodological approaches. Member 1 employed systematic constraint mapping with Google Books API and Amsterdam University Press sources, successfully identifying Valentina Re's chapter 'From Narrative Levels to Boundaries: Metalepsis in Film' and extracting the specific horror movie citation. Member 2 used multi-database academic search across Google Scholar, Crossref, and arXiv, yielding 158 results with 91 unique entries, confirming Re's chapter and identifying the same horror film through theoretical analysis of metalepsis concepts. Member 3 conducted the most extensive research with 126 unique academic papers across multiple databases, initially exploring TV series but correctly pivoting to focus on horror films, ultimately providing 95% confidence identification through academic consensus methodology. Convergence analysis: All three members independently reached 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' as the final answer, with strong agreement on the theoretical justification - Freddy Krueger's ability to transgress ontological boundaries between dream and reality worlds represents the quintessential example of metalepsis in horror cinema. Cross-validation through multiple academic sources confirms this 1984 Wes Craven film as the standard scholarly citation for popularizing this narrative technique. Synthesis validation: The convergence across three independent research approaches with different databases and methodologies provides high confidence in accuracy. Final answer format compliance verified: 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' includes the required article 'A' as specified in the task.
