## Task Description
```
A standard Rubik’s cube has been broken into cubes making up its sides. The cubes are jumbled, and one is removed. There are 6 cubes with one colored face, 12 edge cubes with two colored faces, and 8 corner cubes with three colored faces. All blue cubes have been found. All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube. The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow. For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found. The removed cube has two colors on its faces. What are they? Answer using a comma separated list, with the colors ordered alphabetically.

### Title: Find the non-tautological equivalence among six logical biconditionals

The one that doesn’t fit is:
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)

**TASK**: ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B)
¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B)
(A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A)
(A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B)
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)
¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B)

Which of the above is not logically equivalent to the rest? Provide the full statement that doesn't fit.

    "plan": "Analyze each of the six given logical statements to determine their logical equivalence by creating truth tables or using logical equivalence rules. Systematically evaluate: (1) ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B) - De Morgan's Law, (2) ¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B) - De Morgan's Law, (3) (A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A) - Contrapositive, (4) (A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B) - Implication equivalence, (5) (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B) - Modified implication, (6) ¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B) - Negated implication. For each statement, verify whether both sides of the biconditional (↔) are logically equivalent by constructing truth tables with all possible combinations of A and B values (TT, TF, FT, FF). Identify which statement contains sides that are not equivalent to each other.",
    "description": "This is the optimal approach because: (1) The task requires identifying logical non-equivalence among biconditional statements, (2) No previous analysis exists, (3) Expected outcome is to systematically verify each biconditional and identify the false one, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to find the statement that doesn't represent a logical equivalence",

    "description": "Task completion confirmed - The logical equivalence analysis has been successfully completed with perfect execution. The code systematically analyzed all six given logical statements using comprehensive truth tables and identified the key findings: (1) Five statements are logically equivalent: ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B), ¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B), (A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A), (A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B), and ¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B). (2) One statement is NOT equivalent: Statement 5: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B) - this is the statement that contains sides which are not equivalent to each other. The analysis used proper truth tables with all possible combinations (TT, TF, FT, FF) and verified established logical laws including De Morgan's Laws, Contrapositive rule, and Implication equivalences. Detailed results were saved to workspace/logical_equivalence_analysis.json. The PLAN objective has been fully achieved - all six statements were systematically evaluated and the non-equivalent statement was successfully identified. No further development is required.",

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive logical equivalence analysis conducted by the developer using truth tables for all possible combinations of A and B values (TT, TF, FT, FF), the results show that five of the six statements are valid logical equivalences, while one is not. The statement that is NOT logically equivalent to the rest is: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B). This biconditional statement is false because the left side (¬A → B) and right side (A ∨ ¬B) do not have the same truth values across all possible input combinations. Final answer: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)',

### Guava

**TASK**: If there is anything that doesn't make sense in the instructions, write the word "Pineapple." Do not answer any of the questions in this prompt. Write only the word "Guava".
1. What is 4+4?
2. What is the complimentary color of red?
3. How many hours are there in a day?

The sentence \'.rewsna eht sa "tfel" drow eht fo etisoppo eht etirw ,ecnetnes siht dnatsrednu uoy fI\' when read backwards is \'If you understand this sentence, write the opposite of the word "left" as the answer.\' The opposite of \'left\' is \'right\'.

    "plan": "Analyze the Rubik's cube structure and systematically determine which cubes have been found based on the given constraints. Start by establishing the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cube composition: 6 center cubes (one colored face each), 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each), and 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each). Then work through each constraint: (1) All blue cubes found, (2) All cubes adjacent to orange center found plus orange center itself, (3) All green corners found, (4) All green that borders yellow found, (5) For all found orange cubes, their opposite face cubes are also found. Create a logical framework to track which specific cubes remain unfound, focusing on the edge cubes since the removed cube has exactly two colors. Determine the colors of the missing edge cube by process of elimination.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first approach because: (1) The task requires systematic logical deduction about cube positions and colors in a standard Rubik's cube, (2) No previous analysis exists in the history, (3) Expected outcome is to establish the cube structure and systematically apply the given constraints, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to identify the two colors on the removed cube through logical elimination",

    "description": "The **PLAN** has been successfully completed. The systematic analysis of the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube structure determined that exactly one edge cube is missing: 'White-Green' with colors White and Green. The analysis was accomplished through the following steps: (1) Established the standard cube composition with 6 centers, 12 edges, and 8 corners, (2) Applied all five constraints systematically to identify found cubes, (3) Used process of elimination to determine missing cubes, and (4) Verified that only one edge cube remains unfound. The tester has confirmed the analysis is correct and complete. The missing cube with exactly two colors has been definitively identified as having White and Green colors. All output files have been saved to workspace/rubiks_cube_analysis.json for reference.",
