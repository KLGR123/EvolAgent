## Final Answer
```
1838
```

## True Answer
```
Emma Cons was born in 1838
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the birth year of the founder of an organization that developed Surrey Lodge in South London during the Victorian era, with specific characteristics including temperance hall transformation, UK's first rotating stage (1935), WWII bomb damage, and company relocation to Burnley. Member 0 evaluation: Conducted systematic research identifying Surrey Lodge No 266 as part of the United Ancient Order of Druids (UAOD), founded by Henry Hurle in 1739. However, this approach conflated a Druidic lodge organization with the actual venue development - the UAOD operated lodges as meeting places, not property development companies. The connection to Surrey Lodge as a physical venue with temperance hall transformation appears misaligned with Druidic organizational structure. Member 1 evaluation: Identified Emma Cons (born 1838) as founder of South London Dwellings Company, with comprehensive verification of Surrey Lodge's Victorian development, temperance hall status, rotating stage installation, and WWII damage. Research methodology was thorough with 88.9% requirement fulfillment, though Burnley relocation remained unconfirmed. Emma Cons was a documented Victorian housing reformer with strong South London connections. Member 2 evaluation: Also identified Octavia Hill (born 1838) as the founder, with extensive biographical verification achieving 99% confidence on birth year. Research confirmed Hill's role as prominent Victorian housing reformer working in South London's Lambeth area from 1864, with documented connections to housing management companies and temperance movement. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on 1838 birth year between Members 1 and 2, despite identifying different founders (Emma Cons vs Octavia Hill). Both were legitimate Victorian housing reformers active in South London. Member 0's 1739 date represents a fundamentally different organizational type. Divergence resolution: The Emma Cons/Octavia Hill discrepancy reflects the complex Victorian housing reform movement where multiple reformers worked collaboratively. Both had documented South London activities and housing company involvement. However, Member 2's research provided more comprehensive verification methodology and stronger confidence levels in founder identification. Integration assessment: Member 2 demonstrated superior analytical rigor with systematic verification processes, comprehensive biographical research, and appropriate confidence level assessments. The 1838 birth year is supported by two independent research paths, representing the most reliable conclusion.
