Based on the comprehensive research conducted in the HISTORY, the original TASK premise contained a factual error - Arthur Morris never scored over 300 runs in any Test innings (his highest was 206). The research corrected this and identified that Don Bradman scored the first 300+ run Test innings (334 runs against England at Leeds in 1930), with Bill Woodfull as the Australian captain in that match. Further research confirmed that Bill Woodfull passed away on August 11, 1965, at age 67 in Tweed Heads, New South Wales, Australia. Final answer: 1965.',

Evidence summary: (1) Kirk Gibson became interim manager of Arizona Diamondbacks on July 1, 2010, exactly matching the July 2010 timeframe specified in the PLAN, (2) Gibson has strong Detroit Tigers connections as a former player (1979-1987, 1993-1995) and coach (2003-2005), fulfilling the Detroit Tigers retired number holder connection requirement, (3) Gibson wore #23 for Detroit Tigers and has retired number context (though #23 was later retired for Willie Horton), (4) Gibson was speculated as Jim Leyland's replacement when Leyland stepped down as Tigers manager, creating the connection to Jim Leyland mentioned in the PLAN. The specific searches for Sparky Anderson, Jim Leyland, and Mickey Cochrane confirmed that none of these managers had interim manager roles in July 2010.
