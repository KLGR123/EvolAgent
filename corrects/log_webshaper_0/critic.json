  "reason": "Task decomposition: Identify the team that won 10 consecutive DDR-Oberliga titles (1978-1988), locate their August 16, 1986 opening match venue, and determine attendance figures. All three members correctly identified BFC Dynamo as the dominant team through comprehensive web searches with consistent methodology and evidence validation. However, critical divergence emerged in attendance figures: Members 1 and 2 both reported 12,000 spectators at Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, while Member 3 reported 22,000 spectators at Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum. Cross-analysis reveals Members 1 and 2 achieved convergence through independent research paths, both citing Transfermarkt match reports with identical specific details: 'Aug 16, 1986 12:00 AM 4:1 (1:0) Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark | Attendance: 12.000 Referee: Dr. Klaus Scheurell'. Member 3's solitary Wikipedia reference lacks the detailed verification found in Members 1 and 2's multi-source confirmation. Evidence evaluation shows Members 1 and 2 provided more comprehensive source validation with match-specific details including referee information, half-time score, and venue confirmation. The 2-to-1 consensus, combined with more detailed source documentation and cross-verification between independent research approaches, strongly supports 12,000 as the accurate attendance figure. Final validation confirms Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark as the correct venue (sports complex with multiple facilities) and 12,000 spectators as the definitive attendance count.",
