### Multi-Approach Mathematical Problem Analysis

**Scenario**: Team members solve a complex calculation with different methodologies.

```json
{
    "role": "critic", 
    "final_answer": "157.42",
    "reason": "Task analysis: Calculate compound interest with variable rates over multiple periods, requiring precision to two decimal places. Member 0 used iterative calculation with proper compounding but made rounding errors in intermediate steps, achieving 157.38. Member 1 employed logarithmic transformation approach with correct mathematical foundation, reaching 157.42 with proper precision handling. Member 2 used approximation method suitable for estimation but insufficient for required precision, yielding 157.5. Cross-analysis reveals Member 1's logarithmic approach provides highest mathematical rigor and accuracy. Convergence analysis shows all members understood core compound interest concept, but diverged on precision handling. Integration assessment: Member 1's methodology is most reliable, with verification through alternative calculation confirming 157.42 as correct answer. Final validation through independent recalculation supports this result with confidence level: high.",

### Complex Research and Analysis Task

**Scenario**: Team researches market data with different information gathering strategies.

```json
{
    "role": "critic",
    "final_answer": "23.7",
    "reason": "Task decomposition: Determine quarterly market growth percentage based on multiple data sources, requiring thorough research and statistical analysis. Member 0 conducted comprehensive web search across financial databases, gathering 15 data points from reliable sources, calculating 23.7% through weighted average methodology - demonstrated strong research depth and statistical rigor. Member 1 focused on official regulatory filings with 8 high-quality data points, reaching 24.1% using simple average approach - showed excellent source credibility but limited data breadth. Member 2 used mixed methodology combining news sources and financial reports, achieving 23.4% but with some questionable source reliability. Convergence analysis: All members identified similar market trends and directional growth, with results clustering around 23-24% range. Divergence examination: Differences stem from data source selection and averaging methodology rather than fundamental disagreements. Synthesis evaluation: Member 0's approach combines optimal source diversity with sophisticated statistical treatment. Integration validation: Cross-referencing Member 0's data points with Member 1's regulatory sources confirms accuracy. Final answer 23.7% represents most methodologically sound and comprehensively supported result.",

### Problem-Solving Strategy Evaluation

**Scenario**: Team tackles multi-step logical reasoning challenge with different strategic approaches.

```json
{
    "role": "critic",
    "final_answer": "A, C, B, D, E",
    "reason": "Task analysis: Solve complex sequencing problem requiring logical deduction, pattern recognition, and constraint satisfaction. Member 0 used systematic constraint mapping approach, identifying all rules correctly and applying logical elimination methodically - produced sequence A, C, B, D, E with clear step-by-step justification and validation checks. Member 1 employed intuitive pattern recognition followed by verification, reaching same sequence but with less rigorous intermediate steps and some logical gaps in explanation. Member 2 used trial-and-error methodology with partial success, identifying correct first three elements (A, C, B) but failing to properly sequence final elements due to constraint oversight. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on initial sequence elements with divergence in final positioning logic. Agreement assessment: Members 0 and 1 reached identical final answer through different but valid approaches. Contradiction resolution: Member 2's error stems from incomplete constraint consideration rather than fundamental methodological flaws. Synthesis evaluation: Member 0's systematic approach provides highest reliability and educational value, demonstrating complete mastery of logical reasoning requirements. Integration confidence: Multiple verification methods confirm A, C, B, D, E as definitively correct sequence.",
