### Where was the author of "Francia’s Reign of Terror" and an 1839 rural novel born?

**TASK**: According to the text, in which place was the author born who wrote both the collection of letters titled "Francia's Reign of Terror"—the third volume that documents a four-year stay under Dictator Francia's rule, criticizes local laziness and government policies, and was written while relying on local hospitality—and a novel published by Saunders and Otley in 1839? This novel, set in rural Scotland and Wales, features a young orphan clerk residing in Glasgow and was illustrated by an artist known for illustrating Charles Dickens' works, who also created an illustration titled "The Great 100 Rat Match" circa 1858.
