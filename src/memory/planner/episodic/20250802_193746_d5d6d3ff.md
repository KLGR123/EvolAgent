Research Hreidmar's sons (Fafnir, Regin, and Otr) to determine which one has a journal named after them, then locate Midkiff's specific article from June 2014 that discusses dragon depictions and contains quotes from two different authors expressing distaste.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify both the specific journal and the article before finding the quoted word, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the journal name (likely related to Fafnir, Regin, or Otr from Norse mythology) and Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article, (4) This establishes the foundation for finding the specific word quoted from two authors regarding dragon depictions",
