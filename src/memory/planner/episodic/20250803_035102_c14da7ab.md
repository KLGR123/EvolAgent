### Newton’s Method on x^3+4x^2−3x+8 from x₀=−5: Iterations to Four-Decimal Stability

**TASK**: Given $x_0 = -5$ and $f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 8$, what is the smallest $n$ where using Newton's Method $n = n+1$ after rounding to four decimal places?

    "plan": "Implement Newton's Method for the function f(x) = x³ + 4x² - 3x + 8 starting with x₀ = -5. Calculate the derivative f'(x) = 3x² + 8x - 3 and apply the iterative formula xₙ₊₁ = xₙ - f(xₙ)/f'(xₙ). Continue iterations until finding the smallest n where xₙ = xₙ₊₁ when both values are rounded to four decimal places. Track each iteration's values and identify when convergence occurs at the specified precision level.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to implement Newton's Method with the given function and initial value to find convergence, (2) No previous calculations have been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the iteration number where consecutive values become identical when rounded to four decimal places, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement to find the smallest n where the Newton's Method iterations converge at four decimal place precision.",

    "description": "The Newton's Method implementation has been successfully completed and fully satisfies all PLAN requirements. The code correctly implemented the iterative formula x_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n) for the function f(x) = x³ + 4x² - 3x + 8 with derivative f'(x) = 3x² + 8x - 3, starting from x₀ = -5. \n\nKey results achieved:\n- Successfully applied Newton's Method with proper mathematical implementation\n- Tracked each iteration step with detailed calculations and progress monitoring\n- Identified convergence at step n = 2 where x_2 = x_3 = -4.9361 when rounded to 4 decimal places\n- Verified the convergent value as a good root approximation with f(-4.9361) ≈ 0.00014561\n- Provided comprehensive documentation and saved detailed results to workspace/newtons_method_final_results.txt\n\nThe final answer to the PLAN question is definitively established: **n = 2** is the smallest value where x_n = x_(n+1) when both values are rounded to four decimal places. The implementation executed without errors, achieved 100% PLAN alignment, and provided complete mathematical verification of the convergence criteria. No further development is required as all objectives have been successfully met.",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive Newton's Method implementation performed by the developer: (1) The iterative formula xₙ₊₁ = xₙ - f(xₙ)/f'(xₙ) was correctly applied to f(x) = x³ + 4x² - 3x + 8 with derivative f'(x) = 3x² + 8x - 3, starting from x₀ = -5, (2) The iterations were tracked until convergence was achieved at four decimal place precision, (3) At n = 2, both x₂ and x₃ rounded to -4.9361 when expressed to four decimal places, indicating convergence, (4) This represents the smallest n where xₙ = xₙ₊₁ after rounding to four decimal places as required. Final answer: n = 2",
