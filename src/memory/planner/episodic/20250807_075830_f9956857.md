    "plan": "Research the history of postal systems to identify the person who served as Postmaster General and introduced a postal system that first implemented scheduled delivery times and operated on turnpike roads. Focus on early postal system developments, particularly in countries known for pioneering organized mail delivery systems such as Britain, France, or early American postal services. Search for keywords including 'first scheduled postal delivery', 'turnpike road postal system', 'Postmaster General scheduled delivery times', and 'early postal system turnpike roads'.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific historical figure who introduced these postal innovations before determining their nationality, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the Postmaster General who pioneered scheduled delivery times on turnpike roads, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to then determine the nationality of this person as requested in the TASK',

    "description": "The PLAN has been successfully completed. The comprehensive research has definitively identified John Palmer as the person who introduced the first scheduled postal delivery system operating on turnpike roads in Britain on August 2, 1784. The research thoroughly addresses all PLAN requirements: (1) Researched the history of postal systems with focus on early developments in Britain, France, and America, (2) Identified the key figure - John Palmer - who worked with postal authorities to implement this revolutionary system, (3) Documented the implementation of scheduled delivery times with precise, published timetables that were revolutionary for the time, (4) Confirmed the specific use of turnpike road infrastructure for reliability and speed, (5) Covered all requested search keywords including 'first scheduled postal delivery', 'turnpike road postal system', 'Postmaster General scheduled delivery times', and 'early postal system turnpike roads'. The research data is comprehensively saved in workspace/postal_history_research.json with detailed analysis of key historical figures (Palmer, Franklin, Allen), turnpike roads context, and complete evidence supporting Palmer as the innovator who reduced London-Bath delivery time from 38 to 16 hours through systematic scheduling. While Palmer wasn't technically titled 'Postmaster General', he was the definitive figure who introduced scheduled delivery on turnpike roads, working with postal authorities to create the foundation for modern postal scheduling systems worldwide. The research is complete, verified, and documented.",
