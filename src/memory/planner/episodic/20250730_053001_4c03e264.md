    "plan": "Search for the book with DOI 10.1353/book.24372 to identify the title, author, and subject neurologist. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Direct DOI resolution through doi.org, (2) Academic database searches using the DOI, (3) Google Scholar search with the DOI string, (4) Publisher database searches focusing on the '10.1353' prefix which typically indicates Project MUSE publications. Extract complete bibliographic information including title, author, publication year, publisher, and any available abstract or description that identifies which neurologist the book concerns.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific book and its subject neurologist before accessing chapter 2, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the book's bibliographic details and subject identification, (4) This establishes the foundation for locating and analyzing chapter 2 content about 'endopsychic myths' and the influencing author",
