    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": "Search for Nedoshivina's 2010 scientific paper that includes descriptions of Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov. Focus on finding the complete publication with methods/materials sections or specimen repository information. Use these search approaches: (1) Academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or ResearchGate using keywords 'Nedoshivina 2010 Vietnamese specimens Kuznetzov', (2) Taxonomic databases that might reference specimen deposits, (3) Journal archives that published the paper in 2010. Look specifically for sections mentioning specimen deposition, museum collections, or institutional repositories where the Vietnamese materials were stored.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to locate the specific 2010 paper by Nedoshivina that mentions Kuznetzov's Vietnamese specimens, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the publication and identify specimen repository information, (4) This directly targets finding the deposition location mentioned in the paper",
