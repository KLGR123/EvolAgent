### Decrypt Caesar Cipher to Reveal Picnic Meeting Location

**TASK**: This is a secret message my friend gave me. It says where we should meet for our picnic on Friday. The only problem is, it’s encrypted in the Caesar cipher, so I can’t read it. Can you tell me what it says? This is the message:

Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.

```

    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": "Decrypt the Caesar cipher message 'Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.' by testing different shift values to find the correct decryption that reveals a readable English location for the picnic meeting place.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal approach because: (1) We have a Caesar cipher encrypted message that needs decryption to reveal the picnic location, (2) No previous decryption attempts have been made, (3) Expected outcome is to find the correct shift value and decode the message into readable English text, (4) This directly solves the TASK by revealing where the friends should meet for their Friday picnic',

    "description": "The Caesar cipher decryption task has been completed successfully! The code systematically tested all 25 possible shift values and identified the correct decryption with shift value 10. The encrypted message 'Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.' decrypts to 'Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.' - a clear, readable English sentence that reveals the picnic meeting location. The analysis correctly identified this as the most likely candidate with a readability score of 12, containing recognizable English words 'picnic', 'is', 'in', and 'plaza'. The results have been saved to workspace files (picnic_location.txt and all_caesar_results.txt) for reference. The PLAN objective has been 100% achieved - the Caesar cipher has been successfully decrypted and the readable English location 'Polybius Plaza' has been definitively identified as the picnic meeting place.",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. The developer has already decrypted the Caesar cipher message 'Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.' by systematically testing all possible shift values and found that with a shift of 10, the message decodes to 'Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.' This clearly reveals the meeting location for the Friday picnic. Final answer: Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.",
