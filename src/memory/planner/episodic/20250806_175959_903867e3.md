### List Pre-2020 US Zip Codes for Invasive Clownfish Sightings

**TASK**: I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.

    "plan": 'Identify the main character fish species from the movie Finding Nemo and then search for USGS databases or reports documenting nonnative fish species occurrences in the United States before 2020. Focus on finding official USGS records that include specific location data with zip codes for where this species was found as an invasive or nonnative population.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to first confirm the fish species from Finding Nemo (likely clownfish/Amphiprioninae) and then locate USGS nonnative species databases, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this topic, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the target species and find USGS documentation of nonnative occurrences with geographic specificity, (4) This directly targets finding the zip code locations where the species was documented as nonnative before 2020 as requested in the TASK',

    "description": "PLAN objective has been successfully completed. The implementation achieved all required components: (1) Identified the main character fish species from Finding Nemo as Amphiprion ocellaris (clown anemonefish), (2) Successfully accessed the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Database and located species profile with ID 3243, (3) Found a documented nonnative occurrence record (Specimen ID: 1468741) from 2018 in Florida, which satisfies the 'before 2020' requirement, (4) Extracted specific location data including Pinellas County and Fred Howard Park locality that provides sufficient information for ZIP code identification (Holiday, FL area: ZIP codes 34690-34691). The final comprehensive analysis was saved to workspace/finding_nemo_clownfish_usgs_complete_analysis.json with complete documentation of the specimen record, location details, and ZIP code conversion potential. The USGS record confirms this was a managed nonnative population (status: eradicated), validating the nonnative species requirement. All PLAN objectives have been verified and documented with official USGS data sources.",

    "description": 'This is the necessary next step because: (1) The developer successfully identified the clownfish species and found the USGS nonnative occurrence record from 2018 in Florida, (2) The location data shows Pinellas County/Fred Howard Park/Holiday FL area with potential ZIP codes 34690-34691, but we need to verify the exact ZIP codes for the documented location, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the precise five-digit ZIP codes where the nonnative clownfish was found according to USGS records, (4) This completes the TASK by providing the required ZIP code format for the answer.',
