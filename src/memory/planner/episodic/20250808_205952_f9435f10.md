### **Title:**  
Find NASA Award Number Supporting R. G. Arendt in Paper Linked from June 6, 2023 Universe Today Article

**Answer:**  
The paper linked at the bottom of Carolyn Collins Petersen’s June 6, 2023 Universe Today article is:  
**"JWST NIRCam Observations of the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A"** by D. J. Patnaude et al. (arXiv:2306.03081).

In the acknowledgments section of the paper, it states:  
"R.G.A. was supported by an appointment to the NASA Postdoctoral Program at the Goddard Space Flight Center, administered by Oak Ridge Associated Universities under contract NPP 80GSFC21M0002."

**NASA award number:** **80GSFC21M0002**

**TASK**: On June 6, 2023, an article by Carolyn Collins Petersen was published in Universe Today. This article mentions a team that produced a paper about their observations, linked at the bottom of the article. Find this paper. Under what NASA award number was the work performed by R. G. Arendt supported by?
