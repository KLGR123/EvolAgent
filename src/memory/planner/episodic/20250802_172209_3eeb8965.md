### Identify weight and adjacent-column swap causing checksum errors in modified ISBN-13 numbers

**TASK**: The following numbers function similarly to ISBN 13 numbers, however, their validation methods are slightly different. Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

Implement the modified ISBN-13 validation algorithm that uses alternating weights of 1 and an unknown positive integer (less than 10) instead of the standard 1 and 3. Test all possible weight values (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and all possible adjacent column transposition positions (excluding the final column and first three columns as specified). For each combination of weight and transposition position, check if all 10 given numbers would be valid after correcting the transposition error. Return all valid solutions in the format 'x, y' where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We have 10 ISBN-13-like numbers with a modified validation system and known errors that need systematic analysis, (2) No previous analysis has been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to identify all valid combinations of unknown weight and transposed column positions that make all numbers valid, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK of finding the weight parameter and error location through comprehensive testing of all possibilities.',
