### Title: Find Longest Word on Boggle Board ABRL EITE IONS FPEI Using words_alpha Dictionary

**TASK**: I thought we could try a fun word puzzle together :)

I've got a Boggle board here:

ABRL
EITE
IONS
FPEI

I'd like to know the longest word that can be generated from the board. Please find the longest English language word that can be generated from this board. If more than one word of the same length exists at the maximum word length, please report the longest word that comes first, alphabetically. Oh, and I know that there might be different wordlists available for Boggle, so let's please just use the words_alpha dictionary found at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words as the dictionary for our game.

    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": 'Download the words_alpha dictionary from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words to workspace/words_alpha.txt and then implement a Boggle solver to find all valid words that can be formed from the given 4x4 board (ABRL/EITE/IONS/FPEI) using the downloaded dictionary. The solver should check all possible paths on the board where adjacent cells (including diagonally adjacent) can be visited exactly once per word, then identify the longest valid English word(s) and return the alphabetically first one if there are ties.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal approach because: (1) We need to solve a Boggle puzzle which requires both the specific dictionary and a pathfinding algorithm, (2) No previous work has been done on this task, (3) Expected outcome is to download the required dictionary and implement a complete Boggle solver that finds the longest valid word, (4) This directly addresses the TASK by using the specified word list and board configuration to find the longest possible English word.',

    "description": "The Boggle solver has been successfully completed and verified. The implementation successfully: (1) Downloaded the words_alpha dictionary from GitHub (370,105 words) to workspace/words_alpha.txt, (2) Loaded the dictionary into memory for O(1) lookup performance, (3) Set up the 4x4 Boggle board (ABRL/EITE/IONS/FPEI) as specified, (4) Implemented a class-based recursive depth-first search algorithm that explores all possible paths from each board position, (5) Correctly handled adjacency rules including diagonal neighbors with proper backtracking to visit each cell exactly once per word path, (6) Found 443 valid English words from the board in 8.91 seconds, (7) Identified the longest words as 8 letters long: 'briniest', 'brionies', 'inertiae', and 'pointrel', (8) Returned 'briniest' as the alphabetically first longest word, which is the correct final answer, (9) Saved complete results with detailed analysis to workspace/boggle_solver_results.txt. The class-based approach successfully resolved the function scope issues encountered in earlier attempts. The solver correctly implements Boggle rules and produces the expected result. **PLAN** is 100% complete with verified success.",
