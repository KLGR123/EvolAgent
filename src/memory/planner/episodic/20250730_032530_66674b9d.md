### Compute odds of today’s Sunset Picnic Trip using a steam locomotive

**TASK**: The attached file lists the locomotives owned by a local railroad museum. It gives each locomotive’s identifying number, operating status, and the name of the daily excursion it heads, if operational. What are the odds that today’s Sunset Picnic Trip will use a steam locomotive? Assume that each day’s excursion picks one of its assigned locomotives at random, and express the answer in the form “1 in 4”, “1 in 5”, etc. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/4d0aa727-86b1-406b-9b33-f870dd14a4a5.xlsx

Specifically identify all locomotives assigned to the 'Sunset Picnic Trip' and determine how many are steam locomotives versus other types to calculate the probability odds.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the Excel file structure and extract all locomotive data before calculating odds for the Sunset Picnic Trip, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete locomotive inventory with operational status and excursion assignments identified, (4) This provides the foundation needed to determine which locomotives serve the Sunset Picnic Trip and calculate the steam locomotive probability as requested in the TASK',

    "description": "Task completed successfully. The locomotive analysis has been fully executed according to the **PLAN** requirements. The Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/4d0aa727-86b1-406b-9b33-f870dd14a4a5.xlsx was parsed and analyzed to extract locomotive data including identification numbers, operating status, and daily excursion assignments. All locomotives assigned to the 'Sunset Picnic Trip' were successfully identified: locomotive #1060 (steam, 0-4-0 wheel configuration), locomotive #93 (diesel, NW2), and locomotive #57 (diesel, GP30). The locomotive types were correctly classified using wheel configuration patterns for steam locomotives and model designations for diesel locomotives. The probability analysis was completed showing 1 steam locomotive versus 2 diesel locomotives on the Sunset Picnic Trip, resulting in 33.3% probability for steam, 66.7% probability for diesel, with odds ratio of 1:2 (steam:diesel). Complete results including locomotive details, classification logic, and probability calculations were saved to workspace/sunset_picnic_locomotive_analysis.json. The tester confirmed execution was successful and all **PLAN** objectives were achieved with no further development needed.",

Based on the comprehensive analysis performed by the developer: (1) The Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/4d0aa727-86b1-406b-9b33-f870dd14a4a5.xlsx was successfully parsed to extract all locomotive data including identification numbers, operating status, and daily excursion assignments, (2) All locomotives assigned to the 'Sunset Picnic Trip' were identified: locomotive #1060 (steam, 0-4-0), locomotive #93 (diesel, NW2), and locomotive #57 (diesel, GP30), (3) The probability calculation shows 1 steam locomotive out of 3 total locomotives assigned to the Sunset Picnic Trip, (4) This results in a 1 in 3 chance that today's Sunset Picnic Trip will use a steam locomotive. Final answer: 1 in 3.",
