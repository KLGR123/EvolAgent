### Calculate hours for Kipchoge at record marathon pace to cover Earth-Moon perigee distance

**TASK**: If Eliud Kipchoge could maintain his record-making marathon pace indefinitely, how many thousand hours would it take him to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon its closest approach? Please use the minimum perigee value on the Wikipedia page for the Moon when carrying out your calculation. Round your result to the nearest 1000 hours and do not use any comma separators if necessary.

Based on the HISTORY feedback from the tester, the previous implementation executed successfully and completed all requirements:\n\n✓ **Official World Record Time Identified**: 2:01:09 from Berlin Marathon 2018\n✓ **Unofficial Breaking2 Time Excluded**: Correctly filtered out the 2:00:25 time trial with pacers\n✓ **Comprehensive Pace Calculations Completed**: \n  - Per kilometer: 2:52.3 min/km\n  - Per mile: 4:37.2 min/mile  \n  - Speed: 20.90 km/h\n  - Speed: 12.98 mph\n✓ **Source Verification**: Analyzed Wikipedia and Runner's World sources with confidence scoring\n✓ **Results Saved**: Complete analysis saved to 'workspace/kipchoge_final_world_record_pace_analysis.json'\n\nThe tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with mathematically accurate calculations and proper source verification. The implementation successfully found Eliud Kipchoge's marathon world record time (2:01:09 from Berlin Marathon 2018) and calculated his record-making pace in multiple formats as requested.

    "description": "Task completed successfully! The minimum perigee distance value has been successfully located and extracted from the Moon's Wikipedia page. The code accessed the Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon), parsed the HTML content, and systematically searched for orbital characteristics data. Key findings: (1) Successfully extracted perigee distance from the infobox table: 'Perigee: 362600 km (356400–370400 km)', (2) Found multiple perigee distance patterns throughout the page text, with the most accurate value being 356,400 km mentioned in the main content describing Earth-Moon distance variations, (3) Confirmed the minimum perigee distance as 356,400 km with units in kilometers, which represents the closest approach distance between Earth and Moon. The extraction data was saved to 'workspace/moon_perigee_extraction.json' for reference. The PLAN objective has been fully achieved - the minimum perigee distance value (356,400 km) is now available for calculating the Earth-Moon distance at closest approach.",

The task required calculating the time for Eliud Kipchoge to run the Earth-Moon minimum perigee distance using his marathon world record pace of 20.90 km/h and the minimum perigee distance of 356,400 km, then converting to thousand hours and rounding to the nearest 1000 hours. The calculation was performed correctly: 356,400 km ÷ 20.90 km/h = 17,052.63 hours, which rounds to 17,000 hours, or 17 thousand hours.
