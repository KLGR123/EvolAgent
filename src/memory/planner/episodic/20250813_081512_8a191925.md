    "plan": "Research Abel Hugo, Victor Hugo's brother, focusing on his military service during the Napoleonic Wars and his time in Madrid. Search for information about his authorship of works containing maps of Napoleon's camps in Spain, his connection to the Hospital de Saint Louis in Madrid (converted to military hospital in 1809), and identify during which ruler's reign these events occurred. Look for biographical details about Abel Hugo's military career, his publications, and the specific timeframe when he was in Madrid with Victor Hugo.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to establish Abel Hugo's identity, military background, and authorship credentials before identifying the specific ruler, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this topic, (3) Expected outcome is to gather comprehensive information about Abel Hugo's time in Madrid, his military service, and his published works with Napoleon's camp maps, (4) This foundational research will enable us to determine the specific ruler during whose reign these events took place",
