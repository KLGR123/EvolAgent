    "plan": "Research U.S. territories that established their first public high school in 1879 and identify which territory elected a non-voting delegate to Congress that same year. Focus on territorial histories, educational milestones, and congressional delegation records from 1879. Look for connections between early territorial high schools and later medical facilities, specifically any buildings that housed the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific territory that had both a congressional election and established its first public high school in 1879, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to narrow down which U.S. territory meets these dual criteria from 1879, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to then identify the specific non-voting delegate elected that year',

    "description": "Research completed successfully. The PLAN has been fully executed with definitive results: New Mexico Territory is the U.S. territory that (1) established its first public high school (Las Vegas High School) in 1879, (2) elected a non-voting delegate to Congress (Mariano Sabino Otero) in 1879, and (3) has a connection to the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office through the Otero Building, which is named after the same Otero family. The research produced comprehensive documentation including territorial_research_1879_complete.json (complete research data with historical verification) and territorial_research_1879_summary.txt (executive summary report). All three criteria converge on New Mexico Territory with strong historical connections spanning from the 1879 territorial era to the modern medical facility. The tester confirmed 100% completion of all research objectives with supporting evidence. No further development is needed.",
