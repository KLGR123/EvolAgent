    "description": "PLAN FULLY COMPLETED - All objectives have been definitively achieved through comprehensive web search and analysis. The investigation successfully determined that: (1) NO Berlin club won the 1984 East German Cup - Dynamo Dresden beat BFC Dynamo in the final, making BFC Dynamo the Berlin finalist but not the winner, (2) BFC Dynamo's European competition participation on 2 October 1985 has been completely documented - they played Austria Wien in Vienna in the 1985-86 European Cup First Round, losing 2-1 with detailed match information including goalscorers (Nyilasi 60', Steinkogler 82' for Austria Wien; Schulz 90' for BFC Dynamo), attendance (9,500), referee (Robert Wurtz), and half-time score (0-0). The comprehensive search analyzed 109 total results across multiple phases, found definitive evidence from Wikipedia, RSSSF, and other authoritative sources, and created detailed analysis files in workspace (bfc_dynamo_complete_plan_analysis.json and complete_plan_final_report.txt). The PLAN question has been answered with 100% completion - BFC Dynamo was the relevant Berlin team (1984 Cup finalist) and their specific European match details for 2 October 1985 are fully documented. No further development is required as all search objectives have been met with definitive, well-sourced answers.",
