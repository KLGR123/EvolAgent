### Estimating Number of False-Positive Nature 2020 Papers with Mean p-Value of 0.04

**TASK**: If we assume all articles published by Nature in 2020 (articles, only, not book reviews/columns, etc) relied on statistical significance to justify their findings and they on average came to a p-value of 0.04, how many papers would be incorrect as to their claims of statistical significance? Round the value up to the next integer.

    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the baseline number of Nature research articles from 2020 to calculate how many would be statistically incorrect, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the total count of research articles published by Nature in 2020, (4) This provides the foundation for applying the statistical significance error rate calculation based on the given p-value of 0.04',

    "description": "TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - The PLAN has been fully executed and the definitive answer has been found. Through systematic analysis of Nature journal's official 2020 research articles archive (https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?type=article&year=2020), I successfully determined that Nature journal published 1,002 research articles in 2020. \n\nKEY FINDINGS:\n• Final Answer: 1,002 research articles published by Nature journal in 2020\n• Source: Official Nature journal archive with type=article filter\n• Verification: Pattern 'Article (1002)' found 4 times in the archive content\n• Content Type: Peer-reviewed research articles only (excludes editorials, book reviews, columns, correspondence, and other non-research content as specified in the PLAN)\n• Confidence Level: High (direct extraction from authoritative source)\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n1. Accessed Nature journal's official 2020 research articles archive\n2. Downloaded and analyzed archive content from multiple Nature journal pages\n3. Performed pattern matching to identify article count indicators\n4. Verified filters confirmed research articles only (type=article parameter)\n5. Cross-referenced findings across multiple archive files\n6. Documented comprehensive evidence and verification details\n\nOUTPUT FILES CREATED:\n• FINAL_ANSWER_Nature_2020_Research_Articles.json - Complete documentation with source verification, methodology, and confidence assessment\n• Multiple archive analysis files with detailed content extraction\n• Comprehensive verification of filter indicators and content types\n\nThe PLAN requirement to 'focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing' has been satisfied through the type=article filter confirmation, which specifically excludes editorials, book reviews, columns, and other non-research content. The answer of 1,002 research articles is definitive and well-documented with high confidence from the official Nature journal source.",

    "plan": "Calculate the number of statistically incorrect papers using the false positive rate principle. Given that Nature published 1,002 research articles in 2020, all assumed to rely on statistical significance with an average p-value of 0.04, determine how many would be incorrectly claiming statistical significance. Apply the concept that a p-value of 0.04 means there's a 4% chance of a false positive (Type I error) when the null hypothesis is true. Calculate 1,002 × 0.04 and round up to the next integer as specified in the TASK.",

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. The statistical calculation has been performed correctly according to the PLAN requirements. The code calculated that out of 1,002 Nature research articles from 2020 with an average p-value of 0.04, exactly 41 papers would be statistically incorrect due to false positive (Type I error) rates. The calculation used the formula: 1,002 × 0.04 = 40.08, which was properly rounded up to 41 using math.ceil() as specified. The tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with no errors and verified that all objectives were achieved including: (1) mathematical calculation performed correctly, (2) statistical concept explanation provided, (3) proper rounding methodology applied, and (4) comprehensive results saved to workspace/statistical_calculation_results.json. The final answer of 41 papers is mathematically sound and represents the expected number of studies that would incorrectly claim statistical significance when the null hypothesis is actually true, based on the false positive rate principle.',
