### Determine hex color of 11th move landing cell on Excel grid avoiding blue cells

**TASK**: You are given this Excel file as a map. You start on the START cell and move toward the END cell. You are allowed to move two cells per turn, and you may move up, down, left, or right. You may not move fewer than two cells, and you may not move backward. You must avoid moving onto any blue cells. On the eleventh turn, what is the 6-digit hex code (without prefix) of the color of the cell where you land after moving?

    "description": "The adjacency list generation task is complete and has been verified by the tester.\n\n- The script read workspace/grid_data.json, discovered it’s a top-level list of 180 cell objects with keys row, col, value, fill_color.\n- It built a cell map by (row, col), then for each cell generated edges in the four cardinal directions only when the neighbor exists and its fill_color != '0099FF'.\n- It wrote the resulting adjacency list to workspace/adjacency_cardinal.json and reported 180 nodes with 248 directed edges, matching expected filtering logic.\n\nNo further changes are required. The PLAN’s goals have been achieved. <END>",
