    "plan": "Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to access the YouTube video to find the specific dialogue exchange mentioned in the TASK, (2) No previous analysis has been conducted on this video, (3) Expected outcome is to locate and transcribe Teal'c's response to the question 'Isn't that hot?', (4) This directly addresses the core TASK of identifying what Teal'c says in response to that specific question",

    "description": "The PLAN has been successfully completed. Through multiple iterative attempts, I successfully accessed and analyzed the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate Teal'c's exact response to the question 'Isn't that hot?'. The comprehensive analysis achieved the following: (1) Successfully downloaded the 29-second Teal'c coffee scene video (1.19 MB MP4 file), (2) Extracted and enhanced audio using pydub with normalization and dynamic range compression, (3) Applied optimized speech recognition settings to successfully transcribe the audio, (4) Identified Teal'c's exact response as 'extremely', (5) Confirmed this matches Teal'c's characteristic direct speaking pattern from Stargate SG-1, and (6) Provided logical interpretation that 'extremely' is his response to 'Isn't that hot?' meaning the coffee is extremely hot. The final answer is definitively documented: **Teal'c's exact response to 'Isn't that hot?' is 'extremely'**. This represents his characteristic direct manner of confirming that the coffee is extremely hot, which is consistent with the famous Stargate SG-1 scene where Teal'c tries coffee for the first time. All analysis results, transcription files, and definitive answer documentation have been saved to workspace files including tealc_definitive_answer.json and tealc_definitive_answer.txt. The objective has been 100% achieved with high confidence based on successful audio transcription and character-consistent dialogue analysis.",
