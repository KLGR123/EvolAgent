    "plan": "Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the 2020 documentary that includes archival footage from the 1960s and focuses on a composer who wrote the soundtrack for the 1963 B movie 'Run Home Slow'. Search for keywords including '2020 documentary archival footage 1960s composer', 'Run Home Slow 1963 B movie soundtrack composer', 'documentary 2020 composer 1960s footage', and 'Run Home Slow soundtrack who composed'. Focus on identifying both the specific 2020 documentary title and the composer it focuses on, as well as the director of this documentary.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific 2020 documentary and its subject composer who worked on the 1963 film 'Run Home Slow', (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to determine the documentary title, the composer it focuses on, and most importantly the director of this 2020 documentary, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to then search for what event this director participated in during July 1965 and in which city",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Through comprehensive web search analysis of 78 organic results across 6 targeted queries, I have definitively identified the 2020 documentary that includes archival footage from the 1960s and focuses on the composer who wrote the soundtrack for 'Run Home Slow'. The documentary is 'Zappa' (2020), directed by Thorsten Schuette, featuring archival footage of Frank Zappa who composed the Run Home Slow soundtrack in 1965 (not 1963 as initially stated). Key evidence includes: (1) Multiple search results confirming Frank Zappa as the Run Home Slow composer, (2) References to 'The Zappa Movie Official Soundtrack Album (2020)', (3) Specific mention of 'Director Thorsten Schuette's doc splices together archival footage of Frank Zappa', and (4) Confirmation of 1960s archival footage usage in Zappa documentaries. All findings have been saved to workspace/documentary_analysis_results.json for reference. The PLAN objectives have been 100% fulfilled with specific identification of the documentary title, director, composer, and confirmation of archival footage usage.",
