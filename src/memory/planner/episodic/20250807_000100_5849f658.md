### Page Count of Robot Space Series Debut by Underwater-Welder Author & Dark Peter Pan Illustrator

**TASK**: "What is the number of pages in the book that is the first volume of a series, features a robot protagonist, takes place in space, is written by an author who also wrote a graphic novel about an underwater welder set in the deep ocean exploring the theme of unresolved paternal trauma, and is illustrated by an illustrator whose work is a graphic novel series that is a dark reimagining of Peter Pan's 'never grow up' theme, featuring immortal children surviving in a post-apocalyptic world, exploring themes of moral conflict between retaining innocence and fulfilling predatory instincts, includes non-linear storytelling with origin stories from the 1763 Black Forest and 1945 Hiroshima, is illustrated with black and white art punctuated by red accents, has a narrative structure emphasizing existential monotony through sparse dialogue, and ends with an unresolved cliffhanger involving tragic loss during human confrontation?"

    "plan": 'Search for information about graphic novels featuring robot protagonists in space that are first volumes of series. Focus on identifying works that match the complex criteria: authored by someone who also wrote about an underwater welder with paternal trauma themes, and illustrated by an artist known for dark Peter Pan reimaginings with immortal children in post-apocalyptic settings, black/white/red art style, and non-linear storytelling spanning 1763-1945.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) The TASK requires identifying a very specific book through multiple interconnected criteria about author, illustrator, and thematic elements, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to narrow down potential matches by searching for graphic novels that combine space/robot themes with the distinctive artistic and narrative elements described, (4) This systematic approach will help identify the unique work that satisfies all the complex requirements before determining its page count',
