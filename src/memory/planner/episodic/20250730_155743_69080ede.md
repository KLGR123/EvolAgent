### Unlambda code: which character to add to output “For penguins”?

**TASK**: In Unlambda, what exact charcter or text needs to be added to correct the following code to output "For penguins"? If what is needed is a character, answer with the name of the character. If there are different names for the character, use the shortest. The text location is not needed. Code:

`r```````````.F.o.r. .p.e.n.g.u.i.n.si

    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand Unlambda's syntax to identify what's missing in the given code, (2) No prior research has been done on this language yet, (3) Expected outcome is to gain sufficient knowledge about Unlambda to analyze the provided code snippet, (4) Understanding the language fundamentals is critical before we can determine what character needs to be added to fix the code.",

    "description": 'The task has been successfully completed. I\'ve provided a comprehensive implementation that researches and analyzes the Unlambda programming language, with specific focus on understanding syntax for outputting text strings like "For penguins".\n\nThe code successfully created:\n1. A syntax reference document explaining Unlambda\'s core operators and principles\n2. A "Hello, World!" example with detailed explanation\n3. Two different implementations for outputting "For penguins" in Unlambda\n4. Additional examples showing different output patterns\n5. A comprehensive summary of findings\n\nThe key finding is that in Unlambda, to output a text string like "For penguins", we use the `.c` operator to print each character and chain these operations using the backtick (`) application operator. The complete solution is:\n``````````````.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i\n\nAs confirmed by the tester\'s feedback, the code executed successfully and fully met the requirements specified in the PLAN. All necessary files were generated in the workspace directory, and the implementation thoroughly demonstrates how to create Unlambda code that outputs the desired text string.',

    "description": "Task completed successfully. After analyzing the Unlambda code, I've identified that the exact character needed to fix the code is the backtick (`). The given code lacks backticks between the dot operators. In Unlambda, `.c` prints character c, but these operations need to be connected with backticks (`) as application operators. The correct format should be: `````````````.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i. Final answer: backtick",
