### **Title:**  
Identify a society-type label shared between a 2022 AI regulation paper and a 2016 Physics and Society article on arXiv.

**TASK**: A paper about AI regulation that was originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022 shows a figure with three axes, where each axis has a label word at both ends. Which of these words is used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016?

    "plan": 'Search arXiv.org for AI regulation papers originally submitted in June 2022. Focus on identifying papers that discuss artificial intelligence regulation, policy, governance, or related topics. Look for papers with submission dates in June 2022 and examine their content to find one containing a figure with three axes where each axis has label words at both ends. Extract the specific words used as axis labels in this figure.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific AI regulation paper from June 2022 that contains the three-axis figure before we can find the axis label words, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the relevant paper and extract the figure with its axis labels, (4) This establishes the foundation for the second part of the task - finding which of these words appears in a Physics and Society article from August 11, 2016',
