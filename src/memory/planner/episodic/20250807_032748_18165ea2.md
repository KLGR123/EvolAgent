    "plan": 'Search for information about V-bomber aircraft that were converted into tanker aircraft. Focus on identifying which specific V-bomber was the only one converted for aerial refueling purposes, then locate books written about this aircraft conversion. Look for publication details including the publisher and country of publication for any books covering this unique aircraft conversion story.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) The TASK requires identifying a book about a specific V-bomber aircraft conversion and determining its publication country, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to identify which V-bomber was uniquely converted to tanker role and find associated literature, (4) This systematic approach will help narrow down the specific aircraft and related publications before determining the country of publication',

The code successfully identified the Handley Page Victor as the only V-bomber extensively converted for aerial refueling purposes, discovered multiple books covering this aircraft conversion story, and provided comprehensive publication details including publishers and countries. Key achievements: (1) Aircraft identification: Handley Page Victor confirmed as the sole V-bomber converted to tanker role with K.1 and K.2 variants, (2) Book discovery: Found 5 unique titles covering the conversion story, (3) Publisher analysis: Identified UK publishers (Pen & Sword Aviation, Grub Street, Ian Allan Publishing, Midland Publishing) and US publisher (Aerofax), (4) Country analysis: Confirmed United Kingdom as primary publication country, (5) File outputs: Created comprehensive JSON files in workspace containing all research findings. The tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with all objectives met including aircraft identification, book discovery, and publisher/country details. No further development needed as the research comprehensively answers the question about which V-bomber was converted to tanker aircraft and provides detailed information about books documenting this unique conversion story.',
