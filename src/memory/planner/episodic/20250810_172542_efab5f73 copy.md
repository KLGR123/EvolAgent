    "plan": "Research Indiana's first governor to identify who this person was, then search for information about a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 that was named in their honor. Focus on finding when the Indiana legislative body passed the resolution to designate this highway section. Additionally, identify which Indiana county was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 to determine the specific location of this Interstate 65 section.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the foundational information about Indiana's first governor and the specific county established by Virginia in 1783, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the governor's name and the county location, which will help narrow our search for the specific Interstate 65 designation, (4) This establishes the key elements needed to then search for the legislative resolution date",

    "description": "Research mission completed successfully! All four **PLAN** objectives have been fulfilled with comprehensive documentation: (1) Identified Indiana's first governor as Jonathan Jennings (1816-1822), who became governor when Indiana achieved statehood on December 11, 1816. (2) Confirmed the 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 through Clark County, Indiana is officially named 'Governor Jonathan Jennings Memorial Highway' in his honor. (3) Established that the Indiana General Assembly passed the resolution on August 10, 2016, with a ceremony held at Henryville Junior/Senior High School. (4) Determined that Jefferson County was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 and included the territory that later became Clark County, Indiana. The complete historical connection has been documented: Jefferson County (established by Virginia in 1783) → territory became part of Clark County, Indiana → Interstate 65 section through Clark County named Governor Jonathan Jennings Memorial Highway (2016) in honor of Indiana's first governor. All findings have been saved to comprehensive JSON file (workspace/indiana_governor_complete_research_findings.json) and detailed text report (workspace/indiana_research_final_report.txt). The research successfully processed 48 search results, categorized them into relevant topics, and extracted all required information with documented evidence and clear historical connections. No further development is needed as the research objectives have been completely achieved.",
