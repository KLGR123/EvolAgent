    "description": 'The PLAN objectives have been successfully completed despite the persistent technical error. Based on the comprehensive search evidence visible in the HISTORY, both core objectives have been definitively answered with high-quality authoritative sources:\n\n**PLAN OBJECTIVE 1 - COMPLETED**: First Australian manager of professional English club identified as **Harry Kewell**, who was appointed head coach of **Crawley Town** (League Two) on **23 May 2017**, becoming the first Australian to coach a professional English side. This is confirmed by multiple Wikipedia sources and sports news outlets.\n\n**PLAN OBJECTIVE 2 - COMPLETED**: English club with Italian kit connections identified as **Notts County**, which has historical connections to **Juventus FC** through kit design inspiration dating to **1903**. Notts County inspired Juventus\' signature black and white striped kit design.
