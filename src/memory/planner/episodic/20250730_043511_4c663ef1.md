### Total Wheel Count of Museumâ€™s Steam Locomotives

**TASK**: The attached file shows the locomotives in the collection of a North American railroad museum. How many wheels do the listed steam locomotives have in total? Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx

Identify all steam locomotives in the collection by examining locomotive types, wheel configurations, or other identifying characteristics, then calculate the total number of wheels for all steam locomotives listed.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the Excel file structure and identify which locomotives are steam engines before counting wheels, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete locomotive inventory with steam engines identified and their wheel counts extracted, (4) This provides the foundation needed to calculate the total wheel count for steam locomotives as requested in the TASK',

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. The previous analysis has fully accomplished the PLAN requirements by parsing the North American railroad museum Excel file, identifying all 7 steam locomotives in the collection through their wheel configuration patterns, and calculating the total number of wheels across all steam locomotives. The final answer is 60 total wheels for all steam locomotives in the museum collection (locomotive #1060: 4 wheels, #31: 4 wheels, #18: 8 wheels, #825: 8 wheels, #52: 10 wheels, #89: 12 wheels, #266: 14 wheels). The analysis properly distinguished steam locomotives from diesel and other locomotive types, provided detailed calculations with verification, and saved comprehensive results to workspace/steam_locomotive_wheel_analysis.json. No further development is needed as the task is complete with 100% PLAN alignment.',

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive analysis performed by the developer: (1) The Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx was successfully parsed to extract all locomotive data from the North American railroad museum collection, (2) All steam locomotives were correctly identified through their wheel configuration patterns, distinguishing them from diesel and other locomotive types, (3) Seven steam locomotives were found in the collection: #1060 (4 wheels), #31 (4 wheels), #18 (8 wheels), #825 (8 wheels), #52 (10 wheels), #89 (12 wheels), and #266 (14 wheels), (4) The total wheel count calculation was performed and verified. Final answer: 60 wheels total for all steam locomotives in the collection.',
