    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the first data point - the number of encoder blocks in BERT base model, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the official specification of BERT base encoder layers from authoritative sources like the original BERT paper or model documentation, (4) This provides the foundation for comparing against the Transformer architecture from 'Attention is All You Need' to calculate the difference",

    "description": 'Research task successfully completed. The systematic analysis of search results has definitively answered the research question: BERT-base model contains 12 encoder layers. Key accomplishments: (1) Successfully executed Google search using SerpAPI to find authoritative sources about BERT architecture, (2) Analyzed 10 search results and found evidence from 9 sources confirming BERT-base has 12 encoder layers, (3) Identified evidence from multiple source types including academic papers (arXiv original paper), educational tutorials, and technical documentation, (4) Generated comprehensive research documentation saved to workspace/bert_research_complete.json and workspace/bert_task_completion.json, (5) Achieved high confidence conclusion based on consistent evidence across multiple authoritative sources. The research findings align with the original BERT paper specifications where BERT-base is defined with 12 transformer encoder layers while BERT-large has 24 layers. Files created: workspace/bert_search_results.json (raw search data), workspace/bert_research_complete.json (detailed analysis), workspace/bert_task_completion.json (final report). The **PLAN** objective to research BERT base model architecture and determine the number of encoder blocks has been fully achieved with definitive results.',

    "description": "Research completed successfully! Based on the comprehensive analysis of the original 'Attention is All You Need' paper (arXiv:1706.03762) by Vaswani et al., I have definitively determined the number of encoder layers in the Transformer architecture.\n\n**DEFINITIVE ANSWER: The original Transformer architecture contains 6 encoder blocks/layers.**\n\nEvidence found from the paper analysis:\n1. Pattern 'encoder.*?N\\s*=\\s*(\\d+)' found matches: ['6']\n2. Pattern 'encoder.*?stack.*?(\\d+).*?layers?' found matches: ['6'] \n3. Pattern 'N\\s*=\\s*(\\d+).*?identical\\s+layers' found matches: ['6', '6']\n4. Pattern '(\\d+)\\s+identical\\s+layers' found matches: ['6']\n5. Context matches included: 'Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6'\n\nThe research process was completed through these steps:\n1. ✅ Successfully searched for and located the original paper on arXiv\n2. ✅ Downloaded the official PDF (2.2MB, 16 pages) from http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762\n3. ✅ Extracted and analyzed the PDF content using LangChain PyPDFLoader\n4. ✅ Found multiple consistent confirmations that N = 6 for the encoder layers\n5. ✅ Verified the finding through various regex patterns and contextual analysis\n\nFiles created in workspace/:\n- attention_paper_search_results.json (search results from SerpAPI)\n- attention_is_all_you_need.pdf (original paper PDF, 2.2MB)\n- attention_paper_content.txt (extracted PDF content for analysis)\n\nThe PLAN objective has been fully achieved - the original Transformer architecture from the seminal 'Attention is All You Need' paper uses exactly 6 encoder blocks/layers, as consistently found across multiple pattern matches in the paper's architecture description.",
