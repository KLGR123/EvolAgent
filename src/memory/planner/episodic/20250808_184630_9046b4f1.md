### Title:  
Compile and Run C++ Code from Python Output to Sum Sorted Array Elements

**TASK**: The attached image contains a Python script. Run the Python code against an array of strings, listed below. The output of the Python script will be a URL containing C++ source code. Compile and run this C++ code against the array [35, 12, 8, 99, 21, 5] and return the sum of the third and fifth integers in the sorted list.

arr = ['_alg', 'ghi', 'C++', 'jkl', 'tps', '/Q', 'pqr', 'stu', ':', '//', 'rose', 'vwx', 'yz1', '234', 'tta', '567', '890', 'cod', 'e.', 'or', 'g/', 'wiki', '/', 'ing', 'sort', 'abc' , 'or', 'it', 'hms', 'mno' , 'uic', 'ksort', '#', 'ht' ] Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png

    "description": "The **PLAN** has been fully completed by the previous developer. The task was to execute the Python script logic against the provided string array to generate a URL containing C++ source code, which has been successfully accomplished. The execution results show: (1) All 34 array elements were properly mapped and accessible, (2) The index array [33, 4, 8, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 23, 0, 26, 27, 28, 5, 30, 31, 32, 2] was used to select elements in the correct order, (3) The selected elements were joined to form 'https://rosettacode.org/wiki/sorting_algorithms/Quicksort#C++', (4) This was concatenated with the archive prefix to produce the final URL: 'https://web.archive.org/web/20230609112831/https://rosettacode.org/wiki/sorting_algorithms/Quicksort#C++'. The script successfully adapted to the provided array structure without bounds issues and generated the resulting URL pointing to C++ Quicksort source code on Rosetta Code. No further development is needed as the **PLAN** objective has been fully achieved with 100% completion as confirmed by the tester.",

    "description": "**PLAN COMPLETION SUMMARY**: The task has been successfully completed by the previous developer. The objective was to download the C++ source code from the specified URL and save it to workspace/quicksort.cpp for compilation and execution, which has been fully accomplished.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF COMPLETED WORK**:\n1. **Successful URL Access**: The previous developer successfully fetched the webpage from the web archive URL (https://web.archive.org/web/20230609112831/https://rosettacode.org/wiki/sorting_algorithms/Quicksort#C++) with HTTP status 200 and processed 1,382,475 characters of content.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Code Extraction**: The implementation systematically analyzed 393 potential C++ code blocks from the Rosetta Code page, using multiple search patterns and scoring candidates based on C++ indicators like '#include', 'std::', 'template<', 'quicksort', 'partition', etc.\n\n3. **Optimal Code Selection**: The highest-scoring candidate (Score: 6/6) was selected - a professional C++ quicksort implementation featuring:\n   - Standard library includes (`<iterator>`, `<algorithm>`, `<functional>`)\n   - Template-based generic implementation\n   - Median-of-three pivot selection for optimal performance\n   - STL algorithms integration (`std::partition`)\n   - Comprehensive helper functions and operators\n   - 1,912 characters of well-structured code\n\n4. **File Management**: The C++ source code was successfully saved to `workspace/quicksort.cpp` (1,912 bytes) and verification confirmed the content integrity.\n\n**DELIVERABLE STATUS**: The quicksort.cpp file is ready for compilation and execution as required by the **PLAN**. The implementation includes modern C++ best practices with templates, STL integration, and efficient algorithms suitable for production use.\n\n**NO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT NEEDED**: The **PLAN** objective has been achieved with 100% completion as confirmed by the tester's feedback.",

This has been fully accomplished with the following results:\n\n**EXECUTION SUMMARY**:\n1. **C++ Code Compilation**: The quicksort.cpp file was successfully compiled using g++ with C++11 standard, creating a working executable despite some deprecation warnings (which are expected for older C++ code but don't affect functionality).\n\n2. **Array Sorting**: The program correctly sorted the input array [35, 12, 8, 99, 21, 5] to produce [5, 8, 12, 21, 35, 99].\n\n3. **Element Identification**: The 3rd element in the sorted array is 12 (at 0-indexed position 2) and the 5th element is 35 (at 0-indexed position 4).\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: The sum of the 3rd and 5th elements is 12 + 35 = 47.\n\n**VERIFICATION**: The program execution was successful with return code 47, confirming the calculated result. The complete output showed the original array, sorted array, individual elements, and final sum calculation.\n\n**DELIVERABLES**: Results were properly documented in workspace/quicksort_result.txt for reference.\n\n**FINAL ANSWER**: 47 - This is the sum of the third and fifth integers in the sorted result of the array [35, 12, 8, 99, 21, 5].
