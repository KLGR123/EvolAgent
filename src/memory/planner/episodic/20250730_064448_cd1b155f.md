Identify the data structure including column headers and city organization, then calculate the total sales for Wharvton and Algrimand specifically to determine which city had greater total sales.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the Excel file structure and identify all sales data organized by city before comparing Wharvton and Algrimand totals, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete sales data with clear city identification and calculated totals for both target cities, (4) This provides the foundation needed to directly answer which city had greater total sales as requested in the TASK',
