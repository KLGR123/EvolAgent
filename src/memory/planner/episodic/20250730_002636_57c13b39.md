### First name of the firm that designed the Chicago landmark named for APOD horizon city namesake

**TASK**: During the first week of August 2015, one of the NASA Astronomy Pictures of the Day shows the lights of a city on the horizon. The namesake of this city also has a landmark building in Chicago named after him. What is the name of the architectural firm that designed this landmark building? Give the first name appearing in the name of the firm as of June 2023.

Look for entries that show city lights on the horizon and identify which city is featured. Use search approaches including: (1) Direct access to NASA APOD archives for August 2015, (2) Search 'NASA APOD August 2015 city lights horizon', (3) Browse the official NASA APOD website archive section for that specific date range. Extract the complete APOD entries including titles, descriptions, and image details to identify which city's lights are shown.",

    "description": "Final verification and confirmation of the completed research on Holabird & Roche architectural firm. This code loads and displays the comprehensive final answer file that was created in the previous step, verifying all research findings and confirming the answer to the PLAN question. The analysis confirms that: (1) The firm is currently known as 'Holabird & Root' as of June 2023, having evolved from 'Holabird & Roche', (2) 'Holabird' appears first in the firm name and refers to founder William Holabird (1854-1923), (3) Therefore 'William' is the first name appearing in the firm designation. The verification includes checking all evidence sources (official website, 2023 references, government sources), historical context (firm evolution timeline), and a complete verification checklist. The research successfully answers the PLAN requirement with strong documentation from multiple authoritative sources including the firm's official website (holabird.com), 2023 social media references, and government records confirming William Holabird as the founder.
