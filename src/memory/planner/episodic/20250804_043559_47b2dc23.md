### Difference Between Survivor S44 and American Idol Unique Winners

**TASK**: I'd like to learn more about some popular reality television competition shows. As of the end of the 44th season of the American version of Survivor, how many more unique winners have there been compared to the number of winners of American Idol?

    "description": "Rationale and Next Steps:\n\n1. Issue Discovery: The provided JSON file 'workspace/american_idol_winners_list.json' only contained date strings (e.g., 'September 4, 2002...') under the key 'winner_name', not actual contestant names. Thus, counting unique dates does not fulfill the PLAN of counting unique winners.\n\n2. Pivot Approach: To obtain real winner names, we automate a scrape of the Wikipedia page 'List_of_American_Idol_winners', which maintains a structured 'wikitable sortable' listing each season alongside its winner’s name.\n\n3. Implementation Steps:\n   - Fetch the Wikipedia page using `requests`.\n   - Parse the HTML with `BeautifulSoup`.\n   - Locate the correct table by matching its header cells for 'Season' and 'Winner'.\n   - Extract the second column of each data row (the winner’s name).\n   - Deduplicate and sort the list of names.\n   - Print the total and the full list for verification.\n   - Save the results to 'workspace/american_idol_unique_winner_count.json'.\n\n4. Advancement of PLAN: This fully addresses the objective by producing the actual unique count of American Idol winners (by name) rather than dates, meeting the PLAN requirement.\n\n5. Workspace Outputs:\n   - workspace/american_idol_unique_winner_count.json: { 'unique_winner_count': <int>, 'winners': [<sorted list of names>] }\n\nWith this approach, we have bypassed the faulty JSON source and directly retrieved the needed data to count and report the distinct American Idol winners. All steps include verbose printouts for tester validation. ",
