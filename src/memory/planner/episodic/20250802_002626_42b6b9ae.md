### Fact-Checking Greetham Citation: Verifying Quoted Passage from ‘Uncoupled’ Article

**TASK**: I need to fact-check a citation. This is the citation from the bibliography:

Greetham, David. "Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)." Textual Cultures: Texts, Contexts, Interpretation, vol. 3 no. 1, 2008, p. 45-46. Project MUSE, doi:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44.

And this is the in-line citation:

Our relationship with the authors of the works we read can often be “obscured not by a "cloak of print" but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission” (Greetham 45-46).

Does the quoted text match what is actually in the article? If Yes, answer Yes, otherwise, give me the word in my citation that does not match with the correct one (without any article).

The HISTORY shows that: (1) DOI 10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44 was successfully resolved to Project MUSE, (2) The correct article by David Greetham in Textual Cultures: Texts, Contexts, Interpretation (vol. 3, no. 1, 2008, pages 45-46) was identified and accessed, (3) The target quote \'obscured not by a "cloak of print" but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission\' was located with full context spanning pages 45-46, (4) An important discrepancy was detected - the actual article text shows \'veil of print\' instead of \'cloak of print\' as cited in the bibliography, indicating a potential transcription error, (5) Complete verification results were saved to workspace/quote_verification_pages_45_46.txt (3,357 bytes) and workspace/greetham_verification_analysis.json (641 bytes). The PLAN objective to \'extract the complete text from pages 45-46 to verify if the quoted passage appears exactly as cited in the bibliography\' has been fulfilled with 100% success. The quote was found, verified, and documented, with the additional valuable finding that the bibliography contains a transcription error (\'cloak\' vs \'veil\' of print). No further development work is required as all verification requirements have been met.',

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive verification conducted in the HISTORY, the developer has identified a discrepancy in the quoted text. The citation contains 'cloak of print' but the actual article text shows 'veil of print'. Since the quoted text does not match exactly what is in the article, the answer is not 'Yes'. The word that does not match is 'cloak' (which should be 'veil'). Final answer: cloak",
