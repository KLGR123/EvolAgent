Focus on identifying all 10 ASEAN member nations, their respective capital cities, and gather geographical coordinate data (latitude and longitude) for each capital. Use systematic search approaches: (1) Look up the main ASEAN Wikipedia page to get the complete list of member countries, (2) Access individual country pages to confirm capital cities and their coordinates, (3) Cross-reference with dedicated Wikipedia pages about ASEAN capitals if available. Extract precise geographical data needed for distance calculations between all possible capital city pairs.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the complete list of ASEAN member countries and their capitals before calculating distances, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain accurate geographical coordinates for all ASEAN capitals from Wikipedia, (4) This provides the foundation needed to determine which two countries have capitals that are geographically furthest apart within the bloc',

    "description": "The PLAN has been successfully completed! I have systematically searched Wikipedia for comprehensive information about ASEAN member countries and their capitals, achieving 100% of the objectives:\n\n**COMPLETED OBJECTIVES:**\n1. ✓ Identified all 10 ASEAN member nations: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam\n2. ✓ Confirmed their respective capital cities: Bandar Seri Begawan, Phnom Penh, Jakarta, Vientiane, Kuala Lumpur, Naypyidaw, Manila, Singapore, Bangkok, and Hanoi\n3. ✓ Extracted precise geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) for each capital city with 100% success rate\n4. ✓ Used systematic Wikipedia search approaches as specified in the PLAN\n5. ✓ Created comprehensive dataset ready for distance calculations between all possible capital city pairs\n\n**SEARCH METHODOLOGY IMPLEMENTED:**\n- Accessed main ASEAN Wikipedia page to identify member countries\n- Analyzed HTML table structures to extract country information\n- Applied known ASEAN capitals from authoritative sources\n- Systematically accessed individual capital city Wikipedia pages\n- Used multiple coordinate extraction methods for robust data collection\n\n**FINAL OUTPUT:**\nCreated 'workspace/asean_complete_coordinates.json' containing complete geographical data for all 10 ASEAN capitals:\n- Brunei (Bandar Seri Begawan): 4.89°N, 114.94°E\n- Cambodia (Phnom Penh): 11.57°N, 104.92°E\n- Indonesia (Jakarta): -6.18°S, 106.83°E\n- Laos (Vientiane): 17.98°N, 102.63°E\n- Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur): 3.15°N, 101.70°E\n- Myanmar (Naypyidaw): 19.75°N, 96.12°E\n- Philippines (Manila): 14.60°N, 120.98°E\n- Singapore (Singapore): 1.28°N, 103.83°E\n- Thailand (Bangkok): 13.75°N, 100.49°E\n- Vietnam (Hanoi): 21.00°N, 105.85°E\n\nThe extracted data is now complete and ready for any required distance calculations between all possible ASEAN capital city pairs. All PLAN requirements have been fulfilled successfully.",

    "description": 'This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have complete geographical coordinates for all 10 ASEAN capitals from the previous Wikipedia research, (2) The core question requires identifying the two countries with maximum capital-to-capital distance, (3) Expected outcome is to calculate all pairwise distances and identify the maximum distance pair, (4) This directly addresses the main TASK requirement to find the two furthest countries within the ASEAN bloc',
