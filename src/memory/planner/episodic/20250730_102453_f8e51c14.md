### Calculate ISBN-10 check digit for Tropicos ID of Order Helotiales

**TASK**: Compute the check digit the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales would have if it were an ISBN-10 number.

    "plan": "Search for the Tropicos ID of the taxonomic Order Helotiales. Conduct a comprehensive web search using multiple approaches: (1) Search the Missouri Botanical Garden's Tropicos database directly at tropicos.org for 'Helotiales', (2) Use Google search with terms 'Helotiales Tropicos ID taxonomic order', (3) Search botanical databases and taxonomic resources that may reference Tropicos IDs, (4) Look for scientific literature or taxonomic databases that cross-reference Helotiales with its Tropicos identifier. Extract the complete Tropicos ID number for the Order Helotiales, ensuring it's the correct taxonomic rank (Order level, not family or genus level entries).",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific Tropicos ID for Order Helotiales before we can calculate its ISBN-10 check digit, (2) No previous search has been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the numerical Tropicos ID that will be used for the ISBN-10 check digit calculation, (4) This directly addresses the foundation requirement for the TASK - we must have the Tropicos ID to proceed with the mathematical conversion',

    "description": 'The search for the Tropicos ID of Order Helotiales has been successfully completed. Through the comprehensive multi-method approach implemented in the previous iteration, the correct Tropicos ID has been definitively identified as **100370510**.\n\n**Key findings from the search results:**\n\n1. **Primary confirmation from Wikidata**: The Wikidata entry for Helotiales (Q134490) explicitly states "Tropicos ID · 100370510" with a reference to Tropicos database retrieved on September 10, 2020.\n\n2. **Secondary confirmation from Wikimedia Commons**: The Category:Helotiales page on commons.wikimedia.org also displays "Tropicos ID: 100370510" along with other taxonomic database identifiers.\n\n3. **Taxonomic rank verification**: A Tropicos family page (Dermateaceae) shows the complete taxonomic hierarchy including "order: Helotiales" confirming this is indeed the Order-level taxonomic rank, not family or genus level.\n\n**Search methodology validation:**\nThe implemented approach successfully used:\n- Direct Tropicos database queries\n- Google search with multiple targeted query strings including \'Helotiales Tropicos ID taxonomic order\'\n- Cross-referencing through multiple authoritative sources (Wikidata, Wikimedia Commons, Tropicos family pages)\n\n**Final result:** The complete Tropicos ID number for taxonomic Order Helotiales is **100370510**.\n\n**Files generated in workspace:**\n- `tropicos_direct_search.html`: Direct Tropicos search results\n- `helotiales_google_search_results.json`: Comprehensive Google search results with all query variations\n\nThe PLAN has been 100% completed - the Tropicos ID for Order Helotiales (100370510) has been successfully identified and verified through multiple independent authoritative sources, ensuring it corresponds to the correct taxonomic rank at the Order level.',

Apply the standard ISBN-10 check digit algorithm: multiply each digit by its position weight (1st digit × 10, 2nd digit × 9, 3rd digit × 8, etc.), sum all products, find the remainder when divided by 11, and determine the check digit (0-9 or X for remainder 10).

    "description": "Task completed successfully. The ISBN-10 check digit calculation for Tropicos ID 100370510 has been fully implemented and verified. The solution correctly applied the standard ISBN-10 algorithm, calculating the check digit as '8' and producing the complete ISBN-10 as '1003705108'. The calculation process included: (1) Converting the ID to individual digits [1,0,0,3,7,0,5,1,0], (2) Applying position weights [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2], (3) Computing products and summing to 96, (4) Finding remainder 96 mod 11 = 8, (5) Determining check digit as '8'. The implementation provided detailed step-by-step output, included verification logic that confirmed correctness, and saved comprehensive results to both 'workspace/isbn10_calculation.json' and 'workspace/isbn10_result.txt' files as requested in the PLAN. The tester confirmed 100% plan completion with no errors and all requirements fulfilled.",
