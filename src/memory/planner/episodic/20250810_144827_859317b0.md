    "description": "Based on the comprehensive analysis completed in HISTORY, the PLAN has been successfully fulfilled. The investigation into Greg Chappell's death status has been thoroughly completed with definitive results:\n\n**FINAL ANSWER TO PLAN**: Greg Chappell (the Australian cricket legend) has NOT passed away. He is still alive as of January 2025.\n\n**COMPREHENSIVE EVIDENCE SUMMARY**:\n- Conducted extensive web searches using targeted queries including 'Greg Chappell death date', 'Greg Chappell died year', 'Greg Chappell obituary', and 'Greg Chappell Australian cricketer death'\n- Analyzed 139 total Greg Chappell mentions across search results\n- Found 39 death evidence instances with a death evidence score of 172\n- Discovered obituaries for people named Greg Chappell, but these relate to different individuals:\n  * Greg Chappell from Snellville, Georgia (died November 25, 2024)\n  * Gregory Jo-lan Chappell from Maryland (died December 28, 2024)\n- No credible death information found specifically for the Australian cricket legend\n- Systematic absence of obituaries in cricket-specific sources\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**:\n1. Greg Chappell (born August 7, 1948) is the Australian cricket captain who led Australia between 1975-1977\n2. He is a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) and former coach of the Indian cricket team\n3. Death information for cricket legends is typically widely reported by cricket media\n4.

    "plan": "Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.",
    "description": "This re-examination is necessary because: (1) The TASK specifically states 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but our HISTORY identified Greg Chappell as scoring 300+ runs, creating a contradiction, (2) We may have misinterpreted the TASK - it could be asking for the captain of a match where Arthur Morris (not the captain himself) scored 300+ runs, (3) Expected outcome is to find the correct Test match where Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs and identify who captained Australia in that match, (4) This ensures we're answering the right question about the correct Australian cricketer's death year",

    "description": "The PLAN objective has already been completely fulfilled through comprehensive analysis shown in the HISTORY. The research definitively established that: (1) Arthur Morris never scored over 300 runs in any Test innings - his highest was 206 runs, (2) Statistical evidence shows '300s: 0' (zero triple centuries) for Morris in his career, (3) The original TASK premise was factually incorrect, (4) Don Bradman was the actual Australian who scored 300+ runs (334 runs vs England at Leeds in 1930), and (5) Bill Woodfull was the Australian captain in that match. The HISTORY shows 48 search results were analyzed with definitive evidence including explicit statistical records confirming Morris never scored 300+ runs. Multiple authoritative sources (ESPNCricinfo, HowStat, Wikipedia, Australian Sports Hall of Fame) all confirm 206 as Morris's highest Test score. The corrected and complete answer to the original TASK is: When Don Bradman (the Australian who actually scored over 300 runs with 334) played against England at Leeds in 1930, the Australian captain was Bill Woodfull. All verification files have been saved to workspace and the analysis is complete with 100% certainty.",

    "plan": "Search for information about when Bill Woodfull, the Australian cricket captain who led Australia when Don Bradman scored 334 runs against England at Leeds in 1930, passed away. Focus on finding his death date and year using search terms including 'Bill Woodfull death date', 'Bill Woodfull died year', 'Bill Woodfull Australian cricket captain obituary', and 'William Woodfull death'. Verify the information from reliable cricket databases, historical records, or official sources.",
    "description": "This is the necessary next step because: (1) The HISTORY has corrected the original TASK premise and identified that Bill Woodfull was the Australian captain when the first 300+ run Test innings occurred (Don Bradman's 334 at Leeds in 1930), not a match involving Arthur Morris who never scored over 300 runs, (2) We now need to determine when Bill Woodfull passed away to complete the TASK, (3) Expected outcome is to find Bill Woodfull's death year from authoritative cricket or historical sources, (4) This directly addresses the core question asking for the year of death of the Australian captain from the historically significant Test match",
