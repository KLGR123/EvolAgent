### Development Step 7: Identify 19th-Century Vegetarian Bedcradle User and Comte Translator Who Wrote “Morals & Manners”

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify a person who used a bedcradle, practiced vegetarianism, authored 'How to Observe Morals and Manners' (focusing on applying scientific methods to social behavior), translated Auguste Comte's 'Cours de Philosophie Positive', and created an abridged version called 'The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte' which received criticism from Comte himself. Search using keywords including 'How to Observe Morals and Manners author', 'Positive Philosophy Auguste Comte translator', 'bedcradle vegetarian author 19th century', 'Cours de Philosophie Positive English translation', and 'Auguste Comte critic translator'. Focus on identifying this specific author who combined sociological methodology, positivist philosophy translation work, and distinctive personal habits.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historians conducting a systematic review of 19th-century philosophical translators: automate web searches across university archives, parse HTML pages for key terms (e.g., “Comte translation,” “positivist”), and produce a ranked list of candidate translators with evidence summaries and source snippets.
- Legal due-diligence teams verifying executive leadership backgrounds: scrape company websites, regulatory filings, and news articles to extract terms like “board member,” “litigation,” and “controversy,” assign relevance scores, and compile confidence-rated profiles.
- Market research analysts profiling emerging tech founders: crawl startup blogs, LinkedIn pages, and investor decks for mentions of “product launch,” “funding round,” “patent,” compute weighted term frequencies, and generate top-relevance snapshots for investment committees.
- Investigative journalists fact-checking public figures: perform keyword-driven web searches on speeches, opinion pieces, and social media, strip out scripts/styles, detect evidence (e.g., “conflict of interest,” “public apology”), and extract verifiable text snippets for story sourcing.
- Genealogy hobbyists tracing ancestral occupations and personal health practices: automate searches of newspaper archives for terms like “vegetarian,” “bedcradle,” “obituary,” and summarize findings by date, relevance score, and text excerpts to build family profiles.
- Healthcare policy researchers mapping mentions of medical devices in literature: scrape medical journals, regulatory notices, and patient blogs for “bedcradle,” “wheelchair,” “prosthetic,” score relevance, and produce a consolidated evidence report for policy briefs.
- Publisher’s rights managers monitoring unauthorized translations: scan international bookstore websites and repositories for “abridged,” “translation by,” “Comte,” flag high-relevance hits, and compile a list of potential IP infringements with source evidence.
