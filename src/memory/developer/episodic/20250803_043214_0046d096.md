### Development Step 2: Identify First Year AAPL Stock Price Exceeded $50 Unadjusted on Google Finance

**Description**: Search Google Finance for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price historical data to identify the first year when Apple's stock price exceeded $50 per share without adjusting for stock splits. Access Google Finance directly or use web search to find Apple's historical stock price charts and data, focusing on identifying the earliest date when the stock crossed the $50 threshold in its original, non-split-adjusted form.

**Use Cases**:
- Financial analytics for long-term portfolio managers: automatically scraping and validating when AAPL first crossed $50 non-split-adjusted to annotate milestone returns in client reports
- Historical performance research by market analysts: aggregating pre-split stock price data to compare tech stock growth trajectories during the 1980s personal-computer boom
- Automated milestone detection in investment dashboards: integrating a web-scraping pipeline to flag the exact year Apple shares exceeded $50 for real-time alerting in wealth-management platforms
- Academic case studies in finance courses: providing students with a reproducible method to extract non-split-adjusted prices and understand the impact of stock splits on historical valuation
- Financial journalism and anniversary features: enabling reporters to fetch and confirm the first $50+ trading date of AAPL for commemorative articles and data-driven storytelling
- Quantitative research in economic history: using alternative HTML parsing when APIs fail to build datasets on pre-split stock prices for regression models of market cycles
- Regulatory compliance audit trails: supplying documented evidence of key stock price thresholds for disclosure filings that require proof of when a security first achieved specific price levels
