### Development Step 28: Anivaldo Miranda and Maciel Oliveira: Religious Backgrounds in CBHSF Sobradinho Dam Advocacy

**Description**: Search for detailed biographical information about the specific individuals identified within CBHSF who advocated for Sobradinho Dam displaced people, particularly focusing on Anivaldo Miranda and Maciel Oliveira. Look for their religious affiliations, personal backgrounds, and any mentions of their faith or religious involvement in their advocacy work. Search for keywords including their names combined with terms like 'religião', 'católico', 'protestante', 'evangélico', 'fé', 'igreja', and other religious identifiers in Portuguese sources.

**Use Cases**:
- Detailed NGO stakeholder mapping for international donors assessing the influence networks of Brazilian river basin advocates
- Academic research pipeline for profiling faith-based environmental leaders in Northeastern Brazil for a peer-reviewed journal
- Investigative journalism toolkit for generating in-depth biographical and religious context on Sobradinho Dam displacement campaigners
- Government transparency dashboard automating reports on civil society leaders’ backgrounds and religious affiliations in water management forums
- CRM enrichment module for a nonprofit’s outreach team, adding religious and biographical metadata to community leader contacts in Alagoas
- Legal discovery support for lawyers representing dam-displaced families, extracting advocates’ personal profiles and faith-based motivations
- Digital humanities project to visualize religious terminology frequency and leadership transitions within CBHSF historical archives
- Targeted social media influencer identification for an environmental campaign, filtering profiles of local faith leaders engaged in river advocacy
