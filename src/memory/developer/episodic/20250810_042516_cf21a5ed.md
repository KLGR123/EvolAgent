### Development Step 1: Identify countries with gross savings >35% of GDP (2001–2010), list names alphabetically, comma-separated.

**Description**: Retrieve gross savings as a percentage of GDP (indicator NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS) for all countries for each year from 2001 through 2010 using the World Bank API, then filter the dataset to identify countries whose gross savings value exceeds 35% for every year in that period, extract their English country names, sort them alphabetically, and prepare a comma-separated list.

**Use Cases**:
- Identifying target countries for international investment funds seeking consistently high national savings rates from 2001–2010
- Supporting academic research on the correlation between high gross savings and economic growth by providing a filtered list of relevant countries
- Assisting global development agencies in benchmarking fiscal policy effectiveness by isolating countries with sustained high savings as a percentage of GDP
- Enabling multinational banks to focus market entry analysis on economies with robust domestic savings pools for retail banking expansion
- Facilitating macroeconomic risk assessment for insurance companies by highlighting countries with stable, high gross savings over a decade
- Automating the selection of case study countries for policy think tanks analyzing long-term savings behavior and its impact on financial stability
- Streamlining the creation of educational materials for economics courses by providing real-world examples of countries with exceptional savings performance
- Powering data-driven journalism projects that visualize and compare savings trends across nations for public awareness campaigns
