### Development Step 7: Locate Emily Midkiff’s June 2014 Dragon Depiction Article in a Journal Named After Hreidmar’s Son

**Description**: Search for information about Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article, focusing on identifying the journal named after one of Hreidmar's sons from Norse mythology. Research Hreidmar's sons (Fafnir, Regin, and Otr) to determine which one has a journal named after them, then locate Midkiff's specific article from June 2014 that discusses dragon depictions and contains quotes from two different authors expressing distaste.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal contract clause search and extraction across HTML-based contract repositories for law firms to streamline due diligence
- Clinical guideline retrieval by scanning saved medical HTML pages for protocol names, dates, and author citations in healthcare compliance audits
- DevOps log scanning and pattern matching in exported HTML error reports to quickly locate recurring JavaScript exceptions and performance issues
- University thesis database mining to locate specific researcher names and publication years in archived HTML records for academic literature reviews
- Museum exhibition catalog indexing by searching artifact descriptions in HTML archives to tag items based on mythological or historical references
- Customer service email template extraction by locating key phrases and support article links in exported HTML archives for building an updated FAQ knowledge base
- Corporate website compliance monitoring by scanning HTML pages for outdated GDPR policy mentions and generating a prioritized remediation list
- Intellectual property analysis by finding inventor names and patent numbers in downloaded HTML patent documents for R&D departments to track emerging technologies
