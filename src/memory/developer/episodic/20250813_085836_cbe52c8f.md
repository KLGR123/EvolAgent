### Development Step 19: Identify ‘Little Monsters’ Comic Illustrator and Their Collaborations with Writers

**Description**: Search for information about the comic book 'Little Monsters' to identify its illustrator/artist. Focus on finding the artist who illustrated this comic and any information about their collaborations with writers. Look for official publication details, creator credits, and any collaborative relationships mentioned in connection with this work.

**Use Cases**:
- Comic publishers automating metadata enrichment by extracting illustrator and writer credits from online comic store HTML listings for accurate digital catalog updates
- IP law firms conducting due diligence by scraping multiple comic archive pages to verify artist attributions and collaboration details in trademark disputes
- Library archival systems processing vintage comic book web pages to extract artist names and publication data for enhanced catalog records and discovery
- Fan-driven wikis auto-updating creator profiles by parsing search results and identifying the artist behind niche comics like “Little Monsters” for comprehensive community databases
- Academic researchers mapping collaboration networks of comic book creators by scraping historical web archives and extracting illustrator–writer relationships for social network analysis
- E-commerce platforms improving SEO and product detail accuracy by automatically pulling illustrator credits from HTML pages of collectible comic book listings
- Cultural heritage projects digitizing comic art collections and extracting provenance information from historical web pages to preserve artist attribution and publication context
- Publishing workflow automation integrating HTML parsing scripts into continuous integration pipelines to validate and update artist credits in new comic release metadata
