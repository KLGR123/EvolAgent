### Development Step 7: Which consecrator of Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara never became pope?

**Description**: Determine which of the three individuals involved in Cardinal Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara's episcopal consecration never became pope. Research the papal history of: (1) Pope Clement VIII (the principal consecrator), (2) Camillo Cardinal Borghese (co-consecrator), and (3) Alfonso Visconti (co-consecrator). Identify which of these three individuals never achieved papal office and provide that person's name as the final answer.

**Use Cases**:
- Episcopal lineage mapping and consecrator status verification for digital humanities projects
- Automated validation of consecration records and papal status for Catholic university research databases
- Fact-checking and historical accuracy assessment for religious publishing houses producing church history volumes
- Interactive timeline generation and metadata enrichment for museum exhibits on papal consecrations
- Curriculum content creation and quiz generation on church hierarchy for theological e-learning platforms
- Archival cataloging automation and metadata tagging for Vatican library digitization initiatives
- Genealogical analysis of ecclesiastical family connections and consecrator-papal relationships for historical societies
- Canon law research support and pre-publication review of legal documents referencing episcopal consecrations
