### Development Step 5: Determine Production Company of Becky Sharp, First Full-Length Three-Strip Technicolor Film

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the first full-length color film using three-strip Technicolor titled 'Becky Sharp' and determine which company produced it. Search for keywords including 'Becky Sharp 1935 three-strip Technicolor producer', 'first full-length Technicolor film production company', 'Becky Sharp movie producer studio', and 'three-strip Technicolor Becky Sharp who produced'. Focus on identifying the specific production company or studio that created this pioneering color film to establish which company employed the composer we need to identify.

**Use Cases**:
- Film historian conducting archival research to pinpoint the production company behind Becky Sharp (1935) for a journal article on early Technicolor milestones
- Music licensing analyst automating web searches to identify studio contracts and composer employment details for royalty clearance of vintage film scores
- Documentary producer compiling accurate production credits and studio affiliations of pioneering color films to secure archival footage permissions
- Digital humanities researcher aggregating metadata on three-strip Technicolor titles for an interactive university database of film technology innovations
- Entertainment law firm verifying producer and studio ownership information to support litigation over classic film distribution rights
- Streaming service content curator building a themed catalog of early Technicolor films by extracting production company and producer data for audience marketing
- Cultural heritage archivist annotating digitized film reels with verified studio provenance details to enhance museum exhibition records

Promising results that need proper analysis:

- Merian C. Cooper page mentioning Pioneer Pictures
- File reference with Kenneth Macgowan as producer
- Multiple references to Pioneer Pictures connection
