### Development Step 3: Identify Jacques Marquetteâ€™s Chicago landmark: construction, significance, and architectural firm

**Description**: Research the namesake of Marquette, Michigan to identify the historical figure the city was named after. Then search for landmark buildings in Chicago named after this same person. Focus on finding: (1) The historical namesake of Marquette, Michigan (likely Jacques Marquette, the French missionary and explorer), (2) Buildings or structures in Chicago named after this person, (3) The specific landmark building and its architectural details. Extract information about when the building was constructed, its significance, and most importantly, which architectural firm designed it.

**Use Cases**:
- Tourism app enrichment using namesake research and landmark architecture details to create interactive city guides for Marquette and Chicago
- Historical network analysis automating extraction of explorer biographies and related building metadata to study cultural impact across US cities
- Heritage conservation database automation gathering construction dates, architectural firms, and significance of monuments named after Jacques Marquette in Chicago
- Journalism feature research automating the collection of architectural firm details and historical context for articles on explorer-named buildings
- Real estate marketing automating inclusion of landmark building histories and architect information in property descriptions near the Marquette Building
- Educational software development integrating namesake origins and landmark architecture info to build interactive learning modules on French exploration
- Museum exhibit curation automating compilation of eponymous structure profiles, architects, and historical significance for digital displays on Jacques Marquette
- GIS platform augmentation by ingesting eponymous landmark metadata and architectural details into urban mapping layers for Chicago heritage planning
