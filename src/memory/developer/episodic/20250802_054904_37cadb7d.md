- Academic literature harvesting for systematic reviews, automatically searching titles and downloading full-text papers into research repositories
- Competitive intelligence gathering by marketing departments, scanning for and grabbing whitepapers or case studies from targeted companies
- Engineering teams collecting product manuals and technical datasheets from manufacturer websites by querying exact document titles
- Healthcare analytics workflows that fetch and archive clinical guideline PDFs (e.g., WHO protocols) for integration into decision-support systems
- Patent search automation in R&D, locating precise patent titles and downloading the corresponding PDF files for novelty assessment
- Environmental science projects scraping government and NGO reports (e.g., climate impact assessments) directly into analysis workspaces
