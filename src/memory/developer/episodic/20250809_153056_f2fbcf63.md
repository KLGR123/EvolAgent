### Development Step 11: Identify the 2002 Iraq regime-change bill co-sponsored by Cox and Jeff Sessions’ 2005 speech venue.

**Description**: Research the 2002 legislation that was repealed by the U.S. Senate in 2023, had unresolved House legislative status, was co-sponsored by Christopher Cox, aimed to support regime change through opposition groups, and targeted a certain leader. Identify this specific measure that Jeff Sessions spoke in favor of, then determine where he delivered a speech about this legislation in 2005.

**Use Cases**:
- Think-tank foreign policy analysts automating extraction of AUMF legislative history and sponsor data to generate monthly policy briefings
- Congressional research staff monitoring real-time status changes of regime-change authorizations and co-sponsor trends for leadership memos
- Journalists integrating automated legislative scraping to fact-check politicians’ claims on Iraq policy during news cycles
- Legal compliance teams cross-referencing repealed military authorizations and sponsorship records to update corporate regulatory dashboards
- Academic researchers building datasets of US foreign policy resolutions and speech venues for quantitative political science studies
- Nonprofit advocacy groups tracking shifts in representative support for human rights legislation by analyzing roll-call votes and co-sponsorship patterns
- Defense contractor intelligence units mapping key speech locations and legislative actions to inform strategic lobbying and bid proposals
