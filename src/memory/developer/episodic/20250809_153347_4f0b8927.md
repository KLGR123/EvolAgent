### Development Step 18: Identify 2002 regime-change measure co-sponsored by Christopher Cox and where Sessions spoke in 2005

**Description**: Research the 2002 legislation that was repealed by the U.S. Senate in 2023, had unresolved House legislative status, was co-sponsored by Christopher Cox, aimed to support regime change through opposition groups, and targeted a certain leader. Identify this specific measure that Jeff Sessions spoke in favor of, then determine where he delivered a speech about this legislation in 2005.

**Use Cases**:
- Legislative tracking and repeal monitoring for policy research organizations: automate identification of outdated AUMFs, co-sponsor verification, and 2023 repeal details to keep policy databases current
- Political event analytics for media outlets: scrape and structure data on senators’ 2005 Iraq-war speeches (e.g., Heritage Foundation) to enrich news coverage with venue and context metadata
- Compliance intelligence for legal consultancies: compile legislative histories, sponsor roles, and repeal actions into JSON and summary reports for client advisories on military authorization risks
- Academic case study compilation for political science researchers: extract bill metadata, sponsorship networks, and speech contexts into structured datasets to support scholarly analysis of regime-change legislation
- Lobbying strategy briefs for government affairs teams: generate timelines of congressional resolutions, identify key co-sponsors like Christopher Cox, and map speech venues to inform advocacy planning
- Archival automation for university law libraries: scrape legislation texts, sponsor information, and related speech transcripts, then convert into standardized JSON and summary files for digital repositories
- Investigative journalism data pipeline for policy reporters: consolidate multi-source legislative data and speech location details to create interactive visualizations of the 2002 Iraq AUMF and its 2023 repeal
- E-learning content generation for civic education platforms: produce concise, structured case summaries of the 2002 Iraq resolution and Jeff Sessions’ 2005 speech for interactive online lessons
