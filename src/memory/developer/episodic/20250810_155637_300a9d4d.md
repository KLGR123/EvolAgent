### Development Step 13: Connect Victorian-era Surrey Lodge to Developer Organization and Founder’s Birth Year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Nonprofit grant writing: extract historical organization and founder birth year from archival research to strengthen heritage funding proposals
- Heritage property conservation: identify the original developer and founder’s biography to guide restoration and compliance reports
- Academic history research: automate JSON/text analysis of Victorian-era archives to map fraternal society origins and founders for scholarly articles
- Museum exhibit curation: link lodge development organization details and founder life dates to create accurate local heritage displays
- Urban planning heritage assessment: verify Surrey Lodge’s founding organization and founder lineage for protected building status applications
- Legal due diligence in real estate: extract and confirm founding organization and individual credentials from research data during title dispute resolution
- Digital humanities database enrichment: automate discovery of Victorian-era society founders and birth years to populate online cultural heritage repositories
