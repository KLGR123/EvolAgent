### Development Step 5: Identify the East German 1983 Malko Competition Winner and Extract First Name “Claus”

**Description**: Analyze the extracted Malko Competition data from workspace files to identify the specific winner from East Germany and extract their first name. Focus on the 1983 winner Claus Peter who was identified as being from East Germany (a country that no longer exists). Verify this is the only recipient from the specified time period whose nationality corresponds to a defunct country, and extract the first name 'Claus' as the answer to the task.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum archival cataloging of Cold War–era music competitions: scanning digitized archives for award data, filtering recipients by defunct nations like East Germany, and extracting first names (e.g., “Claus”) for exhibition metadata.
- Historical music competition database maintenance in a cultural institute: automating file ingestion, identifying winners from former countries, and populating a structured database field with their given names for accurate record-keeping.
- Academic research on Cold War cultural events: processing workspace text and JSON files to isolate participants with East German nationality in 1983, extract “Claus” as a case study, and prepare datasets for scholarly publications.
- Legal compliance for cultural heritage repatriation: analyzing archives of competition results to verify awardees’ nationalities from defunct states, extract individual names to support restitution claims, and generate audit trails.
- Digital library metadata enrichment: parsing diverse file formats of competition records, detecting entries from abolished countries, and appending first names to catalog records for enhanced search and discovery.
- Automated executive reporting for music industry analytics: scanning project directories for competition winner files, identifying unique nationalities (East Germany), extracting first names, and summarizing findings in management dashboards.
- Government cultural policy documentation: reviewing historical award data stored in workspace files to confirm single occurrences of recipients from defunct nations, extract their names, and include them in policy evaluation reports.
- Genealogical research tool development: building scripts to comb through public record files for individuals linked to former countries, isolate award winners like Claus Peter, and capture given names for family-history databases.
