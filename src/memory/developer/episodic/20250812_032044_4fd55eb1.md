### Development Step 13: Who introduced December 1897 $25 soldier’s pension Act benefiting Auburn Methodist Episcopal Church South founder

**Description**: Research the December 1897 legislation that granted $25 monthly soldier's pensions to identify who introduced the specific bill that benefited the Civil War veteran who established the Auburn Methodist Episcopal Church South Mission in 1903. Focus on Congressional records from December 1897, particularly the Disability Pension Act or related veteran pension legislation. Search for the bill's sponsor, co-sponsors, and legislative history to determine which member of Congress introduced this pension legislation that ultimately benefited the Auburn institution founder.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogy and veteran benefits verification through automated extraction of 19th-century pension act sponsors and beneficiary data for family historians
- Academic historical analysis and quantitative mapping of Congressional sponsorship trends of Civil War pension legislation for political science research
- Local history archiving and digital exhibition preparation by scraping and cleaning historical congressional records and newspaper archives for museum curators
- Policy research and comparative study of veteran welfare amendments by programmatic retrieval of legislative texts and sponsor metadata for public policy students
- Digital humanities curation and interactive timeline construction of 1897 disability pension acts by integrating extracted chronologies from Library of Congress and GovInfo sources
- Archival cataloging automation and indexing of Methodist Episcopal Church South mission founders’ pension histories by mining denominational and county historical databases
- Government archival management and primary source organization for congressional pension legislation by deploying scheduled web scrapers across multiple federal record repositories
