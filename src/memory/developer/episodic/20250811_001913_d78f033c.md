### Development Step 10: Solve an anagram to reveal a famous 100-letter line from Shakespeareâ€™s Hamlet.

**Description**: Solve the anagram by rearranging the letters from 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten' to find the original Shakespeare line from Hamlet that this phrase represents. Focus on identifying one of Shakespeare's most well-known lines from the tragedy, ensuring all 100 letters are used exactly once in the rearrangement.

**Use Cases**:
- Literary puzzle competitions where participants must reconstruct famous quotes from complex anagrams for educational or entertainment purposes
- Automated grading of creative writing assignments in university English courses, verifying studentsâ€™ ability to identify and reconstruct Shakespearean lines from scrambled text
- Digital humanities research projects analyzing textual variants and word frequency distributions in classic literature using computational anagram solving
- Interactive museum exhibits that challenge visitors to solve literary anagrams and learn about Shakespeareâ€™s works through hands-on activities
- Quality assurance for publishing houses, ensuring accurate reproduction of famous literary quotes in print and digital media by matching letter frequencies
- Escape room game design involving cryptic anagram clues that unlock narrative elements based on famous lines from Hamlet
- AI-powered chatbot development for educational platforms, allowing students to practice literary analysis and anagram solving in real time
- Archival restoration projects where damaged or incomplete texts are reconstructed by matching letter patterns and frequencies to known literary sources
