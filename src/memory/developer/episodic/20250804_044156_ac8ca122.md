### Development Step 22: Extract Survivor US Winners for Seasons 1–44 and Save to JSON

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Reality TV analytics dashboard development for entertainment networks, enabling insights into winner demographics and season trends using the structured JSON data
- Fan engagement chatbot integration on Survivor community platforms, automatically answering trivia and winner-related queries in real time
- Academic research in competition dynamics, using extracted Survivor winners data to analyze patterns in player success across 44 seasons
- Automated digital journalism workflows, generating infographics and timeline articles of Survivor winners for online publications
- Voice assistant skill creation for Alexa and Google Assistant, delivering instant responses about Survivor season winners from the JSON dataset
- Social media sentiment correlation analysis, mapping fan reactions on Twitter and Reddit to each Survivor winner for targeted marketing strategies
- Digital archive curation in cultural studies, incorporating structured winner metadata into entertainment heritage repositories for future scholarship
- Coding workshops and hackathons, teaching students web scraping techniques and JSON data handling by replicating the Survivor winners extraction process
