### Development Step 2: Indiana’s First Governor, 23.6-Mile I-65 Naming Resolution, and 1783 County Origins

**Description**: Research Indiana's first governor to identify who this person was, then search for information about a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 that was named in their honor. Focus on finding when the Indiana legislative body passed the resolution to designate this highway section. Additionally, identify which Indiana county was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 to determine the specific location of this Interstate 65 section.

**Use Cases**:
- State transportation departments automating extraction of legislative resolutions and highway naming details to update GIS asset databases and ensure accurate route signage
- Historical societies compiling interconnected colonial-era county boundaries and modern infrastructure designations for curated museum exhibits and educational materials
- Urban planners integrating memorial highway designations and legislative history into comprehensive city development reports and public consultation documents
- Academic researchers conducting comparative analyses of state commemorative practices by correlating governors’ tenures with named transportation corridors and passage dates
- Newsrooms generating enriched multimedia timelines for feature articles on infrastructure naming controversies by programmatically retrieving legislative records and historical county data
- Legal teams verifying the legislative authority and specific dates behind highway naming agreements to support compliance audits and drafting of municipal ordinances
- Tourism app developers embedding contextual historical narratives—such as colonial county origins and governor memorial dedications—into driving route guides to enhance traveler engagement
