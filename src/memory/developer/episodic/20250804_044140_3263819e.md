### Development Step 21: Extract Survivor (US) Seasons 1–44 Winners from Wikipedia into JSON File

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated entertainment website updater: dynamically generate and publish a “Survivor Winners” leaderboard on a fan portal, ensuring the list of seasons 1–44 is always current without manual edits.
- Diversity trend analysis for media researchers: extract winner names and cross-reference with demographic data (gender, age, ethnicity) to visualize shifts in diversity across 44 seasons.
- Predictive modeling for reality-TV analysts: feed the historical winners JSON into a machine learning pipeline to identify factors that correlate with winning and forecast likely champions in upcoming seasons.
- Trivia mobile app content generation: auto-populate quiz questions (e.g., “Who won Survivor Season 12?”) and maintain an up-to-date question bank as new seasons air.
- Streaming service recommendation engine: use the winners list to tag and recommend popular or critically acclaimed seasons (based on winner notoriety) for viewers seeking “best of Survivor.”
- Social media campaign scheduler for broadcasters: programmatically create anniversary posts celebrating each season’s winner on their respective premiere dates.
- Academic research on reality-TV longevity: integrate the JSON data into time-series studies exploring how show outcomes evolve over decades, correlating with format changes or audience trends.
- Chatbot knowledge base enrichment: feed the survivor_winners_list.json into a fan-engagement bot so it can answer “Who won Survivor Season 17?” in real time.
