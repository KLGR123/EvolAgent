### Development Step 24: Extract Survivor (US) Winners Seasons 1–44 from Wikipedia into JSON

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated population of a Survivor fan website’s “All Winners” page by pulling seasons 1–44 winner data into its CMS workflow
- Backend data feed for a TV trivia chatbot that answers “Who won Survivor season X?” in real time using the extracted JSON
- Historical ratings analysis dashboard correlating each season’s winner with Nielsen viewership trends for media analytics teams
- Academic study on reality TV outcomes, enabling sociologists to merge winner demographics with season archives for statistical research
- Mobile app feature delivering a searchable timeline of Survivor champions, auto-updating as new seasons air
- Interactive news graphic for an entertainment journalism piece, visualizing the progression of winners across 44 seasons
- Marketing campaign planner for a brand collaboration, aligning promotional events with high-profile Survivor winners based on extracted data
- Quality-assurance pipeline in a data engineering team that validates weekly updates of Survivor winners against the live Wikipedia table
