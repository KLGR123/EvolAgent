### Development Step 5: Identify Indiaâ€™s Prime Minister in April 1977 Using Reputable Historical Sources

**Description**: Research who was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977. Use reputable historical sources to identify the political leadership of India during this specific time period. Focus on determining who held the position of Prime Minister in India following any elections, transitions, or political events that occurred in or before April 1977.

**Use Cases**:
- Curriculum development for history educators to automatically fetch and verify the Prime Minister of India during specific periods, ensuring lesson plans reflect accurate leadership timelines
- Political science research platform integrating automated date-based queries to analyze the impact of leadership changes (e.g., comparing policy shifts before and after April 1977)
- Newsroom fact-checking tool that pulls verified archival data on heads of government for contextual reporting on historical articles or anniversary stories
- Government archives digitization project that scripts bulk extraction of ministerial tenures into JSON, enabling searchable databases of leadership transitions
- Museum interactive kiosk software that provides visitors with on-demand historical profiles of world leaders, including Indian Prime Ministers by month and year
- Policy think tank dashboard aggregating term-start and end dates of national leaders to correlate economic indicators with political regimes
- Historical timeline visualization service for documentary filmmakers to plot precise dates of officeholders, such as identifying the first non-Congress Prime Minister in April 1977
