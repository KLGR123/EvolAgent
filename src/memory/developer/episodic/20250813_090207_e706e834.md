### Development Step 30: Identify ‘Little Monsters’ Comic Book Artist and Their Collaborations with Writers

**Description**: Search for information about the comic book 'Little Monsters' to identify its illustrator/artist. Focus on finding the artist who illustrated this comic and any information about their collaborations with writers. Look for official publication details, creator credits, and any collaborative relationships mentioned in connection with this work.

**Use Cases**:
- Comic historian conducting archival research to accurately attribute the illustrator of the 1960s Little Monsters series for an academic paper on Gold Key Comics
- Intellectual property lawyer performing due-diligence on artist credits and collaboration details before negotiating reprint licensing for vintage comic properties
- Digital archivist enriching a library’s comic book metadata by extracting creator names and collaboration contexts for cataloguing and discovery
- Publisher’s editorial team verifying original artist and writer credits in preparation for a deluxe reprint edition of Little Monsters
- Fan-run database curator building a searchable index of Golden Age comic creators, linking each Little Monsters issue to its illustrator and writer
- Data scientist analyzing patterns of artist-writer collaborations across mid-century comics to model social networks in the comic book industry
- Machine learning engineer compiling a labeled dataset of comic pages annotated with artist and writer credits to train attribution and OCR models
- Cultural studies researcher mapping the evolution of illustration styles by aggregating and analyzing artist credits from Little Monsters and related Gold Key series
