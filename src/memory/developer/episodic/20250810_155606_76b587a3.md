### Development Step 11: Surrey Lodge’s Victorian Developer: Organization, Founder, and Founder’s Birth Year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Victorian heritage grant application: automatically extract the original development organization and founder’s birth year from archival research files to support a grant proposal for Surrey Lodge restoration
- Academic architectural history research: process JSON and text summaries to identify the organization that built Surrey Lodge and its founder’s biography for a doctoral dissertation on Victorian-era developments
- Museum exhibit curation: ingest historical research data to source accurate founder details and birth year for interpretive signage on South London heritage sites
- Genealogical investigations: parse workspace research files to uncover founder names and birth years, enriching family trees connected to Surrey Lodge’s development organization
- Local council planning compliance: extract developer organization and founder information from archived reports to certify conservation area designations and planning applications
- Real estate marketing for heritage properties: generate provenance narratives by pulling founder and organization data from research JSON and text summaries for luxury Victorian listings
- Digital archives management: integrate the extraction workflow into a content management system to index organization and founder metadata across multiple heritage site research files
- Legal due diligence in property transactions: analyze summary reports and JSON data to verify the original developer organization and founder’s birth year for title history documentation
