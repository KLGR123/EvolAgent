### Development Step 37: Identify Pre-1999 Fiona Apple and Paula Cole Albums Without Christgau Letter Grades

**Description**: Analyze the research results from workspace/christgau_comprehensive_final_complete_20250803_040620.json to determine which pre-1999 Fiona Apple and Paula Cole albums did NOT receive letter grades from Robert Christgau. Cross-reference the complete list of pre-1999 albums identified earlier with the Christgau review findings to identify albums that were either not reviewed or did not receive letter grades. Create the final alphabetized, comma-delimited list of album titles that didn't receive Christgau letter grades.

**Use Cases**:
- Music archiving teams integrating automated review checks into library management systems to flag pre-1999 Fiona Apple and Paula Cole albums lacking Robert Christgau letter grades for catalog completeness
- Academic researchers in musicology cross-referencing discographies with Christgau’s reviews to study critical reception gaps in ’90s female singer-songwriter releases for a peer-reviewed journal article
- Digital music streaming platforms implementing metadata quality assurance workflows that detect and tag albums missing authoritative Christgau ratings before public release
- Entertainment analytics companies generating completeness reports from critic datasets to identify ungraded albums in their rock criticism database, prioritizing them for manual review
- Online music encyclopedias automating editorial pipelines to highlight entries of pre-1999 records without Christgau letter grades, streamlining content enrichment workflows
- University libraries auditing their special collections of ’90s alternative albums to ensure all items have documented critical assessments, using JSON analysis to detect missing reviews
- Record label archival departments auditing legacy catalogs to identify unreviewed Fiona Apple and Paula Cole releases, supporting retrospective marketing and reissue campaigns with comprehensive press notes
