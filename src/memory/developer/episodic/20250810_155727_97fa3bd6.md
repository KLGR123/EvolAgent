### Development Step 16: Identify Surrey Lodge Developer Organization and Founder’s Birth Year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogical research firms automating founder identification from archival JSON and text repositories to accelerate validation of family lineage linked to fraternal organizations
- Museum curation teams extracting organizational founders and establishment dates for Victorian-era societies to enrich exhibit metadata and digital collections
- Legal due diligence platforms verifying historical property ownership by parsing research files for founders’ names and birth years in heritage estate transactions
- Academic historians running automated pipelines to cross-validate digital research outputs and generate structured biographies of 18th-century society founders
- Cultural heritage mobile apps ingesting verified JSON outputs to display founder biographies and lodge histories for self-guided Victorian-era sightseeing tours
- Nonprofit grant writers compiling evidence-backed organizational backgrounds and founder details to strengthen funding applications for preservation projects
- Digital humanities platforms integrating structured data on fraternal lodges and founders into linked open data knowledge graphs for public research
- Historical preservation consultants generating compliance-ready reports by extracting and summarizing key organizational and founder information from research artifacts
