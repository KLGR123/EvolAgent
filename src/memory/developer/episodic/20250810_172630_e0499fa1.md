### Development Step 3: First Indiana governor honored I-65 segment: resolution date and county location

**Description**: Research Indiana's first governor to identify who this person was, then search for information about a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 that was named in their honor. Focus on finding when the Indiana legislative body passed the resolution to designate this highway section. Additionally, identify which Indiana county was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 to determine the specific location of this Interstate 65 section.

**Use Cases**:
- State Department of Transportation automating extraction of legislative resolutions and generating signage metadata for highway renaming ceremonies
- State archives and historical society compiling JSON-based research summaries on Indiana governors and county origins for digital exhibit catalogs
- Legal analysts cross-referencing colonial charter records with modern legislative acts to audit jurisdictional changes and boundary formations
- GIS specialists overlaying 1783 Virginia county boundaries with current I-65 route data to support infrastructure planning and mapping projects
- Educational content developers producing interactive timelines and lesson plans on Indiana statehood and highway naming using structured research outputs
- Journalists automating the extraction of key facts from legislative documents and search results to generate rapid news briefs on state government actions
- Genealogists correlating 18th-century land claims in Jefferson County, Virginia with present-day Clark County, Indiana through JSON-driven data pipelines
