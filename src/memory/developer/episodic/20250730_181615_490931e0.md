### Development Step 3: Search for Valentina Re’s Metalepsis, Horror, Dream Worlds Chapter in ‘World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries’

**Description**: Conduct a web search for the book "World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries" (2017) edited by Marta Boni, focusing on Valentina Re's chapter or contribution. Look specifically for information about metalepsis, horror movies, dream worlds and reality in Valentina Re's work.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic literature review automation for film studies researchers analyzing metalepsis in horror and dream narratives of Valentina Re’s chapter
- Library catalog metadata enrichment for university librarians integrating detailed chapter titles, author contributions, and thematic keywords into OPAC systems
- Horror movie blog content generation using contextual quotes about metalepsis, dream worlds, and reality to enhance analytical articles
- E-learning course module creation for media studies instructors auto-populating lesson plans on transmedia narrative structures and narrative level transgressions
- Digital humanities research pipeline for thematic text mining of academic publications, extracting contexts around metalepsis, horror, and dream sequences
- Knowledge graph development for scholarly publishers linking book chapters, contributor profiles, and conceptual themes (e.g., metalepsis, reality boundaries)
- Automated bibliography and citation management for graduate students compiling precise publication data and chapter-level references on world-building studies
- Entertainment industry insights dashboard for analysts tracking academic discourse on horror film narrative techniques and dream-reality interplay
