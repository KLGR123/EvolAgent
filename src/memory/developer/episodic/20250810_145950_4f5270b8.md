### Development Step 27: Determine Australian captain in Test where Arthur Morris scored 300+ runs before 1973‚Äì74.

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Patent prior-art verification for intellectual property firms, automating JSON-based search of patent databases to confirm whether a specific technical feature (e.g., ‚Äúbiodegradable polymer formulation‚Äù) appears in earlier filings and summarizing evidence for invalidation or support.
- Clinical trial efficacy validation for pharmaceutical researchers, ingesting JSON results from medical publications to locate mentions of drug response rates (e.g., ‚Äú50% remission‚Äù) and produce a detailed report that verifies or refutes claimed outcomes.
- Regulatory compliance auditing for banking institutions, parsing JSON audit logs and external examiner reports to extract capital ratio references, compare them against mandated thresholds, and flag discrepancies with a conclusive analysis.
- Social media moderation performance review, scanning JSON logs of user content and moderation decisions to identify misclassified hate speech or policy-violating posts, then generating actionable insights to refine automated filters.
- Competitive retail intelligence for merchandising teams, collecting JSON catalog data and customer reviews from rival e-commerce sites to detect products boasting ‚Äú5,000+ five-star reviews,‚Äù verify those counts, and produce a validated leaderboard of top sellers.
- Legal e-discovery and privilege checking for litigation support services, iterating through JSON-indexed email and document repositories to find communications labeled ‚Äúattorney-client,‚Äù confirm date ranges and parties involved, and output a final privilege log.
- Academic meta-analysis curation for research institutions, harvesting JSON abstracts from multiple journals to pinpoint studies reporting ‚Äúalpha diversity > 2.5,‚Äù extract methodological details, and compile a rigorously verified dataset for downstream statistical modeling.
