### Development Step 1: Extract and Count Unavailable Rick Riordan Titles from Scribe County Public Library PDF Data

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/e9a2c537-8232-4c3f-85b0-b52de6bcba99.pdf to extract the complete book collection data from Scribe County Public Library. Identify all books authored by Rick Riordan in the collection, then determine their current availability status by checking which ones are marked as checked out, on hold, or otherwise not currently available on the library shelves. Calculate the total count of Rick Riordan books that are not physically present on the shelves.

**Use Cases**:
- Library inventory auditing and shelf maintenance by parsing monthly PDF catalogs to identify Rick Riordan titles that are missing or checked out
- Academic research on student reading habits by extracting circulation status of Rick Riordan books from university library PDF reports
- Children’s literacy outreach planning by analyzing public library PDF holdings to find unavailable popular youth titles and schedule bookmobile visits
- Book retailer supply chain automation by parsing supplier-provided PDF inventory lists to detect out-of-stock Rick Riordan titles and trigger reorder processes
- Public policy assessment by aggregating multiple county library PDF catalogs to evaluate regional access to children’s literature for grant applications
- Educational platform content curation by scraping library PDF records to flag unavailable Rick Riordan books for digital licensing and e-book integration
- Nonprofit donation program optimization by monitoring PDF-based library inventories to calculate shortages of Rick Riordan titles and direct book drive efforts
