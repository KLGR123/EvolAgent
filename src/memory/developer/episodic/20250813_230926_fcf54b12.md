### Development Step 11: Title: Identify the Word Deleted in the Most Recent Amendment to Rule 701 Using Cornell LII Website

**Description**: Access Rule 701 (Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses) on Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website and examine its complete amendment history to identify the most recent amendment. Extract the specific text changes made in the last amendment to determine what word was deleted from the rule. Focus on comparing the before and after versions of the rule text to identify the exact word that was removed.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal research automation for law firms needing to track and document precise changes in Federal Rules of Evidence for case preparation and compliance audits
- Academic analysis by legal scholars studying the evolution of evidentiary rules, enabling citation of exact language modifications and their rationale in scholarly articles
- Judicial training programs developing up-to-date educational materials for judges and court staff, highlighting the latest amendments and their practical implications
- Compliance teams at corporations ensuring internal legal guidelines reflect the most current federal evidence standards by programmatically detecting and summarizing rule changes
- Legal publishing companies updating annotated rulebooks and digital platforms with detailed amendment histories and the specific language edits, such as word deletions
- Litigation support services generating amendment comparison reports for expert witnesses or attorneys preparing motions that rely on the current text of evidentiary rules
