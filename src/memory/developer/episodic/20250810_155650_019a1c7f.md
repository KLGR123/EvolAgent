### Development Step 14: Identify Surrey Lodge developer organization and founder‚Äôs birth year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Heritage conservation research and automated founder identification for historical building restoration projects
- Corporate due diligence and founder verification in mergers and acquisitions workflows
- Museum exhibit curation and founder biography extraction for interactive visitor guides
- Local government tourism marketing and historical narrative creation for heritage landmarks
- Nonprofit organization lineage mapping and founder birth-year discovery for archival databases
- Academic genealogical study automation and pattern-based extraction of ancestor founders
- Digital archiving of architectural records with automated metadata enrichment on founders and establishment dates
- Legal property title research and foundational history validation for urban planning and land registry purposes
