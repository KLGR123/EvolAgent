### Development Step 16: Find and Confirm Greg Chappell‚Äôs Death Date and Year from Reliable Sources

**Description**: Search for information about when Greg Chappell passed away. Focus on finding his death date and year, using search terms including 'Greg Chappell death date', 'Greg Chappell died year', 'Greg Chappell obituary', and 'Greg Chappell Australian cricketer death'. Verify the information from reliable sources such as cricket databases, news archives, or official cricket organizations.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports heritage museums verifying the living status of former cricket players before updating digital hall-of-fame exhibits
- News wire services automatically fact-checking obituaries for prominent figures against archived web pages and official cricket databases
- Genealogy software tools cross-referencing online records to confirm ancestral death dates and avoid erroneous family tree entries
- CRM data cleansing workflows detecting deceased contacts by analyzing web content, obituaries, and official announcements to maintain accurate client lists
- Legal compliance systems validating whether individuals are alive before serving court documents or processing estate claims
- Insurance underwriting platforms automatically verifying applicant mortality status using public sports archives, news articles, and obituaries
- Academic research projects performing large-scale historical status validation of scientists, artists, and athletes by parsing web archives and biographies
