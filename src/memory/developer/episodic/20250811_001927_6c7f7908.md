### Development Step 12: Solve an anagram to reveal a famous 100-letter line from Shakespeareâ€™s Hamlet.

**Description**: Solve the anagram by rearranging the letters from 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten' to find the original Shakespeare line from Hamlet that this phrase represents. Focus on identifying one of Shakespeare's most well-known lines from the tragedy, ensuring all 100 letters are used exactly once in the rearrangement.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated grading of literature quizzes by verifying student solutions to Shakespearean anagram challenges
- Digital humanities research for reconstructing original texts from cryptic literary puzzles in historical archives
- Educational game development where players solve famous literary anagrams to unlock new levels or content
- Museum exhibit interactive kiosks that allow visitors to unscramble classic lines from Shakespeare using touchscreens
- Plagiarism detection in academic writing by matching rearranged text to canonical Shakespeare passages
- Content moderation tools for online forums that identify and flag disguised quotations from copyrighted works
- AI-powered chatbot assistants for English teachers that generate and validate anagram-based homework assignments
- Archival restoration projects that use letter frequency analysis to reconstruct damaged or incomplete Shakespeare manuscripts
