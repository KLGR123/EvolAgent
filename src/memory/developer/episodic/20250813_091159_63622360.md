### Development Step 50: Tracing J.K. Woodward’s Comic Collaborations to Bridge Star Trek Aliens and Jeff Lemire

**Description**: Search for collaborative relationships between J.K. Woodward (the Star Trek Aliens artist) and Jeff Lemire to verify the connection in the collaboration chain. Also search for any other writers who have worked with J.K. Woodward on comics, as this may reveal the specific writer who collaborates with an artist who collaborates with Jeff Lemire. Focus on finding concrete evidence of Woodward's collaborations beyond the Star Trek work to establish the missing link in the chain: Star Trek writer → Artist (who collaborates with Lemire) → Jeff Lemire → Andrea Sorrentino.

**Use Cases**:
- Verifying comic book creator networks by tracing collaboration chains between writers and artists to confirm published partnerships
- Conducting due diligence on research grant proposals by mapping co-authorship links among academic scientists
- Auditing open-source software projects to identify contributor interdependencies and collaboration pathways across repositories
- Mapping corporate joint ventures by analyzing partnership data between companies, subsidiaries, and key executives
- Tracking film industry collaborations by linking directors, cinematographers, and screenwriters to validate team credits
- Assessing influencer marketing strategies by uncovering co-created campaigns and content collaborations among social media personalities
- Evaluating patent filing networks in the tech industry by tracing inventor co-authorships to verify innovation partnerships
- Streamlining music production audits by mapping songwriter–producer–artist collaboration chains for royalty distribution checks
