## Analysis of Metalepsis in "A Nightmare on Elm Street"

In Valentina Re's chapter, she explores how {horror_movie['title']} created a landmark example of metalepsis by blurring the boundaries between dream world and reality. In the film, the villain Freddy Krueger can attack people in their dreams, and injuries sustained in the dream world manifest physically in reality.

This transgression of boundaries between fictional dream space and diegetic reality created a new paradigm for horror storytelling that has influenced many subsequent films in the genre. The metaleptic device creates horror through the violation of expected ontological boundaries - what happens in dreams should not affect physical reality, but in Craven's film, these levels become permeable, creating both narrative complexity and genuine terror.
