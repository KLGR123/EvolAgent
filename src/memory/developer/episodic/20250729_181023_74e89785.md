### Development Step 2: Identify Year David Sklar Introduced Innovation Reports Section in Academic Medicine Journal

**Description**: Search for information about David Sklar and Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine journal. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Direct search for 'David Sklar Innovation Reports Academic Medicine journal', (2) Search Academic Medicine journal archives or database for articles by David Sklar, (3) Search for 'Innovation Reports Academic Medicine introduction year', (4) Look for historical information about when Innovation Reports section was established in Academic Medicine. Focus on identifying the specific year when David Sklar introduced or established the Innovation Reports feature in this medical journal.

**Use Cases**:
- Competitive intelligence for product teams: parse search engine results and press release archives to pinpoint the exact year a rival company introduced a flagship feature, enabling data-driven roadmap planning.
- Academic editorial research: mine online journal archives and search metadata to determine when a specific section (e.g., “Case Studies”) was first established and credit the founding editor with publication details.
- Legal compliance tracking: analyze government websites and legal databases to extract the enactment year of a new regulation by detecting keywords like “enacted” or “established” in legal snippets.
- Patent analytics for R&D: aggregate patent office search results and automatically extract filing and grant years for key inventions in a target technology domain, ranking them by relevance.
- Marketing campaign monitoring: search news aggregators and corporate blogs to identify the introduction date of a major brand slogan or sustainability initiative, capturing launch year and source URLs.
- Public policy timeline building: scrape WHO, CDC, and other public health agency archives to confirm the publication year of critical guidelines, filtering for “published” or “launched” mentions in the text.
- Technical standards research: gather search results from ISO, IEEE, and industry consortium websites to establish when a new communication protocol or best practice standard was first released.
- Corporate heritage documentation: compile internal communications, annual reports, and press coverage to verify the inception year of a company’s flagship community outreach program, extracting evidence and timestamps.
