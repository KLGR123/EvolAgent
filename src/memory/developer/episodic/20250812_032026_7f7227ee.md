### Development Step 12: Sponsor of December 1897 Disability Pension Act Benefiting Auburn Methodist Church Founder

**Description**: Research the December 1897 legislation that granted $25 monthly soldier's pensions to identify who introduced the specific bill that benefited the Civil War veteran who established the Auburn Methodist Episcopal Church South Mission in 1903. Focus on Congressional records from December 1897, particularly the Disability Pension Act or related veteran pension legislation. Search for the bill's sponsor, co-sponsors, and legislative history to determine which member of Congress introduced this pension legislation that ultimately benefited the Auburn institution founder.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogical research automation for Civil War descendants tracking ancestral pension records and service details
- Legislative sponsor identification for political historians analyzing 19th-century veteran benefit bills and Congressional influences
- Digital archiving workflow for local historical societies to scrape and catalog 1897 pension legislation and newspaper references
- Automated data extraction for academic researchers studying post-Reconstruction social welfare policies and veteran support trends
- Church history curation for denominational archives documenting founders of Methodist Episcopal Church South missions and their federal pensions
- Legal precedent analysis for attorneys examining historical Disability Pension Acts and sponsor voting records in the 55th Congress
- Data-driven journalism investigation into the evolution of veteran benefits, correlating legislative sponsors with regional socioeconomic impact
- University special collections integration to cross-reference Auburn, Alabama archival materials with federal pension databases for campus exhibits
