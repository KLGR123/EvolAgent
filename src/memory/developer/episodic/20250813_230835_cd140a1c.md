### Development Step 5: Identifying the Federal Rules of Evidence Article with Most 'Witnesses' in Rule Titles and Analyzing Amendments

**Description**: Access the Federal Rules of Evidence section on Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website and systematically analyze all rules to identify which article has 'witnesses' appearing in the most rule titles as of 2021. Count the occurrences of 'witnesses' in titles across all Federal Rules of Evidence articles, then identify the article with the highest count for further analysis of its first rule's amendment history.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal research automation for law firms seeking to quickly identify which sections of the Federal Rules of Evidence most frequently address witnesses, streamlining case preparation and citation.
- Academic analysis by legal scholars studying the evolution and emphasis on witness-related rules across different articles for publication or curriculum development.
- Compliance auditing for court administrators verifying that local procedures align with the most witness-focused articles of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
- Development of legal tech tools that provide targeted guidance or alerts to attorneys when drafting motions or preparing for trial, based on the prominence of witness rules in specific articles.
- Judicial training program content creation, focusing on the articles with the highest concentration of witness-related rules to enhance judge and clerk education.
- Automated updating of legal knowledge bases for in-house counsel teams, ensuring that internal resources highlight the most relevant and frequently amended witness rules.
