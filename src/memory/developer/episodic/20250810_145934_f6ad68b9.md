### Development Step 26: Arthur Morris‚Äôs Pre-1973‚Äì74 300+ Test Innings and the Australian Captain

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Fact-checking investigative journalism claims by analyzing archived online news articles to verify if a public figure delivered speeches exceeding three hours, identifying the event date and moderator.
- Pharmaceutical outcome validation by mining clinical trial repositories to confirm whether any Phase III studies reported drug efficacy above 90% in sample sizes over 1,000 before 2010, and identifying the lead clinical research scientist.
- Corporate financial compliance audit by scanning a company‚Äôs SEC filings (10-K/8-K) for mentions of restated net income exceeding $50 million, extracting the fiscal year and CFO responsible at the time.
- Legal e-discovery and contract review by processing a repository of corporate agreements to locate termination clauses requiring notice periods longer than six months, isolating clause text and listing contract managers for each contract.
- Academic systematic review for meta-analysis by aggregating published journal abstracts to find studies reporting statistically significant results (p < 0.001) in cohorts over 1,000 subjects published before 2015, summarizing primary authors and journal names.
- Consumer electronics quality assurance by analyzing internal test reports to identify device models that failed more than five consecutive drop tests, cataloging failure reasons and the responsible test engineer.
- Environmental sustainability benchmarking by scanning corporate CSR reports to extract instances where organizations pledged carbon emission reductions above 30% by 2025, and identifying the sustainability officer for follow-up.
- Cultural heritage archiving by searching museum and gallery exhibition records to confirm if an artist‚Äôs solo retrospectives attracted over 10,000 visitors before the year 2000, noting exhibition dates and curators.
