- Film studies thesis support by aggregating summaries of Valentina Re’s chapter on metalepsis from Google Books and publisher sites to populate a literature review database
- University library metadata update by scheduling the script to validate and enrich catalog records for "World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries" with accurate ISBN, publisher description, and chapter information
- Academic publisher metadata validation by cross-referencing Google Books API data against the Amsterdam University Press website to ensure accuracy before printing new editions
- Digital course content curation by integrating the solution into an LMS to automatically import key theoretical frameworks and chapter outlines into film theory and transmedia storytelling syllabi
- Academic marketing automation by extracting thematic highlights on horror cinema and dream world representations to generate targeted social media posts and email campaigns promoting the book
- Digital humanities corpus building by scraping multiple edited collections for chapter-level metadata and thematic mentions to create a searchable narrative analysis dataset
- Bibliographic network analysis by converting the JSON outputs into graph visualizations mapping relationships between concepts like metalepsis, genre studies, and diegetic levels across academic publications
- Conference program generation by scraping speaker bios and chapter abstracts to automatically produce session descriptions and booklets for a film theory workshop on world building
