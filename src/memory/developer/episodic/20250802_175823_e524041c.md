### Development Step 10: Locate and Transcribe Teal'c’s Reply to “Isn’t That Hot?” in YouTube Video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Extracting and timestamping key customer feedback phrases (e.g., “This product saved me”) from recorded user testimonial videos to streamline marketing content creation
- Automatically identifying and isolating objection-handling responses (e.g., “Isn’t that expensive?”) in sales training recordings for targeted coaching improvements
- Scanning archived corporate town hall livestreams to locate and transcribe specific policy-related Q&A segments (e.g., “How will this impact our benefits?”) for HR documentation
- Monitoring compliance in financial webinars by detecting and extracting disclaimers (e.g., “Past performance does not guarantee future results”) to ensure regulatory adherence
- Harvesting precise technical definitions (e.g., “A tensor is…”) from recorded academic lectures to build a searchable glossary for e-learning platforms
- Analyzing product review unboxing videos to find and compile sensory reaction comments (e.g., “It feels so smooth”) for R&D insights on material performance
- Reviewing legal deposition videos to pinpoint and transcribe witness admissions of fact (e.g., “I saw him at 8 p.m.”) to accelerate case preparation
- Indexing cooking show episodes to extract chef remarks on safety (e.g., “Be careful—this oil is extremely hot”) for automated closed-caption warnings in streaming services
