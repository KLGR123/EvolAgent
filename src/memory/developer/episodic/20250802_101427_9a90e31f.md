### Development Step 20: Extract and alphabetically sort birth cities of presidents with min/max longitudes

**Description**: Identify the records in workspace/presidential_birthplaces.json with the minimum longitude and the maximum longitude, extract their birth_city values, sort those two city names alphabetically, and output them as a comma-separated list.

**Use Cases**:
- Political cartography and interactive map generation identifying the westernmost and easternmost presidential birth cities for a historical mapping web app
- Educational e-learning platform automation to generate trivia questions about the most geographically extreme U.S. presidents’ birth cities for civics courses
- Heritage tourism itinerary planning tool to automatically highlight the easternmost and westernmost presidential birthplaces for guided tours
- Political science research data preprocessing for spatial analysis of presidential origins to study regional trends in leadership backgrounds
- News media content automation for daily “Did you know?” facts, extracting extreme presidential birth cities to engage readers
- Museum exhibit interactive kiosk backend that loads the farthest presidential birth locations to display site-specific multimedia content
- GIS and location-based service integration to tag and annotate the extreme points of presidential birthplaces on a U.S. map dashboard
- Historical blog or newsletter generation pipeline that pulls in the most eastern and western presidential birth cities for curated geography-focused posts
