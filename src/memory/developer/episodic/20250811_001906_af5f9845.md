### Development Step 9: Title: Unscramble Anagram to Reveal Famous Hamlet Line Using All 100 Letters Exactly Once

**Description**: Solve the anagram by rearranging the letters from 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten' to find the original Shakespeare line from Hamlet that this phrase represents. Focus on identifying one of Shakespeare's most well-known lines from the tragedy, ensuring all 100 letters are used exactly once in the rearrangement.

**Use Cases**:
- University literature professor designing an automated quiz system that generates anagram puzzles from classic texts for student engagement and assessment
- Digital humanities researcher verifying the authenticity of historical Shakespeare quotations using letter frequency analysis and anagram solving
- Escape room game designer creating challenging literary puzzles that require participants to reconstruct famous lines from scrambled clues
- Educational technology developer building an interactive app where students solve anagrams to learn about Shakespearean language and context
- Publishing house editor checking for plagiarism or unauthorized text modifications in submitted manuscripts by comparing letter distributions of famous quotes
- AI-powered chatbot for museums or cultural institutions, providing visitors with interactive Shakespeare trivia based on anagram decoding
- Forensic linguist analyzing ransom notes or anonymous letters for hidden references to classic literature using strategic anagram matching
- Automated grading tool for creative writing assignments, validating that student-generated anagrams accurately reconstruct the original literary source
