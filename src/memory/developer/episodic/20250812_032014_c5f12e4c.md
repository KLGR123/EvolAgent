### Development Step 11: Sponsor of December 1897 $25 Pension Act Benefiting Auburn Methodist Church Founder

**Description**: Research the December 1897 legislation that granted $25 monthly soldier's pensions to identify who introduced the specific bill that benefited the Civil War veteran who established the Auburn Methodist Episcopal Church South Mission in 1903. Focus on Congressional records from December 1897, particularly the Disability Pension Act or related veteran pension legislation. Search for the bill's sponsor, co-sponsors, and legislative history to determine which member of Congress introduced this pension legislation that ultimately benefited the Auburn institution founder.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historical research into Civil War pension legislation sponsorship for university history departments
- Genealogical tracing of family ancestors’ military pension entitlements using automated scraping of Congressional records
- Legal consulting and brief preparation on veteran disability benefits for law firms specializing in veterans affairs
- Automated legislative tracking and database population for nonprofit veteran advocacy organizations
- Digital archiving and metadata enrichment of 19th-century pension legislation for library and archival special collections
- Civic tech dashboard creation monitoring congressional sponsorship patterns in historical sessions for transparency portals
- Digital humanities curriculum development teaching automated scraping and analysis of historical legislative documents
- Heritage preservation grant writing support by mapping the economic impact of historical veteran pensions on community institutions
