### Development Step 6: Identify the First Name in Holabird & Roche’s Official Firm Title as of June 2023

**Description**: Research the architectural firm Holabird & Roche to determine the first name appearing in the firm's name as of June 2023. Focus on finding: (1) The complete firm name and any variations or successors, (2) The chronological order of names in the firm title, (3) Verify the firm's status and naming convention as of June 2023, (4) Confirm which name appears first alphabetically or positionally in the official firm designation. Look for the firm's current website, professional directories, architectural databases, and recent project listings to establish the exact naming format used in 2023.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal due diligence for architecture M&A: automatically verifying the official corporate name and its historical variations to support merger documentation.
- Historical building preservation research: extracting firm name change timelines from online archives to annotate restoration project reports.
- Real estate developer accreditation: confirming the current licensed name of architectural partners for property development compliance filings.
- Marketing competitor brand mapping: collecting and analyzing architectural firm name transitions to update competitor profiles in strategic planning.
- SEO and brand consistency auditing: scanning websites, directories, and social media snippets to ensure the firm’s current name is displayed uniformly across digital channels.
- Academic scholarly work validation: verifying citation accuracy by extracting official firm names and their historical context for architecture research papers.
- Contract management automation: parsing supplier data to match architectural firm legal names for automated procurement and invoicing workflows.
- Knowledge base synchronization for CRMs: updating customer relationship management systems with the most recent official company names based on structured web search data.
