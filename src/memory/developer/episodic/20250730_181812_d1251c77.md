### Development Step 7: Search for Valentina Re’s Metalepsis, Horror, and Dream Worlds in World Building (2017)

**Description**: Conduct a web search for the book "World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries" (2017) edited by Marta Boni, focusing on Valentina Re's chapter or contribution. Look specifically for information about metalepsis, horror movies, dream worlds and reality in Valentina Re's work.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic librarians automate the ingestion of detailed book and chapter metadata (ISBN, chapter titles, author bios) into their catalogs for new transmedia studies acquisitions.
- Film studies professors extract concise summaries of concepts like metalepsis, horror, and dream worlds to rapidly build lecture slides and reading guides for narrative theory courses.
- Digital humanities researchers compile a searchable database of thematic mentions across multiple scholarly volumes—such as uncanny effects and diegetic boundaries—to support cross-textual analysis.
- Transmedia storytelling consultants use structured insights from Valentina Re’s chapter on narrative levels and metalepsis to advise studios on designing immersive horror-dream world experiences.
- Academic journal editors run automated checks against publisher and Google Books data to verify and enrich bibliographic entries on media theory submissions, ensuring accurate citations.
- AI/ML engineers generate labeled training sets of narrative technique descriptions (e.g., metalepsis, uncanny, diegetic transgressions) extracted from scholarly texts for genre-classification models.
- Publishing market analysts scrape publisher catalogs, Google Books, and Google Scholar to monitor metadata trends and academic interest in transmedia studies titles, guiding acquisition strategies.
