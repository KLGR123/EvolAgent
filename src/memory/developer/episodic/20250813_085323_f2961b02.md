### Development Step 2: Identify Illustrator and Writer Collaborations for the ‘Little Monsters’ Comic

**Description**: Search for information about the comic book 'Little Monsters' to identify its illustrator/artist. Focus on finding the artist who illustrated this comic and any information about their collaborations with writers. Look for official publication details, creator credits, and any collaborative relationships mentioned in connection with this work.

**Use Cases**:
- Comic publisher royalty audit and artist credit verification by automatically extracting illustrator names and publication details from multiple online sources to ensure accurate royalty distribution
- Digital comic library metadata enrichment and cataloging by scraping creator credits and collaboration info to enable advanced search and filtering for subscribers
- Intellectual property litigation support by gathering documented evidence of artist–writer collaborations and official publication records for legal cases involving copyright disputes
- Academic network analysis of graphic novel collaborations by harvesting illustrator and writer pairings from publisher databases and web sources for social graph studies
- Comic arts journalism research by collecting and consolidating illustrator biographies and past project credits to craft in-depth profile articles on emerging artists
- SEO-driven content strategy for a comics e-commerce site by extracting top comic artist names and associated titles to optimize landing pages and improve search rankings
- Convention programming and guest curation by compiling a database of ‘Little Monsters’ artists and their collaboration histories to plan panels and artist signings
- Online marketplace product listing automation by scraping and auto-populating artist and publication metadata for comic book items to streamline seller workflows
