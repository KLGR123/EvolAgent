### Development Step 9: Identify 1983 East German Malko Competition Winner’s First Name

**Description**: Analyze the extracted Malko Competition data from workspace files to identify the specific winner from East Germany and extract their first name. Focus on the 1983 winner Claus Peter who was identified as being from East Germany (a country that no longer exists). Verify this is the only recipient from the specified time period whose nationality corresponds to a defunct country, and extract the first name 'Claus' as the answer to the task.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical sports archiving and metadata verification: automatically confirm JSON exports include the correct winners’ personal details and countries for archival of defunct nations in sports databases
- Award nomination quality assurance in publishing: validate JSON files containing literature prize recipients to ensure first names, full names, years, and former countries are accurately extracted before public release
- Data engineering pipeline validation for music competitions: run automated checks on JSON outputs to confirm the correct extraction of awardee fields (first_name, winner_full_name, year, country) in ETL workflows
- Scientific publication affiliation auditing: extract and verify author first names and historical institution countries (including ones that no longer exist) from JSON metadata to maintain accurate research records
- Legal case decision indexing and verification: ensure JSON summaries of court rulings properly capture litigant first names and dissolved jurisdiction names for compliance with archival regulations
- Business intelligence report validation: automatically inspect exported JSON KPI files to verify sales manager first names, regions (even reorganized territories), and reporting years before updating executive dashboards
- HR candidate data consistency checks: validate JSON resumes to confirm extracted candidate first names, full names, application years, and former company names (including defunct subsidiaries) meet recruitment data standards
- Museum collection catalog QA: run scripted verification on JSON artifact records to confirm artist first names, artifact acquisition years, and origin countries (including historical states) are correctly recorded before publication
