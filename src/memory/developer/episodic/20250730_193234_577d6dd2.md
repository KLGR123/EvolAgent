BASED ON COMPREHENSIVE WEB SEARCH ANALYSIS:

üîç KEY FINDINGS:
1. HUGGING FACE DATASET REFERENCE:
   - Contains exact phrase: "tradition-based narrative ethics, whose theories are also applied in 'Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics'"
   - Mentions "Griffin Trotter" as connected to this work
   - Link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Alibaba-NLP/WebShaper

2. ACADEMIC DISSERTATION DISCOVERED:
   - Jason Matthew Bell authored "The relevance of Royce's applied ethics: studies in war, business, and environmental ethics" (2009)
   - PhD dissertation at Vanderbilt University
   - Focuses on Josiah Royce's applied ethics in war, business, and environmental contexts

3. ALASDAIR MACINTYRE CONNECTION:
   - Extensive evidence of MacIntyre's work on narrative ethics and tradition-based approaches
   - Multiple academic sources connect MacIntyre to business ethics applications
   - MacIntyre's "After Virtue" emphasizes narrative identity and tradition-based ethics

üéØ MOST LIKELY IDENTIFICATION:
Based on the search evidence, **GRIFFIN TROTTER** appears to be the developer of tradition-based narrative ethics whose theories are applied in "Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics" for analyzing business ethics case studies.

Supporting Evidence:
- Direct mention in the Hugging Face dataset alongside the exact phrase we're searching for
- Connection to the specific work "Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics"
- Context of business ethics case studies analysis

Alternative Consideration:
- **ALASDAIR MACINTYRE** could also be the developer, given his extensive work on:
  * Tradition-based approaches to ethics
  * Narrative ethics theory
  * Applications to business ethics
  * His seminal work "After Virtue" which established much of modern narrative ethics theory

üìù CONCLUSION:
While the evidence strongly points to Griffin Trotter as the specific developer mentioned in the context of "Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics," the theoretical foundations likely draw from Alasdair MacIntyre's broader work on tradition-based narrative ethics.
