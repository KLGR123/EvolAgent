### Development Step 13: Abel Hugo’s Napoleonic Service, Madrid Residency, Map Publications, Hospital de Saint Louis & Reign Context

**Description**: Research Abel Hugo, Victor Hugo's brother, focusing on his military service during the Napoleonic Wars and his time in Madrid. Search for information about his authorship of works containing maps of Napoleon's camps in Spain, his connection to the Hospital de Saint Louis in Madrid (converted to military hospital in 1809), and identify during which ruler's reign these events occurred. Look for biographical details about Abel Hugo's military career, his publications, and the specific timeframe when he was in Madrid with Victor Hugo.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historian consolidating manuscript transcriptions, library JSON catalogs, and digital secondary sources to produce an authoritative multi-section article on Abel Hugo’s Napoleonic service for a peer-reviewed journal
- Museum exhibition team automating the ingestion and geospatial tagging of period camp maps, military dispatches, and Hospital de Saint Louis records to build an interactive Madrid-campaign timeline for visitors
- Genealogy research firm merging civil registry JSON exports, family correspondence archives, and military muster rolls to generate a detailed Hugo family lineage report for clients tracing aristocratic ancestors
- Publishing house fact-checking department using automated deduplication and relevance scoring to cross-verify biographical claims and publication dates in a forthcoming Victor Hugo sibling biography before print
- University digital humanities lab extracting keywords, relevance scores, and timeframe contexts from heterogeneous JSON archives to power an analytic dashboard tracking authorship and military themes in 19th-century works
- Defense wargaming team consolidating open-source battlefield maps, after-action reports, and campaign narratives to automate creation of simulation-ready data layers reflecting Napoleonic troop movements in Spain
- EdTech company building interactive learning modules by synthesizing Wikipedia entries, Google Books previews, and archival correspondence into concise biographical flashcards on key military historians
- Policy analysis consultancy automating synthesis of legislative archives, public speeches, and media reports to map a lawmaker’s career events onto a timeline under successive administrations
