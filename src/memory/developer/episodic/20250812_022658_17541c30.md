### Development Step 6: Identify Production Company Behind ‘Becky Sharp’ (1935), First Full-Length Three-Strip Technicolor Film

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the first full-length color film using three-strip Technicolor titled 'Becky Sharp' and determine which company produced it. Search for keywords including 'Becky Sharp 1935 three-strip Technicolor producer', 'first full-length Technicolor film production company', 'Becky Sharp movie producer studio', and 'three-strip Technicolor Becky Sharp who produced'. Focus on identifying the specific production company or studio that created this pioneering color film to establish which company employed the composer we need to identify.

**Use Cases**:
- Film archival metadata automation and production credit verification for digital cinema libraries
- Historical research and fact-checking of early color film production details for academic publications
- Streaming platform metadata enrichment and credit attribution for content management teams
- Documentary pre-production research and primary source aggregation for film historians
- Legal due diligence and patent origin investigation for entertainment law practices
- Marketing competitive analysis and studio affiliation mapping for film distribution strategists
- Educational curriculum development and case study compilation for cinema studies instructors
- Automated credibility auditing and source validation for journalism fact-checkers
