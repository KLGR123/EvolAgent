### Development Step 23: Identify ‘Little Monsters’ Comic Illustrator and Their Writer Collaborations

**Description**: Search for information about the comic book 'Little Monsters' to identify its illustrator/artist. Focus on finding the artist who illustrated this comic and any information about their collaborations with writers. Look for official publication details, creator credits, and any collaborative relationships mentioned in connection with this work.

**Use Cases**:
- Comic publisher’s metadata quality control by verifying illustrator credits across JSON archives of backlisted titles
- Public library catalog enhancement by extracting comic artist information from saved HTML retailer pages to update bibliographic records
- Legal IP due diligence by aggregating creator credits from internal JSON files and external HTML sources before licensing agreements
- Marketing team trend analysis by mining ‘Little Monsters’ mentions in retailer HTML dumps to spotlight emerging illustrators for promotional campaigns
- Academic research on collaboration networks by scanning JSON search results for artist–writer partnerships in the indie comic scene
- E-commerce site enrichment by automating artist credit extraction from comic shop HTML pages to populate product listings accurately
- Fan community wiki curation by consolidating illustrator details and publication histories from local HTML/JSON archives
- DevOps automated reporting on missing or inconsistent artist fields in comic metadata JSON to uphold data governance standards
