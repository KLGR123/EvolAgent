### Development Step 2: Determine Colors of Missing Edge Piece on Rubikâ€™s Cube from Found-Cube Constraints

**Description**: Analyze the Rubik's cube structure and systematically determine which cubes have been found based on the given constraints. Start by establishing the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cube composition: 6 center cubes (one colored face each), 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each), and 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each). Then work through each constraint: (1) All blue cubes found, (2) All cubes adjacent to orange center found plus orange center itself, (3) All green corners found, (4) All green that borders yellow found, (5) For all found orange cubes, their opposite face cubes are also found. Create a logical framework to track which specific cubes remain unfound, focusing on the edge cubes since the removed cube has exactly two colors. Determine the colors of the missing edge cube by process of elimination.

**Use Cases**:
- Automotive assembly line component verification by applying adjacency and part-opposite constraints to identify missing engine subcomponents in production
- Telecom network topology validation using JSON-based node and link constraints to pinpoint unconfigured or missing network connections
- Medical imaging segmentation QA by enforcing tissue-adjacency rules on 3D MRI model data to detect unlabeled or missing regions
- Retail warehouse inventory audit through structured SKU-location constraints and opposite-zone checks to uncover misplaced or missing stock items
- Microservices deployment health check by analyzing service-configuration JSON, dependency adjacency, and replica-opposite rules to find missing instances
- Financial ledger reconciliation using transaction adjacency and double-entry constraints to detect missing journal entries in accounting systems
- University course scheduling audit with prerequisite-adjacency and corequisite-opposite constraints to identify unscheduled required courses
- Robotic assembly validation by applying 3D part-adjacency and opposite-face constraints on CAD model exports to locate missing or misaligned panels
