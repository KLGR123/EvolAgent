### Development Step 31: Identify Australian captain in Arthur Morris‚Äôs pre-1973 Test 300+ innings

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated compliance audit of quarterly financial filings by parsing JSON disclosure documents, flagging missing sections and summarizing key ratios for the CFO‚Äôs review
- Clinical trial literature curation that ingests PubMed JSON abstracts, extracts patient cohort sizes, outcome measures, and principal investigators for systematic meta-analyses
- Customer support ticket triage and trend analysis by processing Zendesk API JSON exports, categorizing urgent issues, and generating weekly escalation reports for the operations team
- Patent prior-art discovery workflow that scans USPTO bulk JSON filings, identifies similar claims, extracts inventor names and filing dates, and compiles competitive intelligence dossiers for IP attorneys
- Social media crisis detection for brand protection by ingesting Twitter and Facebook JSON feeds, performing sentiment scoring, and alerting PR managers to spikes in negative mentions
- IoT fleet performance monitoring and anomaly detection through analysis of JSON-formatted device telemetry, triggering automated maintenance tickets when temperature or power usage exceeds thresholds
- E-commerce competitor pricing tracker that scrapes retailer API JSON responses, extracts product SKUs and price changes, and updates dynamic repricing rules for the merchandising team
- Academic citation network mapping by processing CrossRef JSON metadata, building co-authorship graphs and citation counts to inform grant committees and university research strategists
