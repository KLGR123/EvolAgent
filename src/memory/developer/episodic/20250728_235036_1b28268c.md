### Development Step 7: Extract “Claus”: 1983 East German Winner of the Malko Competition

**Description**: Analyze the extracted Malko Competition data from workspace files to identify the specific winner from East Germany and extract their first name. Focus on the 1983 winner Claus Peter who was identified as being from East Germany (a country that no longer exists). Verify this is the only recipient from the specified time period whose nationality corresponds to a defunct country, and extract the first name 'Claus' as the answer to the task.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical music competition archive validation and metadata extraction for cultural heritage institutions
- Genealogical data curation by extracting first names and national origin from family history JSONs for genealogy platforms
- Political science research on defunct states by parsing JSON award records to identify and analyze East German participants
- Corporate compliance audits by scanning JSON contracts and award databases to detect entities linked to defunct jurisdictions like the DDR for risk assessment
- Digital humanities project on Cold War era by automating extraction of personal names and countries from JSON award data to build interactive timelines
- E-learning content generation for history courses by programmatically retrieving notable East German laureates from JSON archives for educational modules
- Museum collection management automation by updating JSON metadata of award-winning artists with correct first names and tagging defunct countries
- Open data portal enhancement by validating and standardizing historical prize-winner JSON datasets to ensure entries from defunct states are properly flagged
