### Development Step 18: Search for French Pioneer Pictures composers of 1976 Montreal Olympics theme music

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements and search for alternative composers who both worked for Pioneer Pictures and composed theme music for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. The previous research focused on André Mathieu who was born in Canada, not France, which doesn't match the TASK criteria. Search for other composers associated with the 1976 Montreal Olympics who might have French origins and Pioneer Pictures connections, including any secondary composers, arrangers, or musicians involved in the Olympic ceremonies who had film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Music archivists performing provenance research to confirm which French-born composer associated with Pioneer Pictures created the 1976 Montreal Olympics theme for accurate library cataloging
- Film historians verifying composer credits and studio affiliations in digital movie databases to correct misattributed Pioneer Pictures soundtracks
- Cultural studies researchers analyzing the influence of French composers in major international events for an academic paper on transnational music heritage
- Documentary producers gathering verified biographical details on Olympic ceremony composers of French origin to ensure factual accuracy in a 1976 Montreal retrospective
- Legal teams conducting due diligence on composer nationality and film studio connections to secure proper rights for reissuing archival Olympic recordings
- Event programmers curating a concert series of historic Olympic music who need precise composer–studio links to draft program notes and secure performance permissions
- Metadata specialists automating enrichment of digital archives by extracting nationality, studio affiliation, and event involvement for each composer’s record
- Educational content developers building an interactive timeline of Olympic opening ceremonies, highlighting French-born composers with Pioneer Pictures backgrounds for an online history module
