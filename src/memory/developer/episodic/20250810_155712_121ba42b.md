### Development Step 15: Identify Surrey Lodge‚Äôs Developing Organization, Its Founder, and the Founder‚Äôs Birth Year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum curation automation: Extracting founder names and birth years from archival JSON and text files to enrich exhibition catalogs on Victorian fraternal societies
- Genealogical research workflows: Parsing family archive data and performing targeted web searches to confirm ancestor birth dates and organizational roles
- Academic history projects: Integrating disparate research results and online biographical sources to compile detailed profiles of 18th-century organization founders
- Cultural heritage management: Synthesizing local council research and web-based historical records to document building founders and secure preservation grants
- E-learning content generation: Auto-creating concise founder biographies and timelines from raw research documents for interactive history modules
- Publishing fact-checking pipelines: Validating historical details‚Äîsuch as founder identities and birth years‚Äîfor books on London‚Äôs Victorian era societies
- Legal due-diligence support: Combining JSON research data with targeted online searches to verify heritage property lineage and founder information in transaction reports
- Digital archive enhancement: Tagging metadata in historical building records with organization affiliations and founder birth years to improve searchability and access
