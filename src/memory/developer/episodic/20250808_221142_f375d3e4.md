### Development Step 15: Identify Mexico City firm owning Gran Hotel Ciudad de México, operating CINETOP, partnered with Telemundo.

**Description**: Search for information about the specific Mexico City-based company that simultaneously owns Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico, operates CINETOP cinema chain, and partnered with Telemundo in 2006 for their Mexico television expansion project. The previous research identified that Grupo Hunan owns the hotel but does not operate CINETOP or partner with Telemundo, indicating we need to find a different company that connects all three business activities mentioned in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate due diligence for M&A teams verifying target company’s hotel assets, cinema operations, and media partnerships before deal approval
- Investment research analysts automating evidence collection on potential portfolio companies’ diversified holdings and alliance history
- Market intelligence units tracking competitor expansions by confirming cinema chains, hotel ownership, and broadcast partnerships in Mexico City
- Financial auditors validating public disclosures on subsidiary operations and strategic partnerships for regulatory compliance reporting
- Business journalists fact-checking claims about a conglomerate’s assets and alliances (e.g., hotel ownership, film theaters, TV deals) before publishing investigative articles
- Legal counsel gathering documentary evidence of corporate relationships and asset control to support antitrust filings or contract negotiations
- Academic media researchers compiling structured datasets on Latin American media-hospitality conglomerates for conference papers and industry studies
