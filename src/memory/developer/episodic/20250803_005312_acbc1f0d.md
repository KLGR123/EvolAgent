### Development Step 14: Largest and Smallest Washington County Seats by Land Area and 2020 Census Populations

**Description**: Identify the largest and smallest county seats by land area from the complete dataset of 39 Washington state county seats with their land area measurements. Then extract the 2020 census population data for these two specific county seats using the official data.census.gov source as specified in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- GIS-based resource allocation dashboard for Washington State Department of Health to plan rural vaccination clinics by comparing land area and population density in sprawling county seats versus compact towns
- Public transportation route optimization for Sound Transit to ensure efficient bus coverage in the largest county seat (by land area) and the smallest one, using 2020 census population figures
- Cell tower placement strategy for a telecommunications provider to maximize signal coverage in low-density, large-area county seats and high-density, small-area counterparts
- Emergency services deployment plan for the Washington State Fire Marshal’s Office, balancing response times by analyzing both land area and resident counts of the biggest and smallest county seats
- Real estate market analysis for a commercial developer evaluating potential investment in under-populated, expansive county seats versus densely settled, small-area locations
- Environmental impact assessment by the Washington Department of Ecology modeling per-capita green space availability in large-area county seats compared to compact urban centers
- Academic research by the University of Washington’s Geography Department examining correlations between county seat land area and population distribution across Washington
- State budget allocation tool for the Washington Office of Financial Management to distribute funds per capita, integrating land area size with the latest census population data
