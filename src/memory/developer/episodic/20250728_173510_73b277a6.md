### Development Step 8: Locate BERT-Base Encoder Layer Count from Original Paper or Official Documentation

**Description**: Search for BERT base model architecture specifications to determine the number of encoder layers. Focus on finding the original BERT paper 'BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding' or official documentation that specifies the layer count for BERT-base model configuration.

**Use Cases**:
- pre-deployment verification of BERT-base in regulated finance environments to ensure 12 encoder layers compliance before loan risk NLP model integration
- automated audit of healthcare AI documentation by parsing analysis JSON files to confirm transformer architecture specifications for regulatory approval
- NLP curriculum generation in academic settings by extracting authoritative BERT-base layer counts to auto-populate lecture materials and coding assignments
- MLOps metadata enrichment in enterprise AI platforms by automatically updating model registry entries with verified encoder layer counts from analysis artifacts
- research reproducibility validation in academic labs by programmatically confirming that BERT-base configurations match the original 12-layer specification in the original paper
- compliance reporting for corporate AI governance by generating evidence-based reports on transformer model architectures using layer-count extraction from analysis data
- competitive intelligence for NLP startups by verifying competitor claims about model sizes through programmatic extraction of public BERT-base layer specifications
- continuous integration checks for cloud NLP services by integrating a layer-count extraction step into CI pipelines to ensure deployed BERT endpoints use the correct base configuration
