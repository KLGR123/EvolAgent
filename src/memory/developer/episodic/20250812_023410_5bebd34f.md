### Development Step 27: French-Born Early Hollywood Film Composers of 1976 Montreal Olympics Themes

**Description**: Search for composers who worked on the 1976 Montreal Olympics theme music with a focus on identifying any who were born in France and had connections to early Hollywood film studios, particularly those involved in Technicolor productions. Expand the search beyond Pioneer Pictures to include other studios from the 1930s-1940s era that may have employed French-born composers. Look for Olympic fanfares, ceremonial music, or broadcast themes from the 1976 Montreal Games that were composed by French musicians with film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Olympic broadcast music metadata enrichment and composer provenance tracking for a national sports network’s media asset management system
- Film studio archival research automation to identify French-born composers from the 1930s–1940s and tag their Technicolor-era credits
- Music licensing and rights clearance workflow for a publishing house, automatically flagging composers’ nationalities and studio affiliations
- Academic musicology corpus analysis to systematically catalogue cross‐references between Olympic fanfares and early Hollywood scores
- Cultural heritage digital library curation that annotates Olympic ceremony recordings with composer biographies and era-specific studio connections
- Sports event planning tool that analyzes historical Olympics themes to recommend composer profiles fitting specific broadcast branding requirements
- Automated media‐asset metadata enrichment in a documentary‐production pipeline, extracting composer names, birthplaces, and studio credits from legacy search results
