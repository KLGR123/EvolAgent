### Development Step 2: Research Neil Gorsuch’s 54-45 nuclear‐option confirmation and identify the serving U.S. Attorney General

**Description**: Research the Supreme Court nominee who replaced Antonin Scalia and identify which confirmation was the first after the cloture rule change via nuclear option for Supreme Court nominees, resulting in a 54-45 Senate vote. Then determine who served as U.S. Attorney General during this confirmation process.

**Use Cases**:
- Supreme Court confirmation tracking and automated briefing generation for a law firm’s legislative affairs team
- Political science research and timeline compilation for an academic department studying judicial appointments
- Government relations department workflow automation for creating stakeholder memos on federal nominations
- Newsroom data journalism pipeline for producing interactive online timelines of Supreme Court votes
- Legal technology archival system for updating and maintaining historical records of confirmation processes
- Nonprofit watchdog reporting on Senate voting patterns and Attorney General timelines for transparency initiatives
- Corporate compliance dashboard integration to monitor changes in federal judicial leadership and policy impacts
- Educational platform content generation for a civics course, including JSON feeds and summary texts on landmark confirmations
