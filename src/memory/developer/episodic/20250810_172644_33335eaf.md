### Development Step 4: Indiana’s First Governor’s Namesake 23.6-Mile I-65 Section: Resolution Date and County

**Description**: Research Indiana's first governor to identify who this person was, then search for information about a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 that was named in their honor. Focus on finding when the Indiana legislative body passed the resolution to designate this highway section. Additionally, identify which Indiana county was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 to determine the specific location of this Interstate 65 section.

**Use Cases**:
- Transportation GIS asset management and memorial highway resolution indexing for state Departments of Transportation
- Legislative archival workflow automation and metadata extraction for public records in state archives
- Historical tourism app content curation and timeline generation linking colonial counties to modern infrastructures
- Government affairs monitoring and analysis of highway naming resolutions for lobbying firms and policy consultants
- Educational module development and interactive timeline creation for university state history courses
- Map publisher compliance verification and design validation of memorial highway naming based on legislative statutes
- Civic tech transparency dashboard creation for citizens to explore transportation asset naming and resolution data
- Academic geospatial research and demographic analysis correlating 18th-century county boundaries with present-day highway routes
