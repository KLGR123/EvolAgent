### Development Step 2: Locate “Isn’t That Hot?” Dialogue in YouTube Video and Document Teal’c’s Exact Response

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate eLearning team retrieving and timestamping critical Q&A segments from training videos for onboarding documentation
- Legal eDiscovery specialists scanning and transcribing targeted dialogue from publicly posted deposition videos for case evidence preparation
- Marketing analysts monitoring influencer product reviews on YouTube, extracting and cataloging instances of brand mentions for sentiment tracking
- Academic linguistics researchers locating and transcribing specific phonetic phenomena in lecture videos to support corpus-based language studies
- Compliance officers identifying segments in financial webinars where regulatory requirements are discussed, to ensure accurate policy implementation
- Podcast producers automating extraction of sponsor-read ad segments from long-form video content to streamline editing and QC processes
- Accessibility coordinators generating precise transcripts of key interactions in educational videos to improve captioning accuracy for hearing-impaired students
