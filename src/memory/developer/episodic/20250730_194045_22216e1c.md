### Development Step 2: Identify Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern Gang and Their Major 1924 Indiana Heist and 1934 Black Hudson Robbery

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang and their criminal activities, focusing on their first major heist in Indiana in 1924 and the 1934 bank robbery that was John Dillinger's last robbery involving a black Hudson getaway car. Search for keywords including 'Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang', 'John Dillinger 1934 last robbery black Hudson', 'Indiana bank robbery 1924', 'Harry Pierpont gang', and 'Dillinger gang bank robberies'. Extract information about gang members, their criminal activities, and any testimony that led to convictions of gang leaders.

**Use Cases**:
- Law enforcement cold-case investigations: Automate archival web searches to uncover overlooked testimonies and newspaper reports on the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gangâ€™s 1924 Indiana heist for potential case re-evaluation.
- Museum exhibit curation: Compile period-accurate titles, snippets, and timelines about John Dillingerâ€™s 1934 black Hudson getaway car robbery to design curated panels and interactive displays on Prohibition-era crime.
- Documentary film research: Rapidly extract organic search results, links, and contextual snippets around Harry Pierpontâ€™s first major heist in Indiana and Dillingerâ€™s last bank job for accurate on-screen narration and archival footage sourcing.
- Academic criminology thesis support: Systematically gather and categorize primary source links, gang member details, and court-testimony evidence to analyze organized crime evolution for a graduate dissertation.
- Genealogical investigation service: Validate ancestral claims by cross-referencing family lore of involvement in 1924 bank robberies with online newspaper archives and conviction records retrieved through focused queries.
- Legal due-diligence for heritage property developers: Investigate historical criminal events tied to Indiana landmarks by extracting documented heist details and trial outcomes to inform restoration impact reports.
- Interactive crime-map application: Integrate geotagged data from search results on 1924 and 1934 robberies to build a public-facing web tool visualizing key gang activity locations and dates across Midwestern towns.
