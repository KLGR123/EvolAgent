### Development Step 25: Arthur Morris 300+ Test innings: match captain identification before 1973-74

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Cricket archive verification and captain identification for sports historians analyzing historical Test match performances
- Automated fact-checking of player achievements in digital newsrooms to validate claims like ‚Äú300+ runs in an innings‚Äù
- Academic research audit of JSON-formatted search results for extracting and summarizing cricket career highlights in journal articles
- Business data quality checks in sports analytics pipelines to detect anomalies (e.g., missing captain info or improbable score entries)
- SEO performance auditing of cricket content by analyzing search logs JSON for query success rates and relevance improvements
- Compliance reporting automation for sports governing bodies, parsing match metadata to ensure accurate leadership and scoring details
- ETL pipeline validation in sports data warehouses, flagging inconsistent or erroneous JSON fields before BI dashboard updates
- Custom anomaly alert system for editorial teams to detect and review unusual statistical claims (like individual 300+ runs) in real time
