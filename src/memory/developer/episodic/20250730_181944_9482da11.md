### Development Step 11: Identify the horror film popularizing dream–reality metalepsis in Valentina Re’s World Building chapter

**Description**: Search for specific information about Valentina Re's chapter in the 2017 book "World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries" focusing on the horror movie that popularized metalepsis between dream world and reality. Look for academic sources, book previews, reviews, or scholarly articles that discuss this specific chapter and its content about metalepsis in horror films.

**Use Cases**:
- Graduate film studies researcher automates a literature review on metalepsis in horror cinema, gathering chapter metadata and summaries from Google Books, Crossref, and WorldCat to identify key texts for a dissertation.
- University library cataloging team enriches metadata for the “World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries” collection by programmatically pulling bibliographic records, contributor lists, and preview links across multiple APIs.
- Academic publisher’s editorial staff automates extraction of chapter summaries, key concepts, and relevance scores to produce marketing materials and blurbs for new Bloomsbury titles.
- Digital humanities project maps the diffusion of narrative boundary transgression concepts by mining academic sources and filtering film studies chapters on dream-reality metalepsis for interactive visualizations.
- Film festival programming committee curates panels on horror storytelling innovations by scraping and aggregating scholarly articles and book previews on Wes Craven’s A Nightmare on Elm Street to inform guest speaker lineups.
- Streaming service marketing team collects academic and fan reviews of landmark horror films, extracting themes and narrative analyses to tailor targeted advertising campaigns around metalepsis in storytelling.
- AI-driven academic recommendation engine integrates extracted metadata, chapter summaries, and relevance scores on transmedia world building to suggest related readings for university syllabi.
- Museum exhibition designer automates the collection of scholarly commentary on narrative techniques to build interactive kiosks explaining metalepsis and boundary blurring in horror media installations.

## Analysis of Metalepsis in "A Nightmare on Elm Street"

In Valentina Re's chapter, she explores how {horror_movie['title']} created a landmark example of metalepsis by blurring the boundaries between dream world and reality. In the film, the villain Freddy Krueger can attack people in their dreams, and injuries sustained in the dream world manifest physically in reality.

This transgression of boundaries between fictional dream space and diegetic reality created a new paradigm for horror storytelling that has influenced many subsequent films in the genre. The metaleptic device creates horror through the violation of expected ontological boundaries - what happens in dreams should not affect physical reality, but in Craven's film, these levels become permeable, creating both narrative complexity and genuine terror.
