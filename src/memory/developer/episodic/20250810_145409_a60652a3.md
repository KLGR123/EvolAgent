### Development Step 8: Identify Australia captain with first-ever 300+ Test innings vs New Zealand pre-1973/74

**Description**: Search for information about Test matches between Australia and New Zealand before the 1973-74 season where a player scored over 300 runs in an innings for the first time in Test cricket history. Focus on identifying which Australian cricketer captained Australia in that specific match and held the record for the highest individual innings score. Search for keywords including 'first Test cricket 300 runs innings', 'Australia New Zealand Test before 1973-74', 'Arthur Morris 300 runs Test match', 'highest individual Test innings Australia captain', and 'Test cricket scoring records pre-1974'.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal e-discovery document search and evidence extraction for litigation case preparation
- Medical literature screening and key findings tally for systematic reviews in healthcare research
- Cybersecurity vulnerability scan analysis and high-risk flag summarization for incident response teams
- Financial transaction audit and compliance report generation by parsing flagged search logs for regulatory reviews
- E-commerce order fulfillment monitoring and automated shipment exception reporting from warehouse search data
- Academic citation trend analysis and keyword frequency reporting for grant proposal development
- IT operations log surveillance and root-cause identification by extracting error patterns from search result JSONs
- Marketing campaign performance evaluation and sentiment-based insight generation from social media keyword searches
