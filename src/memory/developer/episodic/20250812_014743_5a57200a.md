### Development Step 1: Discover IFP-Reform Party Federalism and Bill of Rights Agreement and Identify SA Ambassador to France

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the agreement between a South African political figure and the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party that led to the formation of the Reform Party and proposed a federal system and bill of rights. Focus on finding information about this specific political agreement, the parties involved, and identify who later served as South African ambassador to France. Search for keywords including 'Inkatha Freedom Party agreement Reform Party', 'South Africa federal system bill of rights agreement', 'South African ambassador France Reform Party', and 'IFP leader political agreement federal system'.

**Use Cases**:
- University political science departments automating web searches and keyword extraction to build a detailed timeline of South African constitutional negotiations for graduate theses
- Law firms continuously monitoring government and party websites for new federal system proposals and bill of rights updates to advise corporate clients on compliance risks
- Foreign affairs ministries programmatically collecting ambassador appointment data from global sources to maintain an up-to-date diplomatic directory
- Newsrooms employing automated scraping of Wikipedia and official statements to fact-check reporting on political agreements and transitional negotiations
- Human rights NGOs aggregating and analyzing online references to bill of rights discussions and party charters to inform advocacy strategies and campaign materials
- Corporate government relations teams scanning international policy agreements and treaties for changes that could affect cross-border investments and regulatory planning
- Digital archivists creating searchable databases by extracting and annotating sections of historical political documents related to constitutional reforms from web archives
- Policy think tanks leveraging automated content analysis to compare federalism proposals across different democracies and identify best practices for legislative reports
