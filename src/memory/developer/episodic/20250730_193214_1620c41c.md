### Development Step 2: Identify Developer of Tradition-Based Narrative Ethics in ‚ÄúStudies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics‚Äù

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the developer of tradition-based narrative ethics whose theories are applied in 'Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics' which analyzes business ethics case studies. Search for keywords including 'tradition-based narrative ethics', 'Studies in War Business Environmental Ethics', 'narrative ethics theory', and 'business ethics case studies'. Focus on identifying the primary philosopher or ethicist who developed this theoretical framework and is referenced in academic literature on business ethics.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated curriculum enhancement for a university business ethics program by extracting and verifying the primary theorist behind ‚Äútradition-based narrative ethics‚Äù to ensure reading lists accurately reflect Alasdair MacIntyre‚Äôs work.
- Digital humanities research pipeline that crawls academic databases and JSON search result dumps to map narrative ethics references to their originating philosophers for publication trend analysis.
- Corporate compliance training content builder that auto-identifies foundational narrative ethics texts and their authors to source ethically grounded case studies for employee workshops.
- Library catalog metadata enrichment tool that programmatically searches publisher sites and Google results to confirm and append the correct author and theoretical framework tags to ethics textbooks.
- Knowledge graph population workflow in an AI-driven ethics advisory platform, linking ‚ÄúStudies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics‚Äù entries to Alasdair MacIntyre‚Äôs author profile for accurate recommendation outputs.
- Research assistant automation script for philosophy professors that runs targeted SERPAPI queries to compile up-to-date author information and publication details for semester-end bibliographies.
- Academic publishing quality control module that scans submitted manuscripts‚Äô reference lists and cross-checks via web searches to validate the attributed originator of tradition-based narrative ethics.
- EdTech content curation service that ingests JSON search results to auto-generate instructor-ready summaries of narrative ethics theorists and their key works for online course modules.
