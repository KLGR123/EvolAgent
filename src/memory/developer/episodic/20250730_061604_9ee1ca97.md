### Development Step 1: Seahorse Island Accommodation Types and Average Ratings Analysis

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/67e8878b-5cef-4375-804e-e6291fdbe78a.pdf to extract information about all accommodations in Seahorse Island. Identify the different types of accommodations (such as hotels, motels, rental houses, campgrounds, etc.) and their corresponding ratings. Calculate the average rating for each accommodation type to determine which type has the highest average rating.

**Use Cases**:
- Hotel chain competitor benchmarking using extracted Seahorse Island accommodation ratings to identify service gaps and improve guest satisfaction
- Tourism board destination quality assessment by aggregating PDF data on hotels, motels, and campgrounds to guide marketing campaigns
- Real estate investment analysis for short-term rental houses on Seahorse Island by computing average ratings to forecast ROI
- Park services maintenance planning through campground rating extraction from conservation reports to prioritize facility upgrades
- Travel agency itinerary optimization by parsing PDF accommodation listings and ratings to recommend top-rated stays
- Hospitality compliance monitoring by automated PDF auditing of inn and lodge service scores to enforce brand standards
- Academic tourism research on lodging preferences using structured PDF data to correlate accommodation types with visitor satisfaction
- Vacation rental platform enrichment by ingesting PDF-based accommodation details and ratings to enhance user recommendation algorithms
