### Development Step 12: Find Thorsten Schuette‚Äôs July 1965 Event Participation and Host City

**Description**: Search for information about director Thorsten Schuette's activities in July 1965, focusing on identifying what event he participated in and the city where it took place. Use search approaches including: (1) 'Thorsten Schuette July 1965 event', (2) 'Thorsten Schuette director biography 1965', (3) 'Thorsten Schuette filmmaker early career July 1965', and (4) Cross-reference with film festivals, cultural events, or significant happenings from July 1965 that might have involved this documentary director. Extract details about the specific event and its location to identify the city name.

**Use Cases**:

- Genealogist building a pipeline to validate a potentially misattributed birth year by correlating festival participation records from July 1965
- Streaming service content curator identifying mid-1960s festival entries to source and license vintage documentaries for targeted regional programming
- Cultural heritage NGO mapping post-war European film exchange networks by analyzing July 1965 festival events in Berlin, Moscow and Leipzig
