### Development Step 3: Identify 2022 Legume Wikipedia content violations and the meaning of “R” in core policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate compliance auditing for an internal knowledge base: automatically parse HTML edit histories to identify content removals before December 2022, map them against three core documentation policies, and report what “R” stands for in each policy.
- Academic media studies research on Wikipedia edit behavior: extract 2022 pre-December policy violations and analyze how often core policies (including the “R” for Reliability) are cited in public logs.
- Newsroom fact-checking workflow: monitor high-traffic Wikipedia pages’ edit history HTML to flag potential vandalism or copyright removals in 2022 and correlate them with the three core policies’ “R” references.
- Open-source project documentation QA: scan project wiki talk pages’ HTML to detect spam, deletion requests, or policy breaches before December 2022 and verify adherence to the trio of core guidelines, especially the “R” criterion.
- Legal discovery and e-discovery support: process archived HTML logs from Wikipedia to extract instances of content disputes in 2022, identify the violated policy types, and determine the meaning of “R” in each policy context.
- Government transparency dashboard: analyze municipal information pages’ edit histories to track policy enforcement actions taken before December 2022 and highlight the role of “R” (Reliability) in official content standards.
- Nonprofit misinformation monitoring: parse HTML of selected topic pages’ talk and history files to uncover 2022 content violations, categorize them under the three core policies, and detail how “R” shapes the reliable sourcing rule.
- Enterprise knowledge management automation: integrate a parser for wiki-style HTML logs to continuously detect policy violations (including “R”-related reliability issues) in user-generated content during 2022’s first eleven months.
