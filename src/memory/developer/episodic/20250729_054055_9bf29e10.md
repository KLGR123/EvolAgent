### Development Step 1: Extracting a Hidden Sentence from a 5Ã—7 Letter Grid

**Description**: Analyze the 5x7 block of text by reading all letters from left to right, row by row, to extract a meaningful sentence. Start with the first row 'THESE', then continue with 'AGULL', 'GLIDE', 'DPEAC', 'EFULL', 'YTOMY', and 'CHAIR'. Concatenate all letters in order and identify word boundaries to form a coherent sentence from the resulting letter sequence.

**Use Cases**:
- Archaeological inscription grid decoding for reconstructing fragmented ancient texts in museum research
- Digital forensics transposition cipher analysis for law enforcement investigators extracting hidden messages from intercepted communications
- Marketing promotion puzzle automation for generating and verifying hidden message word grids in brand engagement campaigns
- Word-search puzzle solver integration for mobile gaming apps to automatically identify user answers in custom letter grids
- Educational language-learning tool for teachers to create grid-based sentence puzzles that reinforce vocabulary and grammar
- Assistive technology for visually impaired users converting scanned letter grids from textbooks into coherent sentences via OCR and boundary detection
- Quality control in PCB manufacturing, decoding alphanumeric grid labels printed on circuit boards to verify part placement
- Academic computational linguistics research for analyzing and reconstructing text sequences from grid-based cipher schemes
