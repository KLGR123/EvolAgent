### Development Step 1: 20th Century Post-1977 Malko Competition Winners with Nationalities: Comprehensive Data Compilation

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic musicology research on post-1977 Malko Competition winners to analyze Cold War era nationality trends among laureates from former Soviet and Eastern Bloc states
- Digital library and archive curation workflows automating extraction and integration of Malko Competition winner metadata (names, years, defunct-country nationalities) into institutional catalogs
- Cultural policy assessment by government arts councils using historical winner data to evaluate the evolution of artistic support for musicians from now-dissolved states like Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia
- Museum and exhibition planning teams sourcing chronological recipient lists to create interactive displays on classical music heritage and geopolitical change from 1978 to 2000
- Music journalism and editorial projects compiling comprehensive timelines of Malko laureates for feature articles, anniversary retrospectives, and documentary scripts
- Library management system enhancements leveraging automated scraping routines to maintain up-to-date competition records and link laureate profiles across successor states of the former USSR
- Data journalism investigations visualizing shifts in international competition representation by mapping winner nationalities against historical state boundaries
- Grant evaluation committees benchmarking past competition winners’ trajectories by nationality to design equitable selection criteria for emerging classical musicians
