### Development Step 54: Extract tertiary education completion data by gender from Bulgarian 2011 Census PDF

**Description**: Extract the specific tertiary education completion data by gender from the downloaded Census2011final_en.pdf file in the workspace. Parse the document to locate the section containing tertiary education graduates by educational-qualification degree and sex, then extract the exact numbers of men and women who completed tertiary education according to the 2011 Bulgarian census.

**Use Cases**:
- Higher Education Policy Development: Bulgarian Ministry of Education uses automated extraction of 2011 census tertiary education completion data by gender to identify regional disparities and craft targeted scholarship programs for underrepresented groups.
- University Enrollment Planning: Academic planners analyze male vs. female graduation counts across qualification levels to forecast program demand and optimally allocate resources for engineering, humanities, and medical faculties.
- NGO Gender Equality Monitoring: A women’s rights organization tracks progress in female tertiary attainment by degree type using extracted census figures to inform advocacy campaigns, measure impact, and secure EU funding.
- Corporate Talent Acquisition Analysis: A multinational tech firm parses regional education completion rates by sex to tailor campus recruitment strategies, set diversity targets, and improve gender balance in its Bulgarian operations.
- EdTech Market Research: An education technology startup aggregates tertiary graduate demographics by gender in Bulgaria to segment its online course offerings, customize marketing messages, and validate product–market fit.
- Socioeconomic Impact Studies: Independent social researchers correlate gender-specific tertiary education levels with employment and income outcomes across Bulgarian municipalities by integrating the extracted data into econometric models.
- Urban Development and Workforce Planning: City planners leverage detailed gender-disaggregated graduate data to project future skilled labor availability, guide vocational training centers, and prioritize infrastructure investments in Bulgarian regions.
- Data Journalism and Visualization: A news outlet automates extraction of gendered tertiary education stats from the census PDF to build interactive dashboards and publish data-driven stories on Bulgaria’s educational parity trends.
