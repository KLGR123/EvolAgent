### Development Step 7: Identify Zamboanga del Sur Governor (1998‚Äì2007) Who Implemented Republic Act No. 711

**Description**: Research who served as the chief executive (governor) of Zamboanga del Sur Province from 1998 to 2007. Focus on identifying the person who was elected in 1998 and held the position for the entire period until 2007, as this person would have been responsible for implementing the foundational law (Republic Act No. 711) that established the province.

**Use Cases**:
- Automating the creation of a verified JSON profile of Zamboanga del Sur governors (1998‚Äì2007) for a political science dissertation on Mindanao leadership patterns
- Enabling provincial archives staff to cross-check tenure dates and implementational responsibilities under Republic Act No. 711 for museum exhibits on local governance
- Assisting investigative journalists in fact-checking claims about consecutive gubernatorial terms by parsing workspace research files and official election cycles
- Supporting civic-tech developers in building an open-data dashboard that tracks provincial election outcomes and leadership timelines using automated file inspection
- Empowering NGO election monitors to compile and validate historical election results from COMELEC and provincial government records in a structured research summary
- Equipping policy analysts to audit compliance with foundational provincial laws by generating detailed research profiles and identifying gaps via established research methodology
- Streamlining academic research teams‚Äô workflows by extracting confirmed and established facts from varied workspace documents for comparative governance studies
