### Development Step 1: Identify the oldest closed Regression issue in numpy.polynomial, record creation, closure, and label timestamps.

**Description**: Search GitHub for numpy.polynomial issues to identify all closed issues that have the 'Regression' label. Focus on finding the oldest closed issue with this label and determine when the 'Regression' label was added to that specific issue. Use GitHub's issue search functionality with filters for repository 'numpy/numpy', path 'polynomial', status 'closed', and label 'Regression'. Extract the issue creation date, closure date, and label addition timestamp for the oldest matching issue.

**Use Cases**:
- Regression audit for numpy.polynomial API stability in enterprise data pipelines to ensure model outputs remain consistent after library upgrades
- Proactive identification of historical polynomial regression issues for scientific simulation reproducibility in physics and engineering research
- Automated monitoring of numpy polynomial regressions in CI/CD workflows to catch algorithmic failures before production deployment
- Comparative analysis of regression fix timelines for polynomial interpolation functions to inform academic research code versioning
- Preparation of release notes by extracting creation, closure, and label-addition dates of regression issues in numpy.polynomial submodule
- Generating educational case studies on software regression patterns using real numpy polynomial issues for developer training
- Evaluating the impact of past regressions on polynomial fitting algorithms for financial risk modeling teams ensuring accuracy in quantitative analyses
