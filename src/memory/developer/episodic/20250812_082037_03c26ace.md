### Development Step 4: Which Frogs Member Substituted as Keyboardist for Prince‚Äôs Side Project The Family?

**Description**: Search for information about The Frogs band members, specifically focusing on identifying which member filled in as keyboardist for The_Family_(band), Prince's side project. Look for biographical information about The Frogs members (particularly Jimmy Flemion and Dennis Flemion), their musical collaborations, connections to Prince-related projects, and any instances where they served as substitute musicians for other bands. Cross-reference with information about The_Family_(band) to identify which keyboardist needed a replacement and when this occurred.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated verification of session musician credits in record label databases for royalty distribution audits
- Fact-checking musician lineup changes for entertainment journalists writing band biographies
- Generating structured research summaries for musicologists studying 1990s side-projects of major artists
- Archiving cross-referenced collaboration data for library special collections in popular music
- Populating metadata fields in online music encyclopedias (e.g., Discogs, AllMusic) with confirmed substitute musician details
- Legal discovery automation for entertainment lawyers handling disputes over performance credits
- Reporting and visualization of band personnel networks for data analysts mapping artist connections in the music industry
