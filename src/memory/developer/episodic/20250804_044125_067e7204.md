### Development Step 20: Extract Survivor Winners (Seasons 1–44) from Wikipedia into JSON

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Reality TV viewership analytics for network programming teams: ingest the Survivor winners list to correlate winner popularity with live and delayed DVR ratings and optimize future time slots
- Academic diversity and gender representation study in entertainment: compile historical Survivor winners data to analyze demographic trends and publish quantitative research on reality TV outcomes
- Automated trivia quiz content generation for mobile gaming apps: extract season-wise Survivor winners to automatically populate daily quiz questions and leaderboard challenges
- Recommendation engine enhancement for streaming platforms: integrate the structured winners timeline into user profiles to suggest similar reality shows based on past winner attributes
- Interactive infographic creation for media outlets: use the season-and-winner JSON to generate decade-by-decade visual timelines and shareable graphics on Survivor’s evolution
- Conversational AI integration on fan websites: feed the Survivor winners dataset into a chatbot’s knowledge base so users can ask “Who won season 12?” and receive instant answers
- Data science workshop module for web scraping best practices: demonstrate end-to-end extraction, parsing, and JSON output using the Survivor winners table as a hands-on exercise
- Content management automation for entertainment blogs: schedule post-finale jobs that scrape the latest winner data and auto-update blog posts or RSS feeds with the new champion information
