### Development Step 6: Identifying Authors Citing Griffin Trotter’s Tradition-Based Narrative Ethics in Fractured Medical Traditions

**Description**: Search for academic works that examine fractured tradition in medicine, analyze ethical dilemmas, and specifically apply Griffin Trotter's tradition-based narrative ethics theories. Focus on finding the author of such a work by searching for keywords like 'Griffin Trotter tradition-based narrative ethics medicine', 'fractured tradition medicine ethics', 'narrative ethics medical dilemmas', and 'tradition-based ethics healthcare'. Look for academic papers, books, or dissertations that cite Griffin Trotter's work while examining medical ethical issues through the lens of fractured traditions.

**Use Cases**:
- Hospital ethics boards automating literature retrieval of fractured tradition narratives to support case deliberations using Griffin Trotter’s framework
- Academic librarians deploying the search pipeline to curate and tag publications on tradition-based narrative ethics for digital archives
- Bioethics graduate students running automated keyword queries to identify seminal works and authors in fractured tradition medicine for thesis literature reviews
- University curriculum committees mapping key concepts from Griffin Trotter’s “The Loyal Physician” to design new medical ethics course modules
- Research grant writers quickly gathering author credentials and institutional affiliations for proposals on narrative ethics in healthcare funding applications
- Digital humanities teams extracting metadata and text snippets from ethics literature to train NLP models on tradition-based medical narratives
- Academic publishers using automated scans of search results to scout expert contributors for an edited volume on fractured tradition in medical ethics
- Clinical decision support developers integrating extracted ethical frameworks and narrative examples into physician guidance systems for nuanced patient care
