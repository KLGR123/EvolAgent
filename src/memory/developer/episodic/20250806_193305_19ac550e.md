### Development Step 13: Total Peer-Reviewed Research Articles Published in Nature in 2020

**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated departmental publication tracking and performance benchmarking for annual faculty reviews at universities
- Research funding agency compliance dashboard generation for evaluating grant recipients‚Äô article output
- Journal editorial planning automation for end-of-year reporting of peer-reviewed article volumes
- Scientometric consultancy trend analysis and forecasting of research output in high-impact journals
- Academic library acquisition optimization based on yearly research article counts to inform subscription budgets
- Science news platform automated alerts and content feeds for publication milestones in top-tier journals
- Policy think tank monitoring of global research output trends for evidence-based decision making
- Competitor benchmarking for emerging journals to compare publication volumes against industry leaders
