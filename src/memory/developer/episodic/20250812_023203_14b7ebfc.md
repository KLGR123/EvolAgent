### Development Step 21: Find French-born Pioneer Pictures Composer of 1976 Montreal Olympics Theme Music

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements and search for alternative composers who both worked for Pioneer Pictures and composed theme music for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. The previous research focused on André Mathieu who was born in Canada, not France, which doesn't match the TASK criteria. Search for other composers associated with the 1976 Montreal Olympics who might have French origins and Pioneer Pictures connections, including any secondary composers, arrangers, or musicians involved in the Olympic ceremonies who had film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Film archival research validation for preserving accurate composer credits and Pioneer Pictures affiliations in a digital museum catalog
- Music licensing due diligence for verifying French-born composers’ ties to Pioneer Pictures and the 1976 Montreal Olympics before securing broadcast rights
- Quality assurance in sports broadcast metadata to ensure correct composer attribution in Olympic archival footage for a national broadcaster
- Automated legal compliance check in a music rights management system to cross-verify composer credentials and studio connections
- Data-driven academic study on the cultural impact of French composers in major sporting events using structured search result analysis
- Journalistic fact-checking workflow for investigating claims about composer involvement in film studios and Olympic ceremonies
- Metadata enrichment pipeline for a streaming service to append accurate composer, studio, and event information to its Olympic-themed content catalog
- Corporate due diligence tool for entertainment M&A teams to validate composer-studio-event relationships in target film libraries
