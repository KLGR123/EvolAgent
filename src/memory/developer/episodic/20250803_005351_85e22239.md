### Development Step 16: Determine Largest and Smallest Washington County Seats by Area and Retrieve Their 2020 Census Populations

**Description**: Identify the largest and smallest county seats by land area from the complete dataset of 39 Washington state county seats with their land area measurements. Then extract the 2020 census population data for these two specific county seats using the official data.census.gov source as specified in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban planning and zoning optimization for county commissions using land‐area extremes and 2020 census population data to prioritize infrastructure projects in Washington’s smallest and largest county seats
- Real estate investment analysis by brokerage firms comparing population density in the geographically smallest versus largest Washington county seats to identify emerging housing markets
- Emergency management resource allocation for the Washington State Department of Emergency Services, balancing response strategies between sprawling rural county seats and compact urban ones based on land area and census figures
- Environmental impact assessment by conservation NGOs evaluating human footprint in the most expansive and most confined county seats to guide habitat protection initiatives
- Healthcare facility network design for public health agencies, determining optimal clinic placement by correlating geographic size with population in Washington’s extreme county seats
- Tourism development planning by regional travel boards tailoring visitor experiences to the demographic and spatial profiles of the smallest and largest county seats
- Transportation infrastructure feasibility studies by the Washington State Department of Transportation, modeling transit options in low‐density, high‐area versus high‐density, low‐area county seats using extracted census data
- Academic urban studies research at universities investigating the relationship between land area and population dynamics in Washington’s smallest and largest county seats for peer‐reviewed publication
