### Development Step 23: Extract Survivor US Seasons 1–44 Winners from Wikipedia to JSON File

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- The editorial team at a TV network automates their “Survivor Winners Timeline” feature by pulling the JSON list nightly to ensure seasons 1–44 winners are always up to date on their fan portal
- A startup building a Survivor-themed mobile trivia game seeds and refreshes its question database automatically with new winners after each season finale
- A media analytics firm analyzes diversity trends by feeding the structured winners data into their BI dashboards to study demographic shifts across seasons 1–44
- The digital marketing department at CBS drives weekly social media campaigns by auto-generating “On this day” posts featuring past Survivor winners and their season details
- A data journalist uses the extracted JSON to rapidly build interactive web visualizations correlating winners’ vote margins, season themes, and final tribal council stats
- An instructor in a data science bootcamp provides the scraping pipeline as a hands-on lab assignment to teach students HTML parsing, data cleaning, and JSON serialization
- A fantasy reality-TV league platform populates user dashboards with official Survivor winners to compare community predictions against actual outcomes
- A chatbot integrated into a Survivor fan forum queries the JSON file in real time to answer questions like “Who won Season 12?” without manual lookup
