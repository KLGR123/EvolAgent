- Automated catalog verification for a record label conducting a rights audit of Fiona Apple and Paula Cole’s early discography
- Discography enrichment for a fan-driven mobile app that displays release timelines and album details in an interactive UI
- Data preparation for a university musicology research project analyzing trends in female singer-songwriter albums during the 1990s
- Backend automation in a digital music archive ensuring complete, date-accurate entries for studio albums and EPs before 1999
- Content sourcing for a podcast production team creating an episode series on landmark ’90s albums by female artists
- Integration into a music recommendation engine feeding historical release data to improve vintage playlist curation algorithms
- Quality assurance for a licensing agency verifying exact release dates when negotiating pre-1999 sync rights for Fiona Apple and Paula Cole tracks
