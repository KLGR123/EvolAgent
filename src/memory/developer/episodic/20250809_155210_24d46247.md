### Development Step 29: First Australian to manage Notts County or with Italian kit ties at English clubs

**Description**: Search for information about which Australian football manager was the first to manage Notts County specifically, or alternatively search for any Australian managers who have managed English clubs with historical Italian kit connections. Focus on finding if there's a different Australian manager than Harry Kewell who managed an English club that actually sent replica kits to Italian clubs. Search for keywords including 'Australian manager Notts County', 'first Australian football manager Italian kit connection', 'Australian coach English club Juventus connection', and 'Notts County Australian manager history'.

**Use Cases**:
- Professional football scouting automation: using the solution to identify lesser-known Australian coaches who managed English clubs like Notts County and uncover their Italian kit partnerships for targeted recruitment pitches.
- Sports journalism research workflow: compiling and verifying background stories on Australian managers’ tenures and historic kit exchanges with Italian clubs to enrich magazine features and broadcast segments.
- Football memorabilia authentication for e-commerce: scraping records of English clubs that shipped replica kits to Italy under Australian management to validate and describe jerseys sold to collectors.
- Academic sports history data collection: creating a structured dataset of first Australian football managers, their club appointments, and Italian kit connections for publication in sports history journals.
- Apparel marketing campaign planning: identifying English clubs with Italian kit ties under Australian coaches to design region-specific, limited-edition jersey releases in Italy and Australia.
- Club heritage archiving and digital exhibition: automating web searches to document and curate the history of Australian managers at Notts County and related Italian kit stories for museum displays.
- Diversity and representation analytics: aggregating web-sourced manager appointment data to analyze the prevalence and impact of Australian coaches in English football, with a focus on cross-country kit collaborations.
- Legal and compliance due diligence: verifying historical arrangements between English clubs, Australian managers, and Italian kit suppliers to support contract negotiations and ensure regulatory adherence.
