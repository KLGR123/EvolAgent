### Development Step 25: Comma-Delimited Cities of Westernmost Santa Clara and Easternmost UMass Boston Universities

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- Recruitment travel route optimization for university admissions teams planning coast-to-coast campus tours starting in Santa Clara and ending in Boston
- National shipping schedule automation for educational material distribution services calculating pickup at the westernmost point (Santa Clara) and drop-off at the easternmost point (Boston)
- Comparative educational research analyzing enrollment trends by using the westernmost and easternmost universities as geographic benchmarks for west-to-east cross-sectional studies
- GIS data validation workflows in campus mapping systems verifying that Santa Clara University and UMass Boston coordinates are correctly represented at the extremes of the dataset
- Marketing segmentation for online learning platforms targeting students at the farthest west and east locations to measure regional engagement differences
- Logistics planning for national academic conference organizers scheduling equipment delivery from the west coast (Santa Clara) to the east coast (Boston)
- Vendor contract negotiations for campus services demonstrating coverage from the westernmost to the easternmost university to secure nationwide service agreements
- Emergency response drill coordination for university networks simulating communication and support between the coast-to-coast endpoints at Santa Clara University and UMass Boston
