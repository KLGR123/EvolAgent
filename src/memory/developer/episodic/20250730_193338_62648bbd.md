### Development Step 4: Identify author of fractured medical tradition ethics research using Griffin Trotter’s narrative ethics

**Description**: Search for academic works that examine fractured tradition in medicine, analyze ethical dilemmas, and specifically apply Griffin Trotter's tradition-based narrative ethics theories. Focus on finding the author of such a work by searching for keywords like 'Griffin Trotter tradition-based narrative ethics medicine', 'fractured tradition medicine ethics', 'narrative ethics medical dilemmas', and 'tradition-based ethics healthcare'. Look for academic papers, books, or dissertations that cite Griffin Trotter's work while examining medical ethical issues through the lens of fractured traditions.

**Use Cases**:
- Systematic review for a hospital ethics committee to develop guidelines on tradition-based narrative ethics by sourcing works that apply Griffin Trotter’s theories.
- Doctoral scholar mapping the network of publications on fractured medical traditions and identifying key authors through targeted SerpAPI queries.
- Bioethics journal editor compiling and vetting manuscripts for a special issue on narrative ethics by locating seminal works citing Griffin Trotter.
- Healthcare AI team curating a training dataset of academic papers on tradition-based ethics to build automated tools for analyzing ethical arguments.
