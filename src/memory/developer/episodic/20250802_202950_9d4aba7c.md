### Development Step 11: Eliud Kipchoge’s Time to Run 356,400 km at 20.90 km/h, Rounded to Nearest 1000 Hours

**Description**: Calculate the time required for Eliud Kipchoge to run the Earth-Moon minimum perigee distance using his marathon world record pace. Use Kipchoge's pace of 20.90 km/h from the previous analysis and the minimum perigee distance of 356,400 km from the Moon's Wikipedia page. Convert the result to thousand hours and round to the nearest 1000 hours as specified in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Physics education module calculating time-distance relationships by having students use Eliud Kipchoge’s marathon pace to run the Earth-Moon perigee distance, reinforcing kinematics and unit conversions.
- Science museum interactive exhibit where visitors input various running speeds (e.g., Kipchoge’s 20.90 km/h) to compute and visualize time required to cover astronomical distances, teaching STEM concepts through engagement.
- Sports analytics seminar demonstrating how elite runner paces translate into extreme endurance scenarios—like hypothetically running to the Moon—to illustrate pacing strategies and the importance of rounding rules in performance projections.
- EdTech programming workshop guiding learners step-by-step through building a Python script that calculates distance/speed/time, applies rounding to the nearest 1,000 hours, and exports results to JSON for data literacy education.
- Data engineering training exercise showing how to design a simple ETL pipeline: ingest known constants, perform calculations, enforce rounding policies, and persist outputs in a workspace for downstream analytics.
- Science journalism feature generating infographic-ready figures by computing and rounding the time it would take a world-record marathoner to reach lunar perigee, making complex astronomical scales relatable to the general public.
- Video game development tool that uses realistic pacing algorithms to assign in-game durations for ultra-long “moon run” events, rounding gameplay time to thousand-hour blocks for narrative consistency.
- Corporate business intelligence workshop modeling how to automate metric calculations—distance, speed, time—with custom rounding requirements and saving results in JSON to integrate into executive dashboards.
