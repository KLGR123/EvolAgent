### Development Step 19: Sort birth cities from presidential_birthplaces.json records with minimum and maximum longitudes

**Description**: Identify the records in workspace/presidential_birthplaces.json with the minimum longitude and the maximum longitude, extract their birth_city values, sort those two city names alphabetically, and output them as a comma-separated list.

**Use Cases**:
- Identifying the westernmost and easternmost presidential birth cities to generate an interactive U.S. history road-trip planner featuring state travel tips
- Automating quality assurance in a government GIS dataset by flagging records with extreme longitude values for manual verification
- Powering an educational app module that quizzes students on the geography of presidential birthplaces by highlighting the two farthest apart cities
- Generating a dynamic map overlay for a political news website that marks the easternmost and westernmost birth locations of U.S. presidents
- Enriching a travel blog’s “Presidential Routes” section by automatically extracting and alphabetically sorting the extreme-longitude birth cities
- Supporting a demographic research project that analyzes geographic dispersion of presidential birthplaces by isolating boundary cases
- Integrating into a civic-education chatbot to quickly answer “Which president was born farthest west or east?” by fetching and sorting birth city names
