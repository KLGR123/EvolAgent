### Development Step 14: Estimating False Positive Papers in Nature’s 2020 Publications Using a 4% Type-I Error Rate

**Description**: Calculate the number of statistically incorrect papers using the false positive rate principle. Given that Nature published 1,002 research articles in 2020, all assumed to rely on statistical significance with an average p-value of 0.04, determine how many would be incorrectly claiming statistical significance. Apply the concept that a p-value of 0.04 means there's a 4% chance of a false positive (Type I error) when the null hypothesis is true. Calculate 1,002 × 0.04 and round up to the next integer as specified in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic journal editorial board uses the calculation to estimate how many cancer-biology papers published in 2020 may be falsely claiming novel biomarkers, guiding more rigorous peer‐review standards
- Pharmaceutical R&D risk assessment team applies the false-positive rate principle to their preclinical efficacy studies to predict the number of drug candidates likely to fail in Phase II trials due to statistical flukes
- Regulatory agency (e.g., FDA) implements the solution to audit submitted clinical trial reports and estimate how many efficacy claims could be Type I errors before approving new therapies
- Grant review panels at a national science foundation use the calculation on past proposal outcomes to gauge the prevalence of spurious pilot‐study results informing funding decisions
- Meta-analysis researchers in cognitive psychology apply the method across hundreds of published studies to quantify the expected proportion of false positives influencing overall effect‐size estimates
- Science journalists at a major media outlet leverage the approach to flag press releases from high-impact journals that might overstate findings due to Type I errors, streamlining fact-checking workflows
- University research integrity office employs the calculation to monitor departmental publication quality, identifying fields with unusually high false-positive rates for targeted statistical training
