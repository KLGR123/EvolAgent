### Development Step 56: Extract 2011 Bulgarian Census Tertiary Education Graduates by Gender from PDF file

**Description**: Extract the specific tertiary education completion data by gender from the downloaded Census2011final_en.pdf file in the workspace. Parse the document to locate the section containing tertiary education graduates by educational-qualification degree and sex, then extract the exact numbers of men and women who completed tertiary education according to the 2011 Bulgarian census.

**Use Cases**:
- Government policy analysis for designing gender-targeted higher education initiatives by extracting male and female tertiary graduation rates from national census data
- Academic research on regional gender disparities in university attainment, automating the extraction of precise graduate counts by sex for statistical studies
- Corporate human resources diversity planning by analyzing local workforce qualifications from census figures on men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs tertiary education completion
- Nonprofit program evaluation to monitor progress on gender equality in education by retrieving exact numbers of male and female degree holders from official census reports
- Data journalism for investigative stories on the gender gap in higher education, quickly pulling out tertiary graduate statistics by sex from extensive PDF documents
- EdTech product personalization that adapts learning modules based on regional gender-specific higher education completion trends derived from census data
- International development reporting to track UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 (quality education and gender parity) by extracting sex-disaggregated tertiary education figures from the latest census PDF
