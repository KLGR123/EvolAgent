### Development Step 2: Seahorse Island Full-House Rentals With Swimming Amenities, Family-Friendly Features, and Availability Status

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/366e2f2b-8632-4ef2-81eb-bc3877489217.pdf to extract information about all accommodations in Seahorse Island. Focus on identifying properties that offer full house rentals and have swimming amenities (pools, beach access, or water features). Extract details including accommodation names, property types, amenities, availability status, and any family-friendly features to enable comparison of options suitable for a family seeking a full house with swimming facilities.

**Use Cases**:
- Travel agency itinerary automation by parsing PDF catalogs of Seahorse Island lodgings to curate full-house rentals with pools and beach access for family vacation packages
- Vacation rental aggregator platform extracting detailed amenities and availability from island property PDF reports to dynamically update swim-friendly listings for parents planning trips
- Real estate investment analysis tool processing PDF accommodation data to evaluate full-house rentals with water features for ROI projections and portfolio diversification
- Local tourism board content management system summarizing PDF accommodation brochures to highlight family-oriented swim-enabled properties on official island visitor websites
- Property management CRM integration that ingests PDF booking and amenity details to automatically recommend available family-friendly houses with pools to repeat guests
- Hospitality market research solution scanning competitor PDF listings to identify gaps in full-house swim amenity offerings on Seahorse Island for strategic service expansion
- Insurance underwriting pre-screening process parsing PDF descriptions of rental houses with water features to assess property risk and streamline quote generation for seasonal policies
