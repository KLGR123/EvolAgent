### Development Step 5: 2018-2019 Customer Retention Models by Kashyap and Fader: Common Two-Word Model Type

**Description**: Conduct a focused academic literature search for research papers on customer retention studies published during 2018-2019 by authors Manash Pratim Kashyap and PS Fader. Use academic search engines like Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or academic databases. Focus the search on terms like 'Manash Pratim Kashyap customer retention 2018-2019' and 'PS Fader customer retention 2018-2019'. Extract information about the models used in their respective studies, looking specifically for any common two-word model type mentioned in both authors' works.

**Use Cases**:
- Retail loyalty program optimization using extracted models from 2018–2019 retention studies to forecast repeat purchase behavior
- SaaS subscription churn prediction framework selection by comparing Pareto/NBD and similar two-word models identified in academic papers
- Marketing consultancy development of a client-ready retention model library aggregated from Kashyap and Fader publications
- Financial services risk team integrating customer-base audit insights into credit card retention strategies
- E-commerce platform automating recommendation of the optimal retention model based on literature search outcomes
- University research group performing a meta-analysis of two-word customer retention models published in 2018–2019
- Business intelligence department generating an executive report on best-practice retention modeling drawn from targeted academic sources

We discuss a series of questions that such an audit should address, along with metrics commonly used to answer them. The most basic measures focus on customer acquisition and retention. Using the Pareto/NBD model and similar approaches, we can use these to generate predictions about future purchasing at the level of both individual customers and the entire base of current customers.",
