### Development Step 1: 1879 U.S. Territory High Schools, Non-Voting Delegate Elections, and NM Heart Institute Billing Office Buildings

**Description**: Research U.S. territories that established their first public high school in 1879 and identify which territory elected a non-voting delegate to Congress that same year. Focus on territorial histories, educational milestones, and congressional delegation records from 1879. Look for connections between early territorial high schools and later medical facilities, specifically any buildings that housed the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office.

**Use Cases**:
- State education department curriculum development on 19th-century territorial school history, using the research pipeline to integrate accurate founding dates and locations of first public high schools into statewide lesson plans
- Museum exhibit planning for the New Mexico History Museum, leveraging compiled 1879 territorial delegate elections and high school milestones to create an interactive political-education display
- Real estate development firm specializing in historic preservation, using lineage data from 1879 territorial records to identify Albuquerque buildings suitable for adaptive reuse as medical administration offices
- Marketing team at the New Mexico Heart Institute performing heritage branding by tracing the billing officeâ€™s building back to its territorial-era roots for authenticity-driven promotional campaigns
- University research group conducting a comparative analysis of education and political development in Western territories, automating data extraction of high school establishments and non-voting delegate elections for peer-reviewed publications
- GIS specialists designing an educational tourism app that maps 1879 first public high school sites alongside non-voting delegate election locations to create self-guided historical trails in New Mexico
- Legal due-diligence consultants compiling chained property records of an 1879 territorial-era building to verify title, condition, and historic designation for planned hospital expansion in Albuquerque
