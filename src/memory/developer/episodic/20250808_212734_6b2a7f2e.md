### Development Step 5: Identify 2020 Documentary Title, Composer, and Director of ‘Run Home Slow’ 1963 B-Movie Score

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the 2020 documentary that includes archival footage from the 1960s and focuses on a composer who wrote the soundtrack for the 1963 B movie 'Run Home Slow'. Search for keywords including '2020 documentary archival footage 1960s composer', 'Run Home Slow 1963 B movie soundtrack composer', 'documentary 2020 composer 1960s footage', and 'Run Home Slow soundtrack who composed'. Focus on identifying both the specific 2020 documentary title and the composer it focuses on, as well as the director of this documentary.

**Use Cases**:
- Film festival programming and metadata extraction for selecting and curating archival-footage documentaries
- Musicology academic research and composer-focused source analysis for scholarly publications
- Streaming platform metadata enrichment and release-year correction for documentary catalogs
- Legal due diligence workflow for verifying director and composer credits in film licensing agreements
- Journalism fact-checking and automated film attribute extraction for documentary reviews and press articles
- University film studies curriculum development and archival footage content mapping for course materials
- Library archiving and cataloging automation for accurate film metadata and archival resource tracking
- Marketing analytics for film distributors monitoring 2020 documentary mentions featuring specific composers
