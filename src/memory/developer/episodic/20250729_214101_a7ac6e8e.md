### Development Step 8: Identify the Employee Who Didnâ€™t Give a Gift by Comparing Assigned and Actual Gift-Givers

**Description**: Determine which employee did not give a gift by comparing the list of twelve employees who were assigned to give gifts against the eleven gifts that were actually given. Cross-reference each actual gift with its giver based on the recipient's profile interests, then identify which of the twelve assigned gift-givers is missing from the actual gift exchange list.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate Secret Santa compliance auditing and missing gift-giver detection for HR holiday programs
- Remote software team gift exchange tracking and automated gift-matching verification for distributed engineering teams
- University alumni holiday book-swap coordination with profile-based matching and non-delivery alerts for advancement offices
- Non-profit toy drive sponsor reconciliation and missing-donation flagging for charity event organizers
- Professional conference attendee swag exchange auditing and unshipped item identification for event planners
- Online gaming guild interest-based gift distribution and lapsed-donor notification for community managers
- Retail chain employee gift card exchange auditing and unfulfilled-issuance monitoring for store operations
- Extended family holiday gift exchange management with interest matching and missing-donor reporting for family coordinators
