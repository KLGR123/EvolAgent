### Development Step 3: Goldfinger Ending: Bond & Pussy Galore‚Äôs Cover Objects and Their Colors

**Description**: Search for detailed information about the ending of the 1964 James Bond film 'Goldfinger' starring Sean Connery. Focus specifically on the final scenes where James Bond and Pussy Galore (played by Honor Blackman) take cover or conceal themselves. Look for descriptions of any objects they use for concealment, paying particular attention to the colors of these objects. Search multiple sources including movie databases (IMDb, Wikipedia), film reviews, plot summaries, and James Bond fan sites to ensure accuracy of the color details.
