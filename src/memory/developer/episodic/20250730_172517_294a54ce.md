### Development Step 27: List Cities of Westernmost Santa Clara University and Easternmost UMass Boston

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated geographic boundary detection for a university marketing team to launch targeted west/east coast email campaigns, identifying Santa Clara and Boston campuses as endpoints.
- GIS-driven infrastructure planning in a nationwide educational consortium, programmatically locating the westernmost and easternmost member institutions for network optimization.
- Logistics route optimization for academic book distributors, determining the extreme pickup (Santa Clara) and delivery (Boston) university cities to streamline shipping schedules.
- Higher education research on regional funding disparities, automatically extracting extreme campus locations to define study boundaries between Santa Clara and Boston.
- Student housing investment analysis, marking coast-to-coast extremes in university markets (Santa Clara and Boston) to guide real estate development decisions.
- IT capacity planning for a cloud provider, identifying the geographic spread of university data centers (from Santa Clara to Boston) to optimize server deployment.
- Sustainability assessment in campus operations, pinpointing the farthest western and eastern universities (Santa Clara and Boston) to model carbon footprint scenarios.
- Virtual campus tour series design, creating a guided itinerary from the westernmost university (Santa Clara) to the easternmost (Boston) for prospective students.
