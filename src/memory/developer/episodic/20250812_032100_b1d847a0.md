### Development Step 14: Sponsor of December 1897 $25 Soldier’s Pension Bill for Auburn Methodist Mission Founder

**Description**: Research the December 1897 legislation that granted $25 monthly soldier's pensions to identify who introduced the specific bill that benefited the Civil War veteran who established the Auburn Methodist Episcopal Church South Mission in 1903. Focus on Congressional records from December 1897, particularly the Disability Pension Act or related veteran pension legislation. Search for the bill's sponsor, co-sponsors, and legislative history to determine which member of Congress introduced this pension legislation that ultimately benefited the Auburn institution founder.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogical researchers tracing Civil War ancestors’ pension entitlements by extracting sponsor and legislative details from December 1897 Congressional records
- University history departments automating archival searches to support doctoral dissertations on post-Civil War veterans’ benefits legislation
- Library and archival staff building pipelines to scrape, clean, and catalog historical legislative data for public research portals
- Legal policy analysts compiling sponsorship histories of disability pension acts to evaluate modern veteran benefits reform proposals
- Museum exhibit developers generating contextual biographical summaries of Congressional sponsors for Civil War–era memorabilia displays
- Nonprofit veteran advocacy groups identifying historical champions of soldier pensions to craft heritage-driven fundraising campaigns
- Digital humanities teams mapping 19th-century legislative networks by programmatically scraping sponsor and committee metadata for interactive visualizations
