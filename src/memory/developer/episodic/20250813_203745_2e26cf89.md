### Development Step 7: Title:  
Identify US Survivor Winners Born in May Using Official Sources and Winner Birth Date Lists (Seasons 1–44)

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about US Survivor winners and their birth dates. Focus on finding official sources such as CBS Survivor databases, Wikipedia pages, or entertainment databases that list all winners from Season 1 through the most recent season available as of August 2023. Extract winner names, seasons, and birth dates to identify any winners born in May.

**Use Cases**:
- Entertainment journalism research for compiling accurate birthday features on Survivor winners, especially for "On This Day" or birthday spotlight articles
- Automated database enrichment for TV trivia apps or Survivor fan sites, ensuring winner profiles include verified birth dates and special highlights for May-born winners
- Academic studies on demographic trends of reality TV show winners, enabling sociologists to analyze age, birth month, or generational patterns among Survivor champions
- Event planning for Survivor-themed parties or conventions, allowing organizers to schedule celebrations or social media campaigns around winners' birthdays, particularly those in May
- Data validation and cross-referencing for casting agencies or talent scouts seeking to verify contestant ages and backgrounds from authoritative sources
- Automated content curation for social media managers running Survivor fan pages, enabling scheduled posts celebrating winners’ birthdays with accurate information and links
