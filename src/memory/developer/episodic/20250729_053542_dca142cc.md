### Development Step 7: Legume Wikipedia 2022 Logs: Identify Violated Content Type and Define “R” in Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Nonprofit Wikipedia oversight reporting: Volunteers automate extraction of 2022 content violations on the Legume page to create training materials that improve community guideline compliance.
- Media fact‐checking workflow: A newsroom integrates the solution to flag policy‐violating edits on botanical topics before December 2022 as part of their verification pipeline.
- Corporate knowledge management audit: An enterprise mirrors public Wikipedia logs into its internal wiki and uses this code to detect and remove content that breaches core policy standards.
- Academic research on online governance: Scholars parse violation incidents and policy interpretations from Legume’s logs to quantify trends in user‐generated content moderation for a peer‐reviewed study.
- AI training data curation: A machine learning engineer filters out any text from pre‐December 2022 Wikipedia dumps that violated core policies, ensuring only reliable, policy‐compliant data is used.
- Digital archival quality audit: A library’s digital preservation team runs the script on archived Wikipedia snapshots to verify adherence to NPOV, Verifiability, and No Original Research policies.
- Legal risk assessment: A consultancy analyzes public log violations for trademark or defamation risks on the Legume page, advising clients on potential exposure from user edits.
