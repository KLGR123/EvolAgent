### Development Step 7: Extract Survivor Winners for Seasons 1–44 from Wikipedia into JSON File

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated content update for a reality‐TV fan portal, ensuring the latest Survivor winners list is always current
- Data integration into a TV network’s internal database for metadata enrichment and broadcast scheduling
- Trivia game question bank generation and periodic refresh for mobile apps and pub quizzes
- Social media calendar automation, scheduling weekly “On This Day” winner highlights for marketing campaigns
- Academic research on diversity and gender trends in reality television using structured winner data
- Podcast show notes and script automation, pulling in winner details for episode outlines
- Interactive data journalism feature, visualizing Survivor winner demographics and season comparisons
