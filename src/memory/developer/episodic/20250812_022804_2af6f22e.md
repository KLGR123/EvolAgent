### Development Step 9: Find Pioneer Pictures Composer Who Wrote 1976 Montreal Olympics Theme First Used Pre-1984

**Description**: Search for composers who worked for Pioneer Pictures and also composed the theme music for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Focus on identifying which composer employed by Pioneer Pictures created the Olympic theme that was first used in an international event before 1984. Search for keywords including 'Pioneer Pictures composer 1976 Montreal Olympics theme', 'Montreal Olympics 1976 theme music composer Pioneer Pictures', 'Olympic fanfare 1976 composer film studio', and cross-reference Pioneer Pictures staff composers with Olympic music creators from that era.

**Use Cases**:
- Film archivist automates cross-referencing Pioneer Pictures’ composer rosters with 1976 Montreal Olympics theme credits to update and normalize metadata in a digital film archive
- Music licensing team uses targeted Python searches and pattern matching to verify whether Pioneer Pictures’ composers hold rights to Olympic theme music composed before 1984, ensuring accurate royalty distribution
- Academic researcher processes JSON search outputs to map career trajectories of André Mathieu and Vic Vogel across film studios and international sporting events for a cultural history publication
- Rights clearance attorney runs scripted keyword queries and regex extraction on online search results to confirm contract overlaps between Pioneer Pictures and Olympic committees for due-diligence reports
- Media metadata specialist leverages the analysis code to pull composer names and event contexts from web search JSON and enrich an entertainment industry knowledge graph
- Digital humanities lab deploys the search-and-extract pipeline to establish linkages between film studio composers and major global events, building an interactive timeline of music at the Olympics
- Data journalist uses the cross-referencing script to fact-check an investigative piece on how a Pioneer Pictures composer came to write the 1976 Montreal Olympic fanfare
