### Development Step 6: Extract Official Land Area Figures for 39 Washington State County Seats

**Description**: Research and extract the land area data for all 39 Washington state county seats that were identified in the previous step. Use authoritative sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, official city websites, or government geographic databases to obtain the land area measurements for each county seat city. Focus on finding the official land area figures in square miles or square kilometers for accurate comparison.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban infrastructure optimization for Washington county seats by comparing city land areas to prioritize road maintenance and utility expansion budgets
- Emergency services deployment planning that uses county seat land area data to model ambulance and fire station coverage zones
- Real estate development site selection analyzing land area and urban footprint in Washington county seats to identify high-growth investment opportunities
- Regional transit network design leveraging county seat spatial dimensions to plan efficient bus routes and stop placements
- Environmental impact assessments for stormwater management projects by correlating impervious surfaces with total land area in each county seat
- Agricultural zoning and urban growth boundary decisions informed by county seat land area metrics to balance farmland preservation and city expansion
- Tourism route and park placement strategy for Washington county seats based on city size to optimize walking tours and recreational space allocation
- Public health outreach resource estimation using county seat land area figures to scale door-to-door vaccination and community health programs
