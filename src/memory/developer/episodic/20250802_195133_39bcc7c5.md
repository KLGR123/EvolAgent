### Development Step 41: Identify shared critical word in two authors’ quotes from Midkiff’s June 2014 Fafnir article

**Description**: Access Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the Fafnir journal to extract the full text and identify the specific word that was quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions. Parse the article content systematically to locate quotes from multiple authors that contain the same critical word about dragon portrayals.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic literature review automation for humanities scholars to extract and compare thematic criticisms across multiple authors in journal articles
- Journalism editorial workflow to scan interview transcripts and flag identical impactful quotes used by different sources
- Legal e-discovery processing to identify repeated objectionable terms quoted by multiple witnesses in deposition transcripts
- E-commerce customer feedback analysis to find the same critical word appearing in reviews from different users, highlighting recurring product pain points
- Pharmaceutical safety monitoring to detect a common adverse event descriptor quoted in separate case reports for regulatory reporting
- Cyber threat intelligence gathering to uncover recurring codewords or phrases used by distinct threat actors in intercepted communications
- Publishing quality assurance to scan author submissions for duplicated editorial comments or critiques across different chapters or manuscripts
