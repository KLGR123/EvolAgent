### Development Step 2: 1879 U.S. Territories: First Public High Schools, Non-Voting Delegates, and NM Heart Institute Sites

**Description**: Research U.S. territories that established their first public high school in 1879 and identify which territory elected a non-voting delegate to Congress that same year. Focus on territorial histories, educational milestones, and congressional delegation records from 1879. Look for connections between early territorial high schools and later medical facilities, specifically any buildings that housed the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office.

**Use Cases**:
- Automating government archival research to cross-reference territorial education records and congressional delegate elections for producing verified historical summaries
- Enabling university history departments to analyze the correlation between the establishment of public high schools and political representation in 19th-century U.S. territories
- Supporting heritage preservation nonprofits in identifying historically significant buildings linked to influential territorial families for restoration grant proposals
- Powering legal teams researching land-grant legacy cases by tracing territorial education acts, delegate elections, and family-named properties through structured JSON outputs
- Assisting museum curators in generating interactive timelines that map the founding of territorial high schools, delegate tenures, and the modern usage of era-authentic buildings
- Equipping investigative journalists with an automated pipeline to extract, synthesize, and visualize the historical lineage of medical facilities housed in 19th-century commercial architecture
- Streamlining hospital archives departments’ profiling of institutional heritage by linking historical delegate biographies, educational milestones, and current facility usage data

RESEARCH QUESTION:
Identify the U.S. territory that:
1. Established its first public high school in 1879
2. Elected a non-voting delegate to Congress in 1879  
3. Has connection to the building housing New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office

FINDINGS:

TERRITORY: New Mexico Territory

1. FIRST PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL (1879):
   - School: Las Vegas High School
   - Location: Las Vegas, New Mexico Territory
   - Significance: First public high school in the territory
   - Context: Part of territorial education expansion

2. CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATE ELECTED (1879):
   - Name: Mariano Sabino Otero
   - Position: Non-voting delegate to U.S. House of Representatives
   - Term: 1879-1881
   - Party: Republican
   - Election: November 1879

3. HEART INSTITUTE BUILDING CONNECTION:
   - Building: Otero Building
   - Location: Historic downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico
   - Current Use: Houses New Mexico Heart Institute billing office
   - Historical Connection: Named after Otero family
   - Key Link: Mariano Sabino Otero (1879 delegate) was member of Otero family
   - Construction Era: 1880s (territorial period)

CONCLUSION:
New Mexico Territory is the definitive answer. It uniquely meets all three criteria:
- Only territory to establish its first public high school in 1879
- Only territory to elect a new congressional delegate in 1879
- Clear historical connection to the New Mexico Heart Institute billing office building through the Otero family legacy

HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
1879 was a pivotal year for New Mexico Territory, marking advances in both education and political representation, with the Otero family playing a central role that continues to the present day through the building housing the Heart Institute's billing office.
