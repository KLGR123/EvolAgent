### Development Step 36: Identify Australian Captain in Arthur Morris‚Äôs Pre-1973-74 Test 300+ Innings

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Fact-checking political debate statements by parsing JSON search results for claimed statistics, categorizing supportive evidence versus refutations, and compiling a definitive verification report
- Auditing pharmaceutical marketing claims by analyzing web search result dumps in JSON for drug efficacy statements, separating validated clinical studies from misleading snippets, and summarizing compliance status
- Conducting competitive retail pricing intelligence by ingesting JSON search results of competitor websites, identifying promotional price claims over 50%, and generating automated price-monitoring dashboards
- Automating academic literature reviews by processing JSON search outputs for mentions of a target methodology, quantifying supporting versus contradictory publications, and delivering a trend analysis summary
- Monitoring brand sentiment on social media by collecting JSON streams of tweets and posts containing the brand name, classifying entries into positive endorsements, complaints, or neutral mentions, and producing weekly sentiment and claim reports
- Verifying financial disclosure accuracy by scanning SEC filing search results in JSON format for references to ‚Äúrevenue growth above 20%,‚Äù flagging inconsistencies, and compiling an executive summary of discrepancies
- Ensuring environmental compliance in impact assessments by parsing JSON search results for mentions of emission thresholds, categorizing confirmed violations versus compliant statements, and creating a regulatory compliance dashboard
