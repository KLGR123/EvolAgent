### Development Step 19: Identify French-Origin Film Composers at Pioneer Pictures Who Composed 1976 Montreal Olympics Music

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements and search for alternative composers who both worked for Pioneer Pictures and composed theme music for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. The previous research focused on André Mathieu who was born in Canada, not France, which doesn't match the TASK criteria. Search for other composers associated with the 1976 Montreal Olympics who might have French origins and Pioneer Pictures connections, including any secondary composers, arrangers, or musicians involved in the Olympic ceremonies who had film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Film historian automating the identification of French-born composers with Pioneer Pictures ties in 1976 Montreal Olympic ceremony archives for a documentary soundtrack licensing project
- Music licensing agency streamlining due diligence by extracting composer names, nationality indicators, and studio affiliations from web search JSON to assess rights acquisition for Olympic-themed compilations
- Academic musicologist conducting large-scale analysis of composer migration patterns by filtering search results for French composers involved in major film studios and sports events between 1970–1980
- Data journalism team investigating historical studio support for Olympic ceremonies by analyzing JSON search outputs to uncover hidden connections between Pioneer Pictures and event composers
- Entertainment intelligence analyst tracking competitor composer affiliations by monitoring search engine mentions and automatic extraction of nationality, studio, and event metadata from search result data
- Cultural heritage NGO curating an interactive online exhibition on Olympic music using automated parsing of web search data to catalog French composers’ contributions to Montréal 1976 ceremonies
- QA engineer validating JSON extraction pipelines in a music metadata API by testing keyword filtering, relevance scoring, and reporting logic on sample Olympic composer search results
- Marketing strategist mapping influencer-composer profiles by extracting biographical and event participation data from search result JSON to inform targeted sponsorship campaigns
