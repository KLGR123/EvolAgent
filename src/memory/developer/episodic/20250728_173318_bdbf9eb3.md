### Development Step 1: Determine number of Transformer encoder layers in “Attention Is All You Need” paper

**Description**: Search for the original 'Attention is All You Need' paper to identify the number of encoder layers in the Transformer architecture. Use these search approaches: (1) Search for the paper title 'Attention is All You Need' on Google Scholar or arXiv, (2) Look for the official paper PDF which should be available on arXiv, (3) Extract the architecture details specifically focusing on the encoder structure and number of layers/blocks mentioned in the model description.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic research automation for meta-analyses: programmatically retrieve the original “Attention is All You Need” paper to extract encoder layer counts and integrate them into systematic literature reviews.
- ML engineering validation pipeline: automatically fetch and verify Transformer encoder configurations from arXiv before deploying new model variants in production.
- AI startup documentation generator: scrape authoritative Transformer architecture details (e.g., number of encoder layers) to auto-populate design docs and architecture diagrams.
- University library metadata enrichment: catalog and tag neural network publications by extracting specific model specs (encoder blocks) from arXiv PDFs for an academic repository.
- Curriculum development for AI courses: pull the official paper PDF and parse out the encoder layer information to generate accurate lecture slides and course materials.
- Compliance auditing in AI ethics review: cross-reference published Transformer architectures by automatically fetching encoder layer details to ensure transparency in white papers and regulatory filings.
- Competitive intelligence dashboard: aggregate specifications of foundational models by programmatically searching for “Attention is All You Need” on Google Scholar and arXiv to compare encoder depths across implementations.
