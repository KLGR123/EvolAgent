### Development Step 5: Identify Indiana’s First Governor and When Legislature Named 23.6-Mile I-65 Section in 1783 County

**Description**: Research Indiana's first governor to identify who this person was, then search for information about a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 that was named in their honor. Focus on finding when the Indiana legislative body passed the resolution to designate this highway section. Additionally, identify which Indiana county was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 to determine the specific location of this Interstate 65 section.

**Use Cases**:
- State DOT automates highway naming verification and legislative resolution tracking for updating official signage and maps
- Local historical society generates digital exhibits on Indiana’s first governor and memorial highway dedications through structured data extraction
- GIS team integrates parsed county establishment history and interstate segment metadata into spatial databases for infrastructure planning
- K–12 curriculum developers build interactive timelines of Indiana statehood, county formation, and road dedications using compiled research findings
- Government legal advisors audit legislative resolution dates and sponsors to ensure compliance in naming rights and commemorative designations
- Regional tourism bureau designs heritage driving tours by combining governor biographies and memorial highway information from automated analysis
- Data journalists craft interactive web stories on Jonathan Jennings and Interstate 65 developments using enriched historical and legislative data
- Archives managers enrich digital collections with linked metadata on colonial county origins, gubernatorial history, and highway memorialization
