### Development Step 18: Compile US Presidents’ Birth Cities, States, and Coordinates into JSON File

**Description**: Collect a complete list of all United States presidents with their official birth city names and state names, then obtain the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) for each birth city using authoritative sources such as official presidential biographies or Wikipedia infoboxes. Save the results in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON) at workspace/presidential_birthplaces.json.

**Use Cases**:
- K–12 interactive mapping tool integrating presidential birthplace data to teach US history in virtual classroom settings
- Tourism itinerary planner for history enthusiasts generating road-trip routes to visit all US presidents’ birthplaces
- Museum exhibit software producing geospatial timelines of presidents for digital kiosks and immersive installations
- Political geography research platform analyzing regional patterns in presidents’ birth cities for academic publications
- Civic engagement portal enabling local governments to visualize and promote hometown ties to former presidents
- Mobile AR app creating location-based presidential trivia experiences using birth city coordinates in city tours
- News media interactive infographics mapping presidents’ birthplaces for web articles and broadcast segments
- Real estate marketing analytics highlighting historical significance of neighborhoods by listing nearby presidents’ birth cities
