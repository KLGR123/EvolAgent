### Development Step 4: Identify ‘Sacred Desire’ protagonist: former Soviet paratrooper co-founder and 1992 crackdown details

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the book 'Sacred Desire' and its protagonist, focusing on finding information about a former Soviet paratrooper who co-founded an organization and fled due to a 1992 crackdown. Search for keywords including 'Sacred Desire book protagonist Soviet paratrooper', 'Sacred Desire novel former Soviet paratrooper co-founder', '1992 crackdown organization Soviet paratrooper fled', and 'Sacred Desire character co-founded organization 1992'. Extract details about the protagonist's identity, the organization they co-founded, and the circumstances of the 1992 crackdown.

**Use Cases**:
- Investigative journalism fact-checking to reveal the identity and history of a novel’s underground movement co-founder who fled a 1992 crackdown, using multi-engine targeted searches and relevance scoring
- Corporate compliance due-diligence automating background checks on executives by querying Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, and Brave to uncover undisclosed co-founding roles and sanction risks
- Academic literature review on post-Soviet military memoirs employing DDGS-powered searches to extract and prioritize books featuring former Soviet paratroopers as protagonists
- Publisher acquisition scouting for obscure or untranslated fiction matching specific plot elements (e.g., a paratrooper fleeing a 1992 crackdown), filtering candidate manuscripts by scored relevance
- Human rights monitoring to track online reports of political repression, automatically flagging any mention of paratrooper-led organizations and historic crackdowns for situational awareness
- Intellectual property prior art search for fictional works about ex-military figures and clandestine groups, leveraging multi-backend queries and heuristic scoring to identify potential conflicts
- Market intelligence gathering on niche military-themed novels, using targeted queries and relevance indicators (paratrooper, co-founder, crackdown) to inform new gaming or publishing product development
