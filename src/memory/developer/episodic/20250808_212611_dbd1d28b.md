### Development Step 1: Identify 2020 Documentary, Director, Featuring ‘Run Home Slow’ 1963 Soundtrack Composer

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the 2020 documentary that includes archival footage from the 1960s and focuses on a composer who wrote the soundtrack for the 1963 B movie 'Run Home Slow'. Search for keywords including '2020 documentary archival footage 1960s composer', 'Run Home Slow 1963 B movie soundtrack composer', 'documentary 2020 composer 1960s footage', and 'Run Home Slow soundtrack who composed'. Focus on identifying both the specific 2020 documentary title and the composer it focuses on, as well as the director of this documentary.

**Use Cases**:
- Archival film researcher verifying the composer and director details of a 1963 B-movie soundtrack for a museum retrospective
- Music licensing manager tracing rights holders of obscure 1960s film scores to secure streaming permissions
- Documentary producer sourcing background on a mid-century composer and archival footage for a new film project
- University film studies professor compiling a case study on 1960s B-movies and their music for a lecture series
- Film festival curator contextualizing archival materials and composer profiles in a 2020 retrospective lineup
- Legal team for a media company confirming public domain status of a 1963 soundtrack before re-release
- Digital archivist enriching metadata in an online film repository with documentary titles, composers, and directors
- Independent journalist researching forgotten film composers and their documentaries for a published feature article
