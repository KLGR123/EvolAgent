### Development Step 36: Identify First Australian Notts County Manager or Aussie Managers With English Clubs’ Italian Kit Connections

**Description**: Search for information about which Australian football manager was the first to manage Notts County specifically, or alternatively search for any Australian managers who have managed English clubs with historical Italian kit connections. Focus on finding if there's a different Australian manager than Harry Kewell who managed an English club that actually sent replica kits to Italian clubs. Search for keywords including 'Australian manager Notts County', 'first Australian football manager Italian kit connection', 'Australian coach English club Juventus connection', and 'Notts County Australian manager history'.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports journalism fact-checking and automated report generation for articles on managerial milestones: verifying Harry Kewell as the first Australian to manage Notts County and compiling evidence for publication
- Football club heritage marketing and merchandise design inspiration: leveraging the Notts County–Juventus historical kit connection when launching a special-edition black-and-white jersey
- Academic sports history research and cross-cultural analysis of football influences: studying how Notts County’s kit inspired Juventus for a peer-reviewed journal article
- Automated sports data integration and content publishing for fan mobile apps: ingesting manager appointment dates and club trivia into an interactive timeline feature
- Documentary production pre-interview research and evidence compilation: gathering authoritative sources on Harry Kewell’s coaching career for a football history documentary
- Club official website historical section update and content synchronization: generating JSON and text reports to dynamically populate timelines of managerial appointments and kit heritage
- Sports analytics tool enhancement and milestone notification: alerting subscribers when national records are set or matched, such as the first Australian managing an English professional side
- Sponsorship proposal development and brand storytelling: incorporating the Notts County–Juventus kit origin story in presentations to prospective Italian investors and partners
