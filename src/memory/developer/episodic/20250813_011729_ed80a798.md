### Development Step 16: Find Harriet Martineau‚Äôs 1877‚Äì78 four-volume analysis of European peace ending 1846 including 1840 London Convention

**Description**: Search for books authored by Harriet Martineau that analyze a period of European peace ending in 1846 and include the Convention of London 1840 which resolved the Egyptian-Ottoman crisis. Focus on identifying her historical work that covers this specific timeframe and diplomatic event, then determine which publisher issued a four-volume edition of this work in 1877-1878. Search using keywords including 'Harriet Martineau European peace 1846', 'Convention of London 1840 Egyptian-Ottoman crisis', 'Martineau four-volume edition 1877-1878', and 'Harriet Martineau historical works publisher'.

**Use Cases**:
- Diplomatic history dissertation bibliography compilation: An academic researcher in European diplomatic history employs the automated search pipeline to locate Harriet Martineau‚Äôs volumes on the 1840 Convention of London, verifying publisher details for accurate citation in a PhD thesis.
- Digital humanities metadata enrichment for library collections: A university library uses the JSON and HTML parsing script to fill missing publisher information across scanned 19th-century texts, ensuring comprehensive metadata for their online catalog of historical works.
- Antiquarian bookseller inventory validation: A rare books dealer integrates the scraping tool into their inventory system to confirm edition dates and publishers of Victorian-era multi-volume histories, improving accuracy in catalog listings and provenance records.
- Government treaty archive verification: A national archives department applies the automated analysis approach to cross-reference treaty publications, verifying publishers like George Bell & Sons for records on the Egyptian‚ÄìOttoman crisis resolution.
- Publishing market competitor analysis: A market intelligence team at a publishing house runs the web search and metadata extraction workflow to map which houses released multi-volume historical works in the late 19th century, guiding decisions on new academic reprint series.
- Digital repository ingest automation: A digital repository manager leverages the code to automate ingestion of book metadata from Google Books API and web results, streamlining the creation of complete bibliographic entries for 19th-century historical collections.
- Museum exhibition catalog research: A museum curator uses the tool to verify publisher and edition details of multi-volume historical texts in the museum‚Äôs collection, ensuring the exhibition catalog accurately credits George Bell & Sons for Victorian publications.
- Genealogy database sourcing: A genealogical society research team employs the automated search procedure to identify and authenticate publisher information for historical narrative volumes cited in family histories, strengthening source credibility.
