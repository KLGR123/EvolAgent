### Development Step 12: Count of Nature Journal Peer-Reviewed Research Articles Published in 2020

**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Use Cases**:
- Pharmaceutical R&D portfolio reporting: automatically extracting and counting peer-reviewed clinical trial articles published in 2020 from major journal archives to track pipeline progress
- Banking compliance audit: parsing financial regulator websites to tally mandatory circulars and exclude advisory notices, generating compliance metrics for internal audit teams
- IT vulnerability management: scanning vendor release‚Äênote archives to count security patch announcements issued over the past year, supporting risk assessment dashboards
- Government transparency portal: aggregating and counting policy white papers published by various ministries in 2020‚Äîexcluding opinion pieces‚Äîfor public data visualizations
- Tech product performance tracking: extracting performance benchmark reports from corporate blog archives to quantify improvements across hardware releases
- Nonprofit impact reporting: mining donor-facing portals to count grant award announcements in 2020 while filtering out event news for annual impact statements
- Academic department benchmarking: collecting research article counts by discipline from university publication records to support annual faculty performance reviews
