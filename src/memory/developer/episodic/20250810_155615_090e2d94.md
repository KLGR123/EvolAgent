### Development Step 1: Identify French Lock System Designer in de Lesseps’ Abandoned 1880s Panama Canal Project

**Description**: Research the Panama Canal Project that was abandoned in the 1880s to identify who designed the lock system for this project. Focus on finding information about the French Panama Canal attempt led by Ferdinand de Lesseps, which was abandoned in 1889, and identify the specific engineer who designed the lock system. Search for keywords including 'Panama Canal 1880s abandoned project lock system designer', 'French Panama Canal engineer lock design', 'Ferdinand de Lesseps Panama Canal lock system', and 'Panama Canal original lock designer 1880s'.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical engineering analysis for civil engineering departments to integrate case studies of the French Panama Canal lock system in advanced hydraulics coursework
- Archive digitization for a museum’s interactive exhibit on 19th-century canal projects, leveraging compiled JSON research files for multimedia content
- Comparative research for documentary filmmakers creating a series on Ferdinand de Lesseps and Gustave Eiffel’s engineering legacies, using automated search and analysis
- Academic publishing support for historians writing a peer-reviewed paper on the evolution of lock designs, enabling rapid collation of primary sources and verification via SerpAPI
- Corporate training module development for infrastructure firms analyzing past project failures, using the plan’s code to generate lessons on risk factors and design pivots
- Grant proposal preparation for a research fund studying colonial-era engineering challenges, employing automated data extraction and contextual analysis of the Panama Canal attempt
- Digital archiving for engineering heritage organizations to build a searchable repository of lock system designs, with machine-readable JSON outputs for public access
