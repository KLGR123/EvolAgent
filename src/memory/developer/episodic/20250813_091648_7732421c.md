### Development Step 62: Identify Star Trek writer collaborating with Dustin Nguyen on symbiotic comics, linking to Jeff Lemire

**Description**: Search for specific information about Dustin Nguyen's Star Trek comic work to identify which writer he collaborates with on Star Trek projects, particularly focusing on any comics that feature symbiotic relationships, researcher protagonists, or science expeditions. Cross-reference this with the Star Trek Aliens series criteria to find the exact writer-artist collaboration that completes the chain: Star Trek writer ‚Üí Dustin Nguyen ‚Üí Jeff Lemire.

**Use Cases**:
- Supply chain audit for consumer electronics: automatically scan supplier invoices, manufacturer records, and distributor catalogs in a project workspace to trace the component origin chain (Tier 1 supplier ‚Üí OEM assembler ‚Üí retail partner) and flag compliance issues
- Academic co-authorship network mapping: ingest publication metadata from institutional repositories and CSV CVs, then analyze to reveal which lead biologist collaborates with which bioinformatics specialist on symbiosis research
- Pharmaceutical clinical trial collaboration analysis: aggregate trial registry JSON, parse principal investigator lists, and cross‚Äêreference with CRO partnership databases to identify the collaboration chain (PI ‚Üí data management team ‚Üí regulatory writer) in oncology drug submissions
- Film production credit tracing for visual effects: parse production schedule spreadsheets and studio credit JSON to isolate the chain (VFX supervisor ‚Üí lead artist ‚Üí cinematographer) on science-fiction expedition sequences for budgeting
- Cybersecurity vulnerability reporting pipeline: monitor bug tracker logs, load vulnerability JSON reports, and integrate manual threat intelligence notes to map the chain (security researcher ‚Üí vulnerability auditor ‚Üí patch developer) for zero-day exploits
- E-commerce influencer marketing attribution: scan campaign spreadsheets, parse engagement JSON from social platforms, and cross-reference with affiliate URLs to determine the chain (brand marketer ‚Üí influencer ‚Üí content writer) driving niche gadget sales
- Regulatory compliance documentation workflow: search policy text files, load compliance checklist JSON, and merge expert annotations to pinpoint the chain (compliance analyst ‚Üí document drafter ‚Üí legal approver) on environmental impact filings
