### Development Step 59: Extract gender-specific tertiary education completion data from 2011 Bulgarian Census PDF

**Description**: Extract the specific tertiary education completion data by gender from the downloaded Census2011final_en.pdf file in the workspace. Parse the document to locate the section containing tertiary education graduates by educational-qualification degree and sex, then extract the exact numbers of men and women who completed tertiary education according to the 2011 Bulgarian census.

**Use Cases**:
- Government education ministry generating gender-disaggregated tertiary graduation dashboards to inform national policy adjustments and budget allocations
- University research office automating extraction of male and female graduate counts for longitudinal studies on higher education enrollment trends
- Gender equality NGO compiling evidence-based reports on womenâ€™s participation in tertiary education to support EU funding grant applications
- Market intelligence team at an educational publisher analyzing regional male vs. female degree completion rates to tailor new textbook offerings
- Corporate HR analytics unit benchmarking workforce education levels against census-derived tertiary graduation figures by gender for diversity and inclusion initiatives
- Data journalism project visualizing disparities in tertiary attainment between men and women across Bulgarian provinces for an interactive news feature
- Statistical consultancy integrating census gender-specific tertiary education data into custom Python pipelines for client sector analyses
