### Development Step 44: Extract Survivor US Seasons 1–44 Winners into workspace JSON file

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Entertainment fan site content automation for a Survivor-focused blog that runs the scraper nightly to update its “Season Winners” page immediately after a finale.
- Data journalism trend analysis where reporters import the JSON into a BI tool to chart winner demographics and title patterns over 44 seasons for a feature article.
- Mobile trivia app backend that pulls the winners list to auto-generate questions (“Who won Season 23?”) and update its question bank with each new season.
- Academic media‐studies research pipeline integrating the extracted winners JSON with external datasets to examine diversity and social strategy evolution in reality TV outcomes.
- Voice assistant skill (e.g., Alexa/Google Home) that queries the local JSON file at runtime to answer user questions about Survivor winners on demand.
- Streaming platform chatbot integration using the winners list to provide accurate, real-time responses in live chat when users ask about past Survivor champions.
- Marketing campaign automation for a media network that reads the JSON to trigger promotional emails or social posts commemorating milestones (e.g., “10 years since Season 20 winner crowned”).
- DevOps monitoring workflow where a scheduled CI job runs the script and posts a Slack alert whenever the winners JSON is updated after a new season finale.
