**Description**: Conduct a web search for the book "World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries" (2017) edited by Marta Boni, focusing on Valentina Re's chapter or contribution. Look specifically for information about metalepsis, horror movies, dream worlds and reality in Valentina Re's work.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic systematic review automation for film studies researchers extracting structured metadata and chapter summaries on metalepsis in horror films
- Library metadata enrichment and cataloging automation for university libraries, auto-populating book records with ISBN, description, editor, chapter titles and author bios
- Course syllabus generation for media studies instructors, automatically compiling lecture notes and reading lists focused on dream worlds and reality in horror cinema
- Publishing fact-checking workflows for editorial teams, verifying book details, chapter content and sources before release
- Digital humanities research pipelines for building knowledge graphs around narrative techniques, integrating info about metalepsis, dream sequences, and reality in film
- Film and media analytics dashboards for cultural studies institutes, aggregating theoretical concepts like metalepsis across multiple sources for interactive exploration
- Teaching assistant chatbots for transmedia studies courses, dynamically retrieving and summarizing academic content on boundary transgressions in film narratives
- Automated literature mapping for grant proposals, visualizing connections between metalepsis, horror genres, and dream world studies for funding applications

This volume, situated at the crossroads of media studies, popular culture and literary criticism, explores the phenomenon of world building in all its richness and diversity, through case studies of cross- and transmedia franchises. The book brings together researchers from a variety of European countries and disciplines to offer an insight into the phenomenon of fictional and transmedia world building, approaching it from various theoretical and critical perspectives.",
