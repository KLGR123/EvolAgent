### Development Step 8: Identify 1983 Malko Competition Winner from East Germany and Extract “Claus”

**Description**: Analyze the extracted Malko Competition data from workspace files to identify the specific winner from East Germany and extract their first name. Focus on the 1983 winner Claus Peter who was identified as being from East Germany (a country that no longer exists). Verify this is the only recipient from the specified time period whose nationality corresponds to a defunct country, and extract the first name 'Claus' as the answer to the task.

**Use Cases**:
- Archival digitization for classical music foundations: Extracting and verifying the first names and nationalities (including defunct countries like East Germany) of competition winners from JSON to create searchable metadata.
- Museum exhibit content automation: Parsing historical award records to generate exhibit labels and digital displays with winners’ first names and accurate country statuses.
- Academic research on cultural diplomacy: Retrieving and classifying Malko Competition winners by nationality (including dissolved states) to analyze geopolitical trends in music awards.
- Government genealogy services: Extracting personal data from archival JSON, validating defunct nationalities, and isolating first names to enrich public records and family history databases.
- Publishing workflow for encyclopedia entries: Automating extraction of subject names and historical nationalities from raw JSON to populate digital encyclopedia and biographical pages.
- Business intelligence for record labels: Parsing musician competition data to track artist nationalities over time, including those from defunct states, for marketing analytics and catalog management.
- Academic library data migration: Cleaning and standardizing legacy JSON files by extracting key fields (names, countries) and updating defunct country labels in library catalogs.
- Automated quality control in data integration: Validating and extracting specific entries (e.g., the East German winner) from heterogeneous JSON sources to ensure data correctness before downstream analyses.
