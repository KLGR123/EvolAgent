### Development Step 1: Identifying Common Two-Word Customer Retention Models in Kashyap and Fader Studies (2018–2019)

**Description**: Conduct a focused academic literature search for research papers on customer retention studies published during 2018-2019 by authors Manash Pratim Kashyap and PS Fader. Use academic search engines like Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or academic databases. Focus the search on terms like 'Manash Pratim Kashyap customer retention 2018-2019' and 'PS Fader customer retention 2018-2019'. Extract information about the models used in their respective studies, looking specifically for any common two-word model type mentioned in both authors' works.

**Use Cases**:
- Marketing analytics teams aggregating customer retention model findings from 2018–2019 academic literature to optimize targeted campaign strategies
- Retail data science departments automating extraction of Pareto/NBD and Markov Model references from research papers to fine-tune loyalty program designs
- University research groups conducting systematic reviews of PS Fader’s Beta-Geometric/NBD model publications for advanced customer lifetime value coursework
- CRM software developers integrating a pipeline that discovers and updates recent retention algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Survival Model) to enhance platform capabilities
- Business consultants benchmarking customer churn prediction approaches by comparing Manash Pratim Kashyap’s and PS Fader’s model usage across peer-reviewed studies
- Data engineering teams building automated workflows to ingest, parse, and compare abstracts from Semantic Scholar and Google Scholar APIs for model selection frameworks
- Subscription-based SaaS companies monitoring academic advancements in churn prediction models to continuously refine in-house forecasting tools
- Financial services analysts synthesizing multi-author customer retention studies to validate and improve risk models for credit card churn prevention
