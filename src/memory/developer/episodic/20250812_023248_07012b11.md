### Development Step 23: Identify French-Origin Pioneer Pictures Composers for 1976 Montreal Olympics Theme Music

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements and search for alternative composers who both worked for Pioneer Pictures and composed theme music for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. The previous research focused on André Mathieu who was born in Canada, not France, which doesn't match the TASK criteria. Search for other composers associated with the 1976 Montreal Olympics who might have French origins and Pioneer Pictures connections, including any secondary composers, arrangers, or musicians involved in the Olympic ceremonies who had film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Journalistic fact-checking of claims linking a French-born composer to both Pioneer Pictures and the 1976 Montreal Olympics theme for an investigative article
- Academic musicology research cross-referencing digital archives to identify French composers with film industry ties and Olympic event contributions
- Film production due diligence automating the validation of composer credentials against studio affiliation and sports event participation data
- Cultural heritage cataloging of Olympic ceremony musicians and their film studio backgrounds for a museum’s interactive composer exhibit
- Human resources screening for a scoring role by scanning candidate bios against multi-criteria including nationality, studio work, and major event credits
- Legal IP rights assessment tracing composer-studio relationships and event contributions to resolve royalty distribution disputes
- Marketing analysis of brand partnerships by mapping composer associations between movie studios and Olympic sponsorship campaigns
