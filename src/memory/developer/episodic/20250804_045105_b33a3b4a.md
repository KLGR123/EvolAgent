### Development Step 58: Count Unique Survivor Winners from survivor_winners_list.json

**Description**: Count the number of distinct winner names in workspace/survivor_winners_list.json and report the unique Survivor winner count.

**Use Cases**:
- Automating a TV network’s content pipeline by counting unique Survivor champions from scraped JSON to update the official winners archive on their website
- Powering a subscriber newsletter for a streaming service that highlights how many distinct Survivor winners there have been across all seasons
- Enabling a market research team to track winner diversity over time by feeding the unique winner count into their demographic analysis dashboard
- Validating the integrity of scraped reality-show data in a data engineering workflow by comparing expected versus actual unique winner counts
- Generating question pools for a trivia mobile app by extracting and de-duplicating Survivor winner names to ensure each quiz uses fresh, unique options
- Assisting a media studies researcher in preparing an academic paper by providing a clean count of distinct Survivor champions for statistical reporting
- Driving a social media bot that posts “Did you know?” Survivor facts by automatically referencing the latest number of unique winners
- Feeding a visualization tool that creates word clouds of Survivor winner names, ensuring only one instance of each champion appears in the graphic
