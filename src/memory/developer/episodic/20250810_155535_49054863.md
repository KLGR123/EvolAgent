### Development Step 9: Identify Victorian-Era Surrey Lodge Developer Organization and Founder’s Birth Year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical building preservation and grant applications: heritage officers extract the original development organization and founder birth year to support funding proposals for Victorian-era restorations
- Real estate due diligence for acquisition teams verifying the lineage of Surrey Lodge–type properties by identifying the developer company and the founder’s biographical details
- Academic research on Victorian architecture where scholars automate extraction of developer organizations and founders’ birth years for inclusion in journal articles
- Museum exhibit curation: teams generate accurate founder biographies and organizational histories for display placards and interactive kiosks in heritage property exhibits
- Digital archive management in cultural institutions, indexing structured metadata about historic sites – including development organizations and founders’ birthdates – for searchable catalogs
- Legal title dispute resolution in law firms, using automated data analysis to confirm historical ownership chain by identifying the founding organization and founder details
- Urban planning departments updating GIS heritage overlays with precise development organization names and founder birth years to inform conservation zoning decisions
