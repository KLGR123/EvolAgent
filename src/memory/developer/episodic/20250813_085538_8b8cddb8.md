### Development Step 9: Identify Illustrator of ‘Little Monsters’ Comic Book and Their Writer Collaborations

**Description**: Search for information about the comic book 'Little Monsters' to identify its illustrator/artist. Focus on finding the artist who illustrated this comic and any information about their collaborations with writers. Look for official publication details, creator credits, and any collaborative relationships mentioned in connection with this work.

**Use Cases**:
- Publishing house due diligence: automating extraction of artist and writer credits from web search results for indie titles like “Little Monsters” to validate licensing agreements and royalty splits
- Digital library metadata enrichment: scraping publisher and retailer web pages to populate illustrator, writer, and publication details for graphic novels in a library catalog
- Academic comics research: compiling collaboration networks between artists and writers in horror graphic novels by parsing online articles, interviews, and publisher sites for creator credits
- Fan-run encyclopedia updates: automatically crawling search engine results and saved HTML pages to verify and update illustrator information for comic entries on a volunteer wiki
- Entertainment law compliance: performing targeted web searches and regex-driven parsing to confirm all credited artists on a graphic novel are correctly listed for contract and copyright reviews
- Marketing analytics for a comic distributor: scanning press releases, reviews, and retailer pages to extract illustrator names and mentions for social media campaigns and influencer outreach
- E-commerce product data automation: harvesting artist, writer, and publisher metadata from multiple online sources to enrich product listings for graphic novel sales platforms
- Publishing audit and archive correction: batch-processing saved search results and HTML files to identify missing or inconsistent creator credits in back-catalog editions before reprinting
