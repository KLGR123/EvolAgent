### Development Step 28: Identify Lyon’s French Department: Administrative Location for Leo Arnaud’s Birthplace (Rhône)

**Description**: Search for information about Leo Arnaud's birthplace in Lyon, France, to identify the specific French department where Lyon is located. Focus on finding geographical and administrative details about Lyon's location within France's departmental system. Search for keywords including 'Lyon France department administrative division', 'Lyon located which French department', 'Rhône department Lyon France', and 'Lyon geographical location French administrative regions'.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogical and musicology research automation for verifying composer Leo Arnaud’s birthplace department and ensuring accurate archival records
- Geographic information system (GIS) enrichment by extracting Lyon’s Rhône department details for precision mapping and regional analysis
- Travel app content localization that dynamically identifies Lyon’s departmental jurisdiction to tailor recommendations and local advisories
- Automated fact-checking for digital encyclopedias, cross-referencing multi-engine search results to confirm Lyon’s administrative division
- Academic administrative geography study tool that aggregates French departmental data (e.g., Rhône) for university coursework and publications
- Cultural heritage archiving for museums, validating Lyon-born artist profiles with correct department and prefecture information
- Legal and compliance auditing for event planners, verifying departmental regulations and permit requirements within the Rhône department
- Tourism itinerary optimization software that sources department-level points of interest and administrative boundaries around Lyon for guided tours
