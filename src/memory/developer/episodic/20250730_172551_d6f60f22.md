### Development Step 28: Cities of Westernmost (Santa Clara University) and Easternmost (UMass Boston) Universities

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- Interstate freight route planning for logistics companies optimizing delivery schedules between Santa Clara and Boston campus distribution centers
- Comparative climatology research measuring temperature and precipitation variation at the westernmost (Santa Clara) and easternmost (Boston) university locations
- Automated geofencing and alerting system monitoring traffic congestion or severe weather events around Santa Clara and Boston campuses
- Targeted alumni fundraising campaign segmenting supporters at the coastal extremes of the university network (Santa Clara vs. Boston)
- Cloud server provisioning strategy selecting data center endpoints closest to Santa Clara and Boston for minimum latency connections
- Multi-city educational campus tour planner generating itineraries that start in Santa Clara and conclude in Boston
- Student housing investment analysis comparing rental market trends near the westernmost and easternmost university sites
- Academic telehealth access study evaluating healthcare service availability in Santa Clara and Boston university communities
