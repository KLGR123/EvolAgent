### Development Step 5: Compile Official Land Area Measurements for Washingtonâ€™s 39 County Seats

**Description**: Research and extract the land area data for all 39 Washington state county seats that were identified in the previous step. Use authoritative sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, official city websites, or government geographic databases to obtain the land area measurements for each county seat city. Focus on finding the official land area figures in square miles or square kilometers for accurate comparison.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban infrastructure planning in Washington state county seats, using precise land area data to design municipal water supply networks and street maintenance schedules
- Public health service optimization across Washington county seats, mapping clinic and vaccination center coverage by city square miles for equitable access
- Emergency management resource allocation for Washington county seats, leveraging land area measurements to position fire stations and disaster response teams efficiently
- Real estate investment analysis targeting Washington county seats, correlating land area figures with property values to identify growth opportunities
- Environmental impact assessments in Washington county seats, calculating per capita green space and planning urban park development based on city land area
- Transportation network design for Washington county seats, using area statistics to model bus routes, bike lanes, and traffic flow projections
- Retail site selection and market entry strategy for chains expanding into Washington county seats, comparing city land area and population density for optimal store placement
- Educational district boundary planning in Washington county seats, utilizing land area data to balance school catchment zones and capacity planning
