### Development Step 14: Gold Medalistsâ€™ Birth Countries at Cortina FIS Nordic World Ski Championships Without Finland or Norway

**Description**: Search for information about FIS Nordic World Ski Championships held in Cortina d'Ampezzo that did not include participants from Finland or Norway. Focus on identifying which specific year this championship took place, then find the complete list of gold medalists from that event. Extract the birth countries of all gold medalists to identify which country produced a gold medalist at this particular championship.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports federation historical data auditing and gold medalist country aggregation for sports historians
- Compliance monitoring of supplier certification records and extraction of approved vendor countries in manufacturing supply chains
- Academic conference scheduling and presenter nationality analysis to ensure diverse representation among speakers
- Financial fraud detection by analyzing transaction logs, filtering out domestic transfers, and identifying foreign-origin flagged payments
- IT security analysis of access logs, isolating failed login entries from non-whitelisted IP addresses and summarizing top suspicious sources
- HR talent acquisition analytics by processing applicant JSON profiles, excluding internal referrals, and listing countries of external candidates
- Clinical trial participant demography reporting by loading trial result JSONs, removing anonymized entries, and aggregating participant home countries
- Media monitoring for political coverage analysis by loading debate transcript JSONs, extracting speaker segments without moderator interjections, and summarizing candidate speaking times by region
