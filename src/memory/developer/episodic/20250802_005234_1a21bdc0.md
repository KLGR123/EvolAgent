### Development Step 4: Assessing Sea Access of 13 Asian Monarchies Identified in 2021

**Description**: Research the coastal geography and sea access status for each of the 13 Asian monarchies identified in 2021. Determine which of these monarchical countries have direct access to seas, oceans, or other major water bodies by examining their geographic boundaries, coastlines, and maritime borders. Cross-reference this information with the previously identified list of Asian monarchies to count how many countries satisfy both criteria: having a monarchy AND having sea access.

**Use Cases**:
- Logistics route optimization and automated port selection for shipping companies navigating Asian monarchies with coastal access
- Investment feasibility assessment and site analysis for beachfront resort development in Southeast Asian monarchies
- Marine border security planning and patrol scheduling for defense ministries of monarchical states with sea borders
- Environmental impact modeling and marine conservation strategy design for coral reef protection off coastal monarchies
- Historical geography research and academic mapping of coastline shifts in Asian monarchies over the last century
- Insurance underwriting risk analysis for storm surge and flood exposure at port cities in monarchical countries
- Government infrastructure project prioritization and budget allocation for modernizing ports in sea-access monarchies
- Tourism itinerary automation and cruise route design for travel agencies targeting coastal excursions in monarchies
