### Development Step 36: Extract Survivor Seasons 1–44 Winner Names from Wikipedia into JSON File

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated update of a TV fan mobile app’s “Survivor Winners” section, ensuring the latest season winners are always current without manual edits
- Entertainment journalism data feed for blogs to generate infographics on winner demographics and trends across all 44 seasons
- Academic social science research pipeline extracting reality‐TV winner data to analyze gender and age representation changes over time
- Marketing team dashboard integration that tracks Survivor winner names for scheduling anniversary social-media posts and promotional campaigns
- Trivia game backend data refresh, pulling season‐winner pairs to keep quiz questions accurate and avoid hard-coding outdated facts
- Streaming service content recommendation engine ingesting reality-show winner info to personalize suggestions based on popular champion profiles
- Machine learning model training dataset creation, compiling past Survivor winners to predict future season outcomes based on historical patterns
