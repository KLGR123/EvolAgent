### Development Step 17: Determine Final Country from 1941 Cortina d‚ÄôAmpezzo Nordic Ski Championships Gold Medalists

**Description**: Analyze the research findings from the previous investigation to determine which specific country should be the final answer. The developer found that both Italy and Finland produced gold medalists at the 1941 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Cortina d'Ampezzo (which had minimal Finland/Norway participation). Review the detailed medal results and determine if there are any constraints or additional context that would help identify the single country name that answers the TASK question.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical sports federation analytics for automatically compiling country-wise gold medal summaries in Nordic skiing archives
- Automated sports news generation for online platforms, including medal counts, host country context, and tiebreaker explanations
- Academic research on wartime athletics, evaluating host-nation performance and minimal participation bias in 1941 championships
- National sports ministry decision support to allocate winter‚Äêsports funding based on detailed medal count analysis and host advantage
- Interactive museum exhibit backend powering live medal‚Äêtable displays and ‚Äúhost country champion‚Äù highlights for visitors
- Broadcast graphics automation for TV coverage, generating real‚Äêtime leaderboards and country rankings during skiing events
- Corporate sponsorship planning tool analyzing historical gold medal success to guide investment in winter‚Äêsports partnerships
- Data science education case study using JSON medal data processing and decision‚Äêmaking logic in hands‚Äêon student projects
