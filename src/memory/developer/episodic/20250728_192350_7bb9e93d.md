### Development Step 4: 1977 New York Yankees Walk Totals and At-Bats: Top Walk Leader Identification

**Description**: Search for comprehensive 1977 New York Yankees regular season statistics focusing on individual player walk totals. Target these information sources: (1) Official MLB statistics databases or archives, (2) Baseball-Reference.com historical data for 1977 Yankees roster, (3) Sports statistics websites with detailed seasonal breakdowns, (4) Historical baseball records covering individual player performance metrics. Extract complete batting statistics including walks (BB) and at-bats (AB) for all Yankees players during the 1977 regular season. Identify the player with the highest walk total and record their corresponding at-bat count for verification.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated sports analytics pipeline for a baseball statistics website that scrapes historical MLB table data, filters out summary rows, and ranks players by walk-to-at-bat ratios.
- Fantasy baseball app backend for generating custom leaderboards from Baseball-Reference tables by extracting individual player walk totals and at-bat counts while excluding aggregate team lines.
- Sports journalism workflow that automatically extracts, filters, and verifies player performance metrics from archived HTML tables to power weekly “On This Day in 1977 Yankees History” feature articles.
- Academic research project in sports economics that collects walk and at-bat data across seasons by scraping and cleaning historical baseball tables, ensuring only individual player entries are used for regression analysis.
- Sports betting model development where historical player walk rates and at-bat frequencies are programmatically scraped, cleaned, and ranked to serve as predictive features in machine learning algorithms.
- Museum or exhibit interactive display system that dynamically pulls, filters, and ranks 1977 Yankees player statistics from web archives to create player comparison dashboards for visitors.
- Financial data engineering scenario where quarterly earnings tables from corporate filings are scraped, summary rows excluded, and companies ranked by profit margins for investment analysis.
- Healthcare data aggregation tool that scrapes clinical trial outcome tables, filters out aggregate results, and ranks treatment arms by success rates to assist meta-analysts in systematic reviews.
