### Development Step 10: Identify Walk-Style-Nicknamed Player, 29 Steals in 1970, and the 1971 White Sox McCraw Trade

**Description**: Search for information about a baseball player who had an unusual walk style nickname, stole 29 bases in the 1970 season, and was involved in a trade between the Chicago White Sox and another team in 1971 where Tommy McCraw was exchanged. Focus on identifying this player's distinctive nickname related to his walking style, his 1970 season statistics showing exactly 29 stolen bases, and the specific 1971 trade details involving McCraw going to the team that had previously traded this player to the White Sox.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated sports journalism: scraping Baseball-Reference to enrich player profiles with nicknames, 1970 stolen base counts, and trade details for online articles
- Fantasy baseball analytics: pulling player stolen-base trends and team changes programmatically to update predictive lineup recommendations
- Sabermetric research: extracting career timelines and performance metrics (e.g., 29 SB in 1970) for statistical studies on player speed and value
- Historical database maintenance: verifying and updating baseball-player biographical records (walking-style nicknames, age, trades) in a sports archive
- Museum exhibit curation: gathering nickname origins and 1971 trade narratives to generate display panels for baseball history exhibits
- Sports contract analysis: compiling documented trade details and season stats to support agent negotiations and contract validations
- Academic case studies: creating datasets of 1970s player movements and performance for university courses in sports management
- Data-warehouse ingestion: automating the pipeline that scrapes, cleans, and loads player stats and transactions into a central analytics platform
