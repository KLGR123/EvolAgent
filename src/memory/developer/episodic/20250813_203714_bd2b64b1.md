### Development Step 4: Title:  
Identify US Survivor Winners Born in May Using Official Winner Lists and Birth Dates (Seasons 1–44)

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about US Survivor winners and their birth dates. Focus on finding official sources such as CBS Survivor databases, Wikipedia pages, or entertainment databases that list all winners from Season 1 through the most recent season available as of August 2023. Extract winner names, seasons, and birth dates to identify any winners born in May.

**Use Cases**:
- Entertainment journalism research for compiling birthday-themed Survivor winner features or trivia articles
- Automated data collection for fan websites maintaining up-to-date Survivor winner biographies and statistics
- Academic studies analyzing demographic trends and birth month patterns among reality TV competition winners
- Social media campaign planning for networks or brands to celebrate Survivor winners’ birthdays with targeted posts
- Television production teams preparing anniversary or reunion specials that highlight unique winner facts, such as shared birth months
- Data-driven marketing analysis to identify potential correlations between contestant backgrounds and show outcomes
