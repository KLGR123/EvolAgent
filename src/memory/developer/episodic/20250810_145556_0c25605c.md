### Development Step 14: Search Reliable Sources for Greg Chappell’s Death Date and Year

**Description**: Search for information about when Greg Chappell passed away. Focus on finding his death date and year, using search terms including 'Greg Chappell death date', 'Greg Chappell died year', 'Greg Chappell obituary', and 'Greg Chappell Australian cricketer death'. Verify the information from reliable sources such as cricket databases, news archives, or official cricket organizations.

**Use Cases**:
- National news agency automating extraction of high-profile obituary notices from incoming HTML webpage dumps to update breaking news feeds
- Genealogy research platform scanning digitized parish record HTML files for death dates to automatically enrich family tree databases
- Sports media analytics company crawling cricket history websites and pattern-matching for athlete death mentions to maintain up-to-date player status records
- Corporate compliance system parsing SEC filings and press release HTML for executive death announcements to trigger governance and succession alerts
- Academic digital humanities project processing 19th-century literary manuscripts converted to HTML to extract character or author death events and build historical timelines
- Life insurance underwriting platform automating verification of applicant mortality by parsing public obituaries and death notices in HTML from news archives
- Public health department analyzing online medical journal HTML articles for participant death reports to monitor clinical trial safety outcomes
- Market intelligence firm monitoring competitor executive changes by scanning corporate website HTML for obituary or “passed away” mentions in real time
