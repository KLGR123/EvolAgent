### Development Step 2: Parse PDF to Extract Seahorse Island Accommodation Types and Compare Their Average Ratings

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/67e8878b-5cef-4375-804e-e6291fdbe78a.pdf to extract information about all accommodations in Seahorse Island. Identify the different types of accommodations (such as hotels, motels, rental houses, campgrounds, etc.) and their corresponding ratings. Calculate the average rating for each accommodation type to determine which type has the highest average rating.

**Use Cases**:
- Tourism board of Seahorse Island uses automated PDF parsing to aggregate and compare average guest ratings of hotels, motels, rental houses, and campgrounds for their annual visitor satisfaction report.
- Hotel chain operations team extracts competitor ratings from public PDF brochures to benchmark performance across their various property types and pinpoint underperforming segments.
- Online travel agency automates extraction and analysis of PDF property review sheets to continuously update their website’s top-rated lodging categories based on up-to-date guest scores.
- Municipal parks department processes campground inspection PDF reports, categorizes sites (traditional campsite, glamping, RV hookup), and calculates average safety and satisfaction ratings for targeted maintenance planning.
- Market research firm parses supplier PDF catalogs of electronics, classifies items into laptops, tablets, and accessories, then computes average customer review scores to advise retail buyers on the highest-rating segments.
- Real estate investment group analyzes PDF property assessment documents, classifies residential units (apartments, condos, single-family homes), and computes average condition ratings to guide acquisition and renovation priorities.
- Event planning agency automates parsing of venue PDF data sheets, categorizes spaces (ballroom, conference rooms, outdoor pavilions), and computes average attendee feedback ratings to recommend the best fit for corporate retreats.
