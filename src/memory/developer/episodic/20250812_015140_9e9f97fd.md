### Development Step 11: Find agreement forming Reform Party with federal system and South African ambassador to France

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the agreement between a South African political figure and the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party that led to the formation of the Reform Party and proposed a federal system and bill of rights. Focus on finding information about this specific political agreement, the parties involved, and identify who later served as South African ambassador to France. Search for keywords including 'Inkatha Freedom Party agreement Reform Party', 'South Africa federal system bill of rights agreement', 'South African ambassador France Reform Party', and 'IFP leader political agreement federal system'.

**Use Cases**:
- Digital historiography of South African political accords and automated summarization for academic researchers
- Archival investigative journalism on apartheid-era negotiations and diplomatic appointments for newsroom fact-check teams
- Policy analysis of federalism proposals and bill-of-rights frameworks for think-tank reports and comparative governance studies
- Legal comparative constitutional research and structured extraction of agreement clauses for law firm due-diligence memos
- Government archive digitization and metadata synthesis of ambassadorial records and historical agreements for public library catalogs
- Human rights advocacy on non-violent political reforms and bill-of-rights campaigns using automated evidence compilation for NGO briefing materials
- E-learning module development on South African history through programmatic ingestion of political declaration data and leader biographies
- Intelligence and security assessment of foreign political agreements and ambassador postings using automated web search and confidence scoring
