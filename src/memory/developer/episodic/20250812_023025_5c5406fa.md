### Development Step 16: Identify French-Origin Pioneer Pictures Composers Involved in 1976 Montreal Olympics Theme Music

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements and search for alternative composers who both worked for Pioneer Pictures and composed theme music for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. The previous research focused on André Mathieu who was born in Canada, not France, which doesn't match the TASK criteria. Search for other composers associated with the 1976 Montreal Olympics who might have French origins and Pioneer Pictures connections, including any secondary composers, arrangers, or musicians involved in the Olympic ceremonies who had film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Film archive metadata verification for correctly attributing French-born composers in 1970s Olympic ceremony footage
- Legal due diligence and rights clearance for licensing Pioneer Pictures film scores in international distribution
- Academic musicology research compiling a database of French composers involved in 1976 Montreal Olympics ceremonies
- Automated journalism workflow to gather composer biographies and studio connections for sports history articles
- Museum exhibit content curation enriching display labels with composer origins and film studio affiliations
- Documentary production metadata enrichment auto-extracting composer names, origins, and Pioneer Pictures links
- Intellectual property audit tool for verifying composer credits and contractual associations in sports event recordings
- Knowledge graph population for cultural heritage platforms linking Olympic ceremony music teams to French film industry figures
