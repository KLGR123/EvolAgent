### Development Step 4: Search LibreTexts Introductory Chemistry (08/21/2023) by Alviar-Agnew 1.E Exercises for Equine Veterinarian

**Description**: Search for LibreText's Introductory Chemistry materials compiled on 08/21/2023 that are licensed by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew under the CK-12 license. Focus on locating the specific section '1.E Exercises' within these chemistry materials to identify the equine veterinarian mentioned there. Use search terms like 'LibreTexts Introductory Chemistry Marisa Alviar-Agnew Henry Agnew', 'CK-12 license chemistry materials 08/21/2023', and '1.E Exercises equine veterinarian' to find the relevant educational content.

**Use Cases**:
- K-12 curriculum developers automating the extraction of exemplar chemistry exercises and author metadata from open-license textbooks for seamless digital lesson plan integration
- University instructional designers verifying textbook section dates, licenses, and authorship to ensure compliance when embedding LibreTexts chapters into an online LMS
- Open educational resource librarians indexing historical practitioner references (e.g., equine veterinarians) within STEM materials to enrich institutional digital archives
- EdTech companies building AI tutoring bots by mining textbook examples and context snippets (like 1.E Exercises) under CK-12 license for interactive problem generation
- Non-profit grant officers auditing open-license content usage by extracting precise attributions and section details for funder compliance reports
- Research data analysts compiling domain-specific case studies (e.g., anthrax treatment by Louvrier) from educational resources to feed into a historical medical treatment database
- Quality assurance teams in educational publishing automating checks for author and license consistency across compiled textbook materials before re-distribution
