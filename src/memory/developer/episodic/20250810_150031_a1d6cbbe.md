### Development Step 29: Identify Australian captain during Arthur Morris‚Äô pre-1973-74 triple-century Test innings

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated sports history fact-checking for cricket statisticians verifying player milestone claims across archival web data
- Newsroom headline validation by journalists cross-referencing politician statements with indexed press release JSON feeds
- Regulatory compliance audit for financial institutions parsing quarterly report JSON disclosures to confirm adherence to reporting thresholds
- Academic literature review automation for researchers extracting and summarizing specific experimental results from JSON-formatted publication databases
- E-commerce price monitoring by product managers comparing competitor pricing details in scraped JSON catalogs to detect promotional discrepancies
- Legal discovery support for paralegal teams analyzing court transcript JSON exports to identify and flag references to key legal precedents
- Brand reputation management by marketing analysts scanning social media result JSONs for mentions of a company alongside sentiment and influencer credibility metrics
- Government policy tracking for public affairs specialists validating draft regulation content in JSON datasets to ensure consistency with legislative mandates
