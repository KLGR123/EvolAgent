### Development Step 10: Title:  
Identify the Word Deleted in Rule 701's Most Recent Amendment via LII's Amendment History Comparison

**Description**: Access Rule 701 (Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses) on Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website and examine its complete amendment history to identify the most recent amendment. Extract the specific text changes made in the last amendment to determine what word was deleted from the rule. Focus on comparing the before and after versions of the rule text to identify the exact word that was removed.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal research automation for law firms conducting amendment tracking and historical analysis of Federal Rules of Evidence for case preparation
- Compliance auditing by corporate legal departments to verify up-to-date application of Rule 701 in internal training materials and policies
- Academic research in legal studies to examine the evolution of evidentiary standards and the impact of specific word deletions on courtroom practices
- Judicial clerks or court staff automating the comparison of rule versions to support judges in interpreting the most current language of Rule 701
- Legal publishing companies updating annotated rulebooks and digital platforms by programmatically identifying and documenting text changes in federal rules
- Litigation support teams generating expert reports that highlight substantive versus stylistic amendments for use in motions or evidentiary hearings
