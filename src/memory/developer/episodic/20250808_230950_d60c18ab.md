### Development Step 3: Wikipedia 'Dragon' Page: Leap Day (Feb 29, 2000 & 2004) Edits Removing Jokes or Humor Content

**Description**: Search for Wikipedia revision history of the 'Dragon' page to identify edits made on leap days (February 29) before 2008. Focus on February 29, 2000 and February 29, 2004 as the only leap days in that timeframe. Look for edit summaries or revision comparisons that mention joke removal, humor deletion, or similar content changes. Extract the specific revision data showing what content was removed on those dates.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical Wikipedia content auditing to verify removal of informal or humorous material for compliance with encyclopedic standards
- Academic research into the evolution of Wikipedia article tone and editorial practices over time
- Automated detection and documentation of joke or prank edits in high-profile Wikipedia pages for digital humanities studies
- Quality assurance for Wikipedia administrators seeking to identify and review non-encyclopedic content edits on significant dates (e.g., leap days, anniversaries)
- Training dataset generation for machine learning models that classify humorous versus formal content in collaborative knowledge bases
- Media fact-checking to trace the origin and removal of viral or meme-like phrases from public knowledge resources
- Educational curriculum development illustrating the importance of editorial oversight and tone in open-source encyclopedias
- Archival preservation projects aiming to document the cultural history of online communities through notable content changes
