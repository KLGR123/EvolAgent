### Development Step 3: Extract and Format Ascending Comma-Delimited Page Numbers for Calculus Midterm Preparation

**Description**: Extract and format the page numbers from the completed audio analysis into the final comma-delimited list in ascending order as requested. Based on the developer's results showing the corrected page list [132, 133, 134, 197, 245, 1197], format this into the exact output format specified in the TASK: a comma-delimited list of page numbers in ascending order for the Calculus mid-term study preparation.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal deposition audio indexing and page reference generation for law firms preparing evidence portfolios
- Medical lecture audio analysis to extract slide and page numbers for building CME (Continuing Medical Education) study packets
- Corporate compliance training video transcript pagination to create quick-reference guides for HR and audit teams
- eLearning platform automated extraction of chapter and page markers from audio lectures for improved student navigation
- Research lab meeting audio recordings page-number tagging to streamline protocol reviews and experimental replication
- Publishing house quality assurance of audiobook pagination consistency by extracting and validating spoken page references
- Digital library archival of oral history interviews with page-based metadata extraction for enhanced search and retrieval
