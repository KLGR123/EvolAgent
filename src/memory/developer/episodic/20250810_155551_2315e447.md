### Development Step 10: Analyze Surrey Lodge research data to find its developer organization, founder, and founder’s birth year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical property due diligence: automatically scanning municipal archives and research outputs to identify the original developer company and founder’s birth year for real estate investment reports
- Heritage architecture exhibit curation: extracting organization background and founder biographical details from text and JSON research files to draft museum display panels on Victorian-era buildings
- Genealogy service enrichment: processing family history research data to pinpoint who established a family-run society or firm and retrieve their birth year for detailed lineage profiles
- Academic literature review automation: ingesting JSON and text summaries of historical studies to compile key metadata (organization, founder, development dates) for Victorian urban development theses
- Business intelligence reporting: analyzing competitor historical documentation to uncover the founding organization and its founder’s birth year for strategic market entry assessments
- Cultural heritage conservation planning: harvesting structured research and summary reports to connect heritage sites’ developers with individual founders, supporting grant applications and preservation bids
- Digital archive keyword analysis: performing targeted term counts in research datasets to map out focus areas (organization, founder, development) and generate concise summary reports for cultural resource management teams
