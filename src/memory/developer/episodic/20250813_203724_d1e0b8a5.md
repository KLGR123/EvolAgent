### Development Step 5: US Survivor Winners & Birth Dates (Season 1–Recent): Identify Winners Born in May Using Official Sources

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about US Survivor winners and their birth dates. Focus on finding official sources such as CBS Survivor databases, Wikipedia pages, or entertainment databases that list all winners from Season 1 through the most recent season available as of August 2023. Extract winner names, seasons, and birth dates to identify any winners born in May.

**Use Cases**:
- Entertainment journalism research for compiling birthday-themed Survivor winner features or articles
- Automated trivia database creation for fan websites, focusing on Survivor winners' birth months
- Social media campaign planning for CBS or Survivor fan pages to celebrate winners' birthdays in May
- Statistical analysis of Survivor winner demographics for academic studies on reality TV trends
- Personalized merchandise or event planning for Survivor conventions, highlighting May-born champions
- Automated birthday notification system for Survivor alumni networks or fan clubs
