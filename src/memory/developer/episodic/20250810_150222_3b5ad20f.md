### Development Step 35: Identify Australian captain during Arthur Morris‚Äôs pre-1973/74 300+ Test innings.

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports record verification and historical data analysis for cricket journalists fact-checking player achievements
- Legal precedent retrieval and clause validation for corporate compliance teams auditing contract accuracy
- Medical literature targeted search and claim verification for clinical researchers evaluating treatment efficacy
- Market intelligence extraction and competitor feature confirmation for product managers benchmarking new releases
- Academic thesis citation audit and statistical data validation for university libraries ensuring scholarly integrity
- Genealogy claim validation and archival record cross-referencing for family historians confirming ancestral stories
- Regulatory document auditing and citation cross-checking for financial institutions maintaining compliance standards
- Travel advisory information aggregation and destination fact-checking for tour operators preparing accurate guides
