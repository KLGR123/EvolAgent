### Development Step 4: Extract official land area figures for all 39 Washington state county seats

**Description**: Research and extract the land area data for all 39 Washington state county seats that were identified in the previous step. Use authoritative sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, official city websites, or government geographic databases to obtain the land area measurements for each county seat city. Focus on finding the official land area figures in square miles or square kilometers for accurate comparison.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban infrastructure planners automating the retrieval and land area comparison of all 39 Washington county seats to allocate road maintenance and public works budgets based on city size
- State emergency management teams compiling official square‐mile figures for each county seat to model floodplain extents and optimize evacuation zone mapping
- Regional real estate investment analysts integrating precise land area metrics for Washington county seats into competitive market reports and property valuation models
- Environmental consultants extracting city footprint data to assess cumulative land cover change and habitat impact for statewide conservation grant proposals
- Telecommunications engineers using official land area measurements of each county seat to design and simulate optimal cell tower placement and network coverage
- Academic geography instructors demonstrating hands‐on GIS data extraction and JSON/CSV inspection workflows with real‐world Washington county seat area figures
- State transportation authorities gathering accurate land area statistics to prioritize expansion of bike lanes and public transit corridors in larger county seats
- Local economic development agencies benchmarking city size across Washington’s county seats to tailor stimulus packages and business incentive zones accordingly
