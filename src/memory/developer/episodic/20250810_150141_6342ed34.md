### Development Step 33: Identify Australian captain in Arthur Morris‚Äôs pre-1973/74 Test 300+ innings

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated fact‚Äêchecking of cricket match databases to correct player performance records and prevent misattributions in sports archives
- Quality control pipeline for historical sports archives that identifies and rectifies errors in JSON‚Äêformatted cricket statistics
- Metadata extraction and structured analysis for sports analytics firms generating captaincy impact and innings breakdown reports
- Academic research support for cricket historians by parsing match data files and compiling evidence‚Äêbased performance summaries
- CI/CD integration to validate JSON schema consistency and detect data anomalies in cricket data repositories before production deployment
- Automated generation of audit trails and compliance documentation for digital sports archives under archival and record‚Äêkeeping standards
- Editorial verification workflow for sports journalism teams to rapidly confirm statistical claims and produce factually accurate articles
- Data governance automation for sports organizations tracking data lineage, error correction logs, and versioned analysis reports
