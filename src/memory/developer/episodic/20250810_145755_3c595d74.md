### Development Step 21: Arthur Morris‚Äôs Pre-1973 Test Triple-Century: Identify the Australian Captain

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports analytics verification of athlete records by parsing match statistics JSON to confirm individual milestones (e.g., validating a batsman‚Äôs 300+ scores and captain at the time)
- Financial audit automation that inspects transaction log JSON files to identify anomalies over specified thresholds and flag responsible account managers for investigation
- Academic literature review workflow extracting publication metadata (authors, citation counts, topics) from JSON search results to build curated reading lists for research proposals
- E-commerce price-tracking system analyzing competitor price feeds in JSON to detect price drops or spikes above set percentages and alert pricing teams for dynamic adjustments
- Legal discovery process parsing JSON outputs from document management systems to pinpoint case references, involved attorneys, and key clauses for rapid litigation preparation
- Healthcare compliance audit examining procedural log JSON data to track high-risk codes, provider names, and procedure durations, ensuring coding accuracy and regulatory adherence
- News fact-checking pipeline that processes JSON-formatted article scrapes to extract claims, named entities, and publication dates, supporting editorial teams in verifying story accuracy
- Real-estate portfolio monitoring parsing JSON property listing feeds to validate listing details against market benchmarks and flag mispriced assets for investor review
