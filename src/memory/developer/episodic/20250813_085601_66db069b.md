### Development Step 10: Identify Little Monsters Comic Illustrator and Their Collaborations with Writers

**Description**: Search for information about the comic book 'Little Monsters' to identify its illustrator/artist. Focus on finding the artist who illustrated this comic and any information about their collaborations with writers. Look for official publication details, creator credits, and any collaborative relationships mentioned in connection with this work.

**Use Cases**:
- Comic store chain consolidating artist credits from multiple online sources (ComicVine, MyComicShop, LeagueOfComicGeeks) to ensure accurate royalty calculations for Little Monsters
- University library digital archivist extracting illustrator metadata from archived HTML of indie comic titles to enrich catalog entries with correct artist attributions
- Intellectual property law firm verifying the official illustrator of Little Monsters in HTML search results to support licensing agreement negotiations
- Indie comic publisher automating validation of creator credits submitted via web-form HTML to streamline onboarding of new titles and ensure proper credit distribution
- Art historian analyzing collaboration networks by scraping artist and writer names from comic database HTML pages for a scholarly publication on comics partnerships
- Marketing team at a comic convention building an interactive exhibit by curating artist profiles and sample artwork for Little Monsters extracted from fan-site HTML
- Digital humanities researcher compiling a searchable database of comic-book creators by programmatically extracting structured metadata from HTML search results across multiple repositories
- E-commerce platform selling licensed comic art prints verifying and updating illustrator credits on product pages by scraping and cross-referencing HTML files from key comic databases
