### Development Step 1: Family Reunion Attendance Analysis and Potato Needs in 5-Pound Bags

**Description**: Systematically analyze the family reunion attendee list to determine the exact number of adults and children attending. Parse through each family group mentioned: (1) Your parents (married mother and father), (2) Your twin brother and his family (brother + spouse + 2 children), (3) Your aunt and her family (aunt + spouse + 1 six-year-old), (4) Your grandma and her brother, (5) Her brother's daughter and her family (daughter + spouse + 3 kids under 12), plus yourself. Account for the deceased members (grandpa and grandma's sister-in-law) and the special dietary restriction (second cousins don't eat carbs). Calculate total potato consumption using the given rates: 1.5 potatoes per adult, 0.5 potatoes per child (except carb-free second cousins), convert to pounds using 0.5 pounds per potato, and determine how many 5-pound bags are needed.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate retreat catering and side-dish provisioning for a multinational team with low-carb and child-friendly meal options
- Summer camp weekly meal planning and potato supply calculation for campers, counselors, and gluten-free participants
- Wedding reception menu and ingredient ordering automation accounting for adults, children, and guests with dietary restrictions
- School field trip lunch box assembly and snack pack distribution for students with allergen exclusions and teacher chaperones
- Hospital inpatient meal scheduling and tuber-based side dish forecasting across adult and pediatric wards with diabetic diet exclusions
- Military training camp mess hall resource forecasting and bulk potato ordering considering soldiers and trainees on low‐carb rations
- Non-profit community soup kitchen stock planning and vegetable procurement tailored to adult visitors, families, and carb-free volunteers
- Restaurant chain brunch service potato side dish inventory management and automated ordering report generation for multiple locations
