### Development Step 49: Investigate J.K. Woodward’s Collaborations with Jeff Lemire and Other Writers to Confirm Collaboration Chain

**Description**: Search for collaborative relationships between J.K. Woodward (the Star Trek Aliens artist) and Jeff Lemire to verify the connection in the collaboration chain. Also search for any other writers who have worked with J.K. Woodward on comics, as this may reveal the specific writer who collaborates with an artist who collaborates with Jeff Lemire. Focus on finding concrete evidence of Woodward's collaborations beyond the Star Trek work to establish the missing link in the chain: Star Trek writer → Artist (who collaborates with Lemire) → Jeff Lemire → Andrea Sorrentino.

**Use Cases**:
- Film production collaboration mapping using web-scraped credits (IMDb, studio sites) to link a cinematographer who worked with the director on one project to the editor on another, helping producers assemble teams with proven synergy.
- Academic co-authorship chain analysis by mining Google Scholar and university repositories to trace a graduate student’s publications through intermediate collaborators up to a Nobel-laureate researcher for grant application endorsements.
- Open-source contributor network verification via GitHub/GitLab API scraping to discover the chain linking a niche plugin developer to a core framework maintainer, facilitating targeted community outreach and recruitment.
- Music industry partnership discovery by extracting credits from Discogs and AllMusic to identify session musicians who connect an emerging artist to a high-profile producer for strategic collaboration pitches.
- Supply-chain vendor traceability through trade registry and customs database scraping to uncover indirect supplier relationships between a component manufacturer and a final assembly plant for compliance and risk audits.
- Pharmaceutical R&D partnership tracking by scraping ClinicalTrials.gov and press releases to map collaboration chains from a biotech startup researcher to a Big Pharma lead scientist, informing licensing negotiations.
- Political consultancy network intelligence by mining campaign finance filings and news archives to chart the advisory chain from a local campaign strategist to a national policy consultant for vetting potential hires.
- Legal expert witness relationship mapping by parsing court dockets and legal directory entries to establish the connection between a forensic analyst and a high-stakes litigation attorney for pretrial strategy development.
