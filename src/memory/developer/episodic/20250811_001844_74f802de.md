### Development Step 6: Title:  
Unscramble 100-Letter Anagram to Reveal Famous Hamlet Line from Shakespeare

**Description**: Solve the anagram by rearranging the letters from 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten' to find the original Shakespeare line from Hamlet that this phrase represents. Focus on identifying one of Shakespeare's most well-known lines from the tragedy, ensuring all 100 letters are used exactly once in the rearrangement.

**Use Cases**:
- Literary scholarship: Verifying the authenticity of Shakespearean quotes in academic papers by reconstructing original lines from complex anagrams.
- Puzzle and trivia game development: Automatically generating or solving Shakespeare-themed anagram challenges for educational apps or escape rooms.
- Digital humanities research: Analyzing and decoding historical ciphers or literary puzzles embedded in early modern texts using systematic anagram solving.
- Classroom teaching aids: Assisting English teachers in creating interactive lessons where students unscramble famous literary lines from jumbled phrases.
- Automated plagiarism detection: Identifying disguised or paraphrased Shakespeare quotes in student essays by matching anagrammed text to canonical sources.
- Archival restoration: Reconstructing damaged or fragmented manuscripts by piecing together original text from surviving letter sequences.
- AI-powered chatbot enrichment: Enabling conversational agents to solve or generate literary anagrams for engaging user interactions in educational platforms.
- Editorial fact-checking: Assisting publishers in verifying that quoted material in manuscripts or articles accurately reflects original Shakespearean text, even when presented as anagrams.
