### Development Step 13: Year and Gold Medalists‚Äô Birth Countries at Cortina FIS Nordic Worlds Excluding Finland/Norway

**Description**: Search for information about FIS Nordic World Ski Championships held in Cortina d'Ampezzo that did not include participants from Finland or Norway. Focus on identifying which specific year this championship took place, then find the complete list of gold medalists from that event. Extract the birth countries of all gold medalists to identify which country produced a gold medalist at this particular championship.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports history research: automating the extraction of medalist countries from the 1941 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships without Finland or Norway participation to support a historian‚Äôs monograph on underrepresented winter events
- Data journalism workflow: generating a concise list of gold‚Äêmedal‚Äìproducing countries from niche championships to publish an article highlighting overlooked national athletes
- National ski federation analysis: auditing historical championships with minimal Nordic involvement to identify growth opportunities for emerging ski programs in Italy and neighboring regions
- Sports analytics platform integration: ingesting JSON‚Äêformatted event results to feed predictive models assessing medal distribution when traditional powerhouses are absent
- Educational content development: compiling country medal summaries from mid-20th century ski championships to create interactive modules for a digital sports history course
- Archival data quality control: validating participation metadata (e.g., Finland/Norway mentions) in a sports archive‚Äôs ETL pipeline to flag inconsistencies and ensure accuracy
- Event organizing committee benchmarking: analyzing past world championships without major-country participation to inform risk assessments and participant outreach strategies for future venues in Alpine regions
