### Development Step 1: Identify Band Behind Self-Funded $1500 Three-Day Recording Session of Four Songs and Prince Side Project

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the musical group that recorded the songs 'Lord_Grunge,' 'Raped,' 'Weird_On_The_Avenue,' and 'I_Only_Play_4_Money' during a three-day recording session with $1500 self-funding. Focus on finding information about this specific recording session, the band members involved, and any connections to The_Family_(band) which was a Prince side project. Search for terms like 'Lord Grunge Raped Weird On The Avenue I Only Play 4 Money band', 'three day recording session $1500 self-funded', 'The Family band Prince side project keyboardist', and combinations of these song titles with recording session details.

**Use Cases**:
- Independent musicologist curating an online discography uses automated multi-engine searches to identify band names, recording session details, and funding information for obscure demo tracks discovered in a private vinyl collection
- IP attorney conducting trademark clearance for a new product line runs systematic queries across Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, and niche search engines to detect prior art and existing registrations matching proposed brand names and slogans
- Digital archivist digitizing a cache of 1990s demo tapes leverages comprehensive search automation to recover missing metadata‚Äîartist rosters, recording dates, self-funding details, and side-project links‚Äîfor precise catalog entries
- Marketing analyst performing competitor feature mapping executes targeted searches combining product feature keywords and launch event terms across multiple backends, then ranks and summarizes results to inform a product positioning report
- Compliance officer monitoring online content for policy violations automates searches for flagged terms (e.g., hate speech, defamation) across a range of platforms, scoring and categorizing findings to streamline enforcement workflows
- Research librarian automating academic literature reviews employs broad and specialized query patterns across search engines and academic portals to retrieve, score, and summarize relevant papers for systematic review inclusion
- Investigative journalist fact-checking a viral rumor uses scripted search variants spanning key phrases and context terms to trace the story‚Äôs origin, identify credible sources, and quantify consistency of reports across websites
- Sales intelligence team automates prospect discovery by searching for companies that mention specific revenue figures, funding rounds, and technology stack keywords, aggregating and ranking leads by relevance for targeted outreach
