### Development Step 46: Search for and download University of Leicester dragon diet fish supply paper PDF

**Description**: Conduct a web search for the University of Leicester paper titled "Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?" and download the full PDF of that paper into workspace/dragon_diet_fish_bag.pdf.

**Use Cases**:
- Automating retrieval of full-text regulatory filings (e.g., SEC annual reports) from corporate websites for financial compliance teams
- Bulk-downloading environmental impact assessment PDFs from university repositories to support sustainability consulting projects
- Legal due diligence workflows that harvest court opinions and legal memoranda in PDF for law firms preparing complex litigation cases
- Academic researchers mass-collecting neuroscience journal articles in PDF form to build a structured literature review database
- Market intelligence analysts scraping vendor product specification sheets and white papers for competitive analysis dashboards
- Investigative journalism teams harvesting government policy documents and white papers in PDF to support data-driven stories on healthcare reform
- Procurement departments automating the download of supplier contracts and technical data sheets in PDF to streamline vendor evaluation processes
