### Development Step 4: Compile All Post-1977 Malko Competition Winners with Nationalities, Including Defunct Countries

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Archiving and trend analysis for music historians mapping post-1977 Malko Competition winners by nationality and geopolitical context
- Classical music database enrichment with automated extraction of winner names, years, and historical country tags for digital library platforms
- Academic research into Cold War–era cultural exchanges, using detailed Malko Competition data for musicology theses on geopolitical influences
- Museum exhibition curation displaying Malko Competition laureates from defunct states (USSR, Yugoslavia, etc.) to illustrate 20th-century political shifts
- Government cultural policy evaluation assessing how nation-state transformations impacted participation and success rates in international music contests
- University course material development, creating interactive timelines of Malko Competition winners tied to historical country changes for world history or music studies
- Record label marketing analytics identifying award-winning artists’ regional origins and historical backgrounds to drive targeted promotional campaigns
