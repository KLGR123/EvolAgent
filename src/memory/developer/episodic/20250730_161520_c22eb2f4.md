### Development Step 4: Find common two-word model type in 2018-19 customer retention studies by Kashyap and Fader

**Description**: Conduct a focused academic literature search for research papers on customer retention studies published during 2018-2019 by authors Manash Pratim Kashyap and PS Fader. Use academic search engines like Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or academic databases. Focus the search on terms like 'Manash Pratim Kashyap customer retention 2018-2019' and 'PS Fader customer retention 2018-2019'. Extract information about the models used in their respective studies, looking specifically for any common two-word model type mentioned in both authors' works.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic researcher automating a comparative literature review of customer retention models cited by Manash Pratim Kashyap and PS Fader from 2018–2019
- Business analyst validating the prevalence of the Pareto/NBD model across Kashyap’s and Fader’s retention studies to inform strategic retention planning
- PhD student mapping the evolution of two-word retention model types in CRM research for inclusion in a dissertation on customer lifetime value
- CRM consultant benchmarking competing retention modeling techniques from targeted 2018–2019 publications to optimize loyalty program designs
- Data scientist integrating extracted model information from Kashyap’s and Fader’s papers into a predictive analytics pipeline for churn forecasting
- Library information specialist building a curated knowledge base of common retention models found in specified author works to support institutional research services
- Market research professional automating trend analysis of retention model usage in academic studies to guide corporate customer retention strategies
- Software developer creating a search-and-extract plugin that identifies and catalogs two-word model names in scholarly articles filtered by author and year

We discuss a series of questions that such an audit should address, along with metrics commonly used to answer them. The most basic measures focus on customer acquisition and retention. Using the Pareto/NBD model and similar approaches, we can use these to generate predictions about future purchasing at the level of both individual customers and the entire base of current customers.",
