### Development Step 2: Search Valentina Re’s Metalepsis in Horror, Dream Worlds, Reality in Boni’s ‘World Building’ (2017)

**Description**: Conduct a web search for the book "World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries" (2017) edited by Marta Boni, focusing on Valentina Re's chapter or contribution. Look specifically for information about metalepsis, horror movies, dream worlds and reality in Valentina Re's work.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated metadata extraction of chapter titles, author contributions, and thematic context from academic anthologies across publisher platforms for a university’s digital repository of transmedia studies
- Building a digital humanities knowledge graph by parsing and linking occurrences of metalepsis, horror motifs, dream sequences, and reality discussions from scholarly sources
- Streamlining academic publishing marketing by scraping and summarizing key insights (e.g., horror movie metalepsis, dream world dynamics) from new edited volumes to generate promotional blurbs and social media posts
- Aggregating contextually relevant quotes about narrative boundaries, metalepsis, and reality disruptions in horror cinema for film studies course preparation, lecture slides, and annotated reading packs
- Powering a scholarly content management system by extracting and tagging author contributions and concept contexts from online repositories (AUP, Google Books, ResearchGate) for advanced search filters and personalized recommendations
- Creating an NLP training corpus by harvesting labeled text snippets around ‘horror’, ‘dreamscape’, ‘reality’, and ‘metalepsis’ to develop genre and thematic classification models
- Automating the integration of JSON-formatted chapter metadata and thematic context excerpts into a university library catalog to enable concept-based discovery of transmedia narratives
- Supporting graduate thesis meta-analysis workflows through automated collection and comparison of ‘reality’ and ‘dream world’ contexts across multiple authors and chapters in transmedia research
