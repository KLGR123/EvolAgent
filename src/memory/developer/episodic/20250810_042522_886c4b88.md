### Development Step 2: List Countries with Gross Savings >35% of GDP (2001â€“2010) Using World Bank API, Sorted Alphabetically

**Description**: Retrieve gross savings as a percentage of GDP (indicator NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS) for all countries for each year from 2001 through 2010 using the World Bank API, then filter the dataset to identify countries whose gross savings value exceeds 35% for every year in that period, extract their English country names, sort them alphabetically, and prepare a comma-separated list.

**Use Cases**:
- Identifying candidate countries for sovereign wealth fund benchmarking by global investment analysts seeking consistently high national savings rates
- Supporting academic research on macroeconomic stability by isolating nations with sustained high gross savings for longitudinal economic studies
- Assisting multinational corporations in market entry strategy by targeting countries with robust domestic capital formation potential
- Enabling international development agencies to prioritize peer-learning programs among countries with exemplary savings behavior
- Automating the selection of case studies for policy think tanks analyzing the drivers of persistent high savings in emerging economies
- Powering data-driven dashboards for global economic monitoring platforms that highlight outlier countries in savings performance
- Facilitating due diligence for infrastructure investors by pre-filtering countries with strong historical savings as a proxy for investment capacity
- Streamlining the process for journalists preparing comparative reports on fiscal prudence by providing a ready-made list of consistently high-saving countries
