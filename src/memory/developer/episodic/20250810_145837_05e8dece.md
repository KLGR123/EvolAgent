### Development Step 23: Determine Australian Captain for Test Where Arthur Morris Scored 300+ Before 1973-74

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal due diligence document scanning and clause verification for corporate compliance teams
- Clinical trial result extraction and safety signal monitoring for pharmaceutical researchers
- Patent literature analysis and prior-art claim summarization for intellectual property attorneys
- Regulatory report auditing and risk disclosure compliance tracking for financial institutions
- Competitive intelligence aggregation and feature claim validation for product managers
- Scientific publication meta-analysis and data synthesis for academic research consortia
- News media fact-checking and rumor verification for investigative journalism teams
- Resume parsing and skill extraction for talent acquisition specialists
