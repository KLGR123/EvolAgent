### Development Step 9: Retrieve oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue with 'Regression' and its creation, closure, label-add timestamps

**Description**: Search GitHub for numpy.polynomial issues to identify all closed issues that have the 'Regression' label. Focus on finding the oldest closed issue with this label and determine when the 'Regression' label was added to that specific issue. Use GitHub's issue search functionality with filters for repository 'numpy/numpy', path 'polynomial', status 'closed', and label 'Regression'. Extract the issue creation date, closure date, and label addition timestamp for the oldest matching issue.

**Use Cases**:
- Open-source project maintainers conducting historical stability audits on numpy.polynomial by extracting the oldest closed regression issue and its label addition timestamp to understand past release risks
- QA engineers automating regression timeline extraction in polynomial modules to include precise bug discovery and labeling dates in risk assessment reports before each software release
- Data science teams analyzing the lag between issue creation and regression labeling in NumPyâ€™s polynomial subpackage to evaluate the reliability of numerical dependencies in production pipelines
- Regulatory compliance officers compiling a timeline of regression label additions for NumPy issues used in medical device software to satisfy audit requirements and ensure traceability
- Academic software engineering researchers mapping the evolution of bug classification practices by studying when regression labels were applied to early NumPy polynomial issues
- DevOps and release managers integrating GitHub regression label timelines into CI/CD dashboards to automatically halt builds if a late-identified regression emerges in critical math libraries
- Technical product managers measuring the time-to-label for regression issues in numerical libraries to refine issue triage SLAs and optimize resource allocation for future development cycles
