### Development Step 2: Compile Mercedes Sosa’s Studio Albums 2000–2009 Using 2022 English Wikipedia

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about Mercedes Sosa's discography, specifically focusing on studio albums released between 2000 and 2009 (inclusive). Use the latest 2022 version of English Wikipedia as the primary source. Target these research approaches: (1) Search for Mercedes Sosa's main Wikipedia page to access her complete discography section, (2) Look for dedicated discography pages or album listings that specify release years and album types, (3) Extract detailed information about each album released during the 2000-2009 period, distinguishing between studio albums and other types (live albums, compilations, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all studio albums with their release years for verification and counting.

**Use Cases**:
- Music streaming metadata automation for a music platform, enriching Mercedes Sosa album entries with verified release years and studio album status
- Cultural heritage digital archiving for a national library project, systematically cataloging Mercedes Sosa’s 2000–2009 studio albums in a preservation database
- Academic musicology research analyzing Latin American folk music trends, extracting precise release-year data for quantitative studies
- Fan community website content generation, automating the creation of detailed Mercedes Sosa discography pages with album names and release dates
- Journalism fact-checking workflows in cultural media outlets, verifying studio album release information for articles on Latin American music history
- Data science pipeline development for music industry analytics, building structured datasets of studio albums (2000–2009) to model release frequency and artist productivity
- Mobile app feature integration in a music discovery application, populating an interactive Mercedes Sosa discography timeline with accurate album details
- Record label internal catalog management, cross-referencing archival records with Wikipedia sources to update and reconcile studio album inventories
