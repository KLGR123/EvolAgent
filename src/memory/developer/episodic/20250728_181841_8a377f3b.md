### Development Step 2: Parse Road Map to Identify Houses by Mile Markers and Compute Distances to Towers

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached file data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt to understand the road layout, identify all house positions, and map their locations relative to mile markers. Extract the visual representation showing dashes (-) as mile markers and H symbols as houses, then determine the coordinate system and calculate distances between houses and potential tower locations.

**Use Cases**:
- Telecom network planners determining optimal cell tower placements along rural highways to minimize average signal distance to homes clustered above and below the road
- Emergency services designing ambulance station or firehouse locations based on household positions along major roadways to reduce response times
- Broadband internet providers mapping potential distribution hub sites along a trunk route to ensure equitable coverage for properties on both sides of the highway
- Utility companies scheduling meter-reading and maintenance by calculating distances from main gas or water pipelines to residential units distributed along a linear corridor
- School transportation coordinators optimizing bus stop placements by analyzing student home mile‐marker positions relative to the bus route
- Real estate developers evaluating proximity of new housing parcels to proposed infrastructure expansions (roads, power lines) for investment decision support
- Environmental planners modeling roadside noise-barrier or greenbelt placement by assessing residential distance metrics from the highway
- Logistics and courier services planning drop‐off zones along delivery routes to minimize total travel and idle time when servicing homes on either side of the roadway
