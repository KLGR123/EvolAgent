### Development Step 4: Extract Professorâ€™s Anagram Question and Criteria from Audio File: Identify Original Phrase and Anagram Instructions

**Description**: Analyze the attached audio file data/gaia/2023/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3 to extract the professor's anagram question. Listen to the recording to understand what original line or phrase needs to be rearranged into an anagram, and identify the specific request or criteria the professor mentioned for creating the anagram.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated extraction and transcription of university lecture audio to generate study materials and identify key exam questions for students
- Digital archiving of oral history interviews, converting spoken content into searchable text and extracting specific challenges or puzzles for educational exhibits
- Quality assurance in online learning platforms by analyzing instructor audio files to verify that assignment instructions are clear and accurately transcribed
- Legal discovery workflows where recorded depositions are transcribed and specific questions or challenges are programmatically identified for case review
- Podcast production automation, where guest challenges or interactive segments are extracted from audio and summarized for show notes or audience engagement
- Accessibility enhancement for visually impaired students by converting complex spoken classroom puzzles into text and structured summaries
- Automated grading assistance in language arts courses by extracting and analyzing audio-based assignments, such as anagram or wordplay challenges, for instructor review
- Corporate training compliance monitoring, where spoken quizzes or knowledge checks in training videos are transcribed and analyzed to ensure regulatory requirements are met
