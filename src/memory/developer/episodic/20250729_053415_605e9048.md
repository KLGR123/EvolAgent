### Development Step 2: Legume Wikipedia 2022 Content Violations: Identify Violated Content, Core Policies, ‘R’ Definition

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated moderation workflow for agricultural wiki: scan the 2022 edit history of the “Legume” article to flag violations of Neutral Point of View, Verifiability, and “R” (Reliable sourcing) policies and alert community administrators.
- Academic research on content censorship: analyze public logs from January–November 2022 for the Legume page to quantify removals of unsourced material and correlate them with the three core Wikipedia policies in a peer-reviewed study.
- Corporate intranet documentation audit: apply the HTML/JSON inspection pipeline to internal policy pages, detect unauthorized removals or reverts, and enforce company information governance standards after each quarterly review.
- Digital preservation tool for libraries: monitor policy breaches and vandalism on taxonomy and species articles, record every content removal incident through 2022, and archive original revisions for long-term access.
- Investigative journalism dashboard: ingest Wikipedia edit histories for high-traffic science pages (e.g., Legume) to identify sudden spikes in “removed” or “vandalism” mentions during key events and support data-driven reporting.
- NGO transparency reporting: track policy infractions across public knowledge platforms, generate monthly summaries of content violations in agricultural entries, and publish compliance metrics for donors and stakeholders.
- Government open-data monitoring: continuously inspect municipal and environmental wiki pages for unauthorized edits or policy violations, trigger security tickets for high-priority incidents, and maintain public trust in service documentation.
