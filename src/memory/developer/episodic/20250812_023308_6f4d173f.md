### Development Step 24: Identify French-Born, Early Hollywood Technicolor Composers for 1976 Montreal Olympics Music

**Description**: Search for composers who worked on the 1976 Montreal Olympics theme music with a focus on identifying any who were born in France and had connections to early Hollywood film studios, particularly those involved in Technicolor productions. Expand the search beyond Pioneer Pictures to include other studios from the 1930s-1940s era that may have employed French-born composers. Look for Olympic fanfares, ceremonial music, or broadcast themes from the 1976 Montreal Games that were composed by French musicians with film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Archival metadata enrichment for a film music library: Automate the discovery of French-born composers with 1930sâ€“1940s Hollywood/Technicolor credits who scored the 1976 Montreal Olympics theme, and update archive records with accurate biographical and studio affiliation data.
- Documentary production research support: Rapidly identify and verify composer names, birthplaces, and early studio work to ensure correct on-screen credits and biographical notes in a documentary about the 1976 Montreal Olympic ceremonies.
- Broadcast licensing and rights clearance automation: Gather composer identities and associated film studios to streamline the clearance process for rebroadcasting or licensing the Montreal 1976 opening ceremony music in TV and streaming services.
- Academic musicology course content development: Compile detailed case studies of French-born film composers turned Olympic theme creators for lectures, assignments, and research references in university-level music history and film scoring classes.
- Cultural heritage exhibition curation: Provide museum curators with validated composer profiles and studio backgrounds to design exhibit panels and program notes for a retrospective on Olympic fanfares and mid-20th-century film music.
- Event branding and creative agency briefing: Supply marketing teams with historical composer-studio insights to inspire and accurately attribute new fanfare compositions for anniversary celebrations or sports events honoring the 1976 Montreal Games.
- Music rights management reporting: Integrate the search tool into a rights platform to auto-generate reports on composer origins, film credits, and studio ties for royalty distribution and internal auditing of Olympic music catalogs.
- AI-driven music recommendation dataset creation: Build a structured dataset of French-born, Hollywood-connected composers and their Olympic works to train recommendation engines for vintage sports and film music playlists.
