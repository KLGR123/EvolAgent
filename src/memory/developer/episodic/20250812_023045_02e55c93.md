### Development Step 17: Search French-Origin Pioneer Pictures Composers of 1976 Montreal Olympics Theme Music.

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements and search for alternative composers who both worked for Pioneer Pictures and composed theme music for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. The previous research focused on André Mathieu who was born in Canada, not France, which doesn't match the TASK criteria. Search for other composers associated with the 1976 Montreal Olympics who might have French origins and Pioneer Pictures connections, including any secondary composers, arrangers, or musicians involved in the Olympic ceremonies who had film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Film archival teams automating the cross-referencing of composer credits between Pioneer Pictures archives and the 1976 Montreal Olympic ceremony records
- Academic musicology researchers compiling a dataset of French-born composers who scored Olympic event music for a doctoral thesis
- Sports event organizers scouting composers with prior Olympic ceremony experience and film studio backgrounds for upcoming opening ceremonies
- Music licensing departments automating the identification of copyright holders of Olympic theme tracks produced by Pioneer Pictures–affiliated French artists
- Cultural heritage institutions enriching digital archives by linking Pioneer Pictures film scores to Montreal 1976 Olympic ceremonies through web-based search analysis
- Documentary producers sourcing interview candidates by finding secondary or orchestration composers involved in the 1976 Olympics music team with French origins
- Genealogy researchers tracing the career trajectories of French-emigrant composers who worked for Pioneer Pictures and contributed to major sporting event soundtracks
- Music festival programmers curating themed concert series featuring Olympic compositions by French film composers, using automated search to uncover obscure artist names
