### Development Step 11: Search Player with Distinctive Walk Nickname, 29 SB in 1970, 1971 White Sox–McCraw Trade

**Description**: Search for information about a baseball player who had an unusual walk style nickname, stole 29 bases in the 1970 season, and was involved in a trade between the Chicago White Sox and another team in 1971 where Tommy McCraw was exchanged. Focus on identifying this player's distinctive nickname related to his walking style, his 1970 season statistics showing exactly 29 stolen bases, and the specific 1971 trade details involving McCraw going to the team that had previously traded this player to the White Sox.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports museum curator’s data pipeline for analyzing 1970s MLB player nicknames, stolen‐base records, and trade details to power an interactive exhibit on baseball legends
- Regional bank’s automated compliance auditor that ingests JSON trade logs, cross‐references counterparty details and stolen‐base analogies for anomaly detection in client portfolios
- Ph.D. candidate’s research assistant script aggregating archival Baseball-Reference HTML and JSON exports to confirm statistical criteria and trade narratives for a dissertation on player mobility
- Manufacturing maintenance scheduler that parses machine vibration JSON outputs (“walking style” metrics), correlates anomaly thresholds, and generates a timeline report for preventative servicing
- Marketing analytics automation for a baseball merchandise retailer, extracting player popularity signals from sales and social JSON feeds, comparing stolen-base performance to promotional campaign lift
- DevOps incident reporter for a sports data API, scanning workspace JSON logs of failed data pulls, summarizing error counts by endpoint, and producing a chronological outage summary
- Investigative sports journalist’s toolkit that merges nickname etymology, 1970 season statistics, and 1971 trade histories from multiple JSON sources to fact-check an in-depth feature article
- E-commerce vendor performance dashboard for a collectibles platform, loading seller inventory and transaction JSON files, highlighting trade imbalances, nickname‐tagged product trends and restock alerts
