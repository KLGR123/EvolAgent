### Development Step 9: Extract Survivor Seasons 1–44 Winners from Wikipedia and Save as workspace/survivor_winners_list.json

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Television network scheduling optimization by automatically extracting seasons 1–44 winners into JSON for aligning anniversary marathons and promotional segments
- Trivia app content generation using the structured winners list to populate quiz questions about Survivor champions
- Entertainment news site data integration to keep a live leaderboard of Survivor winners and facilitate SEO-rich winner profile pages
- Social media marketing automation that posts winner highlights and anniversaries by pulling names and seasons from the JSON file
- Academic study of reality-TV demographics by exporting season and winner data for statistical analysis of diversity trends over 44 seasons
- Fan community web app development for building interactive timelines of Survivor champions using the parsed JSON dataset
- Sponsorship performance analysis by correlating winner appearances and brand mentions across seasons 1–44 with marketing spend data
