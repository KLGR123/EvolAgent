### Development Step 30: Find first Australian to manage Notts County or any Aussie manager with Italian kit ties

**Description**: Search for information about which Australian football manager was the first to manage Notts County specifically, or alternatively search for any Australian managers who have managed English clubs with historical Italian kit connections. Focus on finding if there's a different Australian manager than Harry Kewell who managed an English club that actually sent replica kits to Italian clubs. Search for keywords including 'Australian manager Notts County', 'first Australian football manager Italian kit connection', 'Australian coach English club Juventus connection', and 'Notts County Australian manager history'.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports journalism fact-checking for a feature on “first Australian manager at an English club” to ensure accuracy before publication
- Football club HR analytics pipeline to identify and benchmark international manager hiring trends, starting with Australian appointments
- Brand marketing research into historical Italian kit replica partnerships, guiding a kit manufacturer’s limited-edition design strategy
- Academic sports management study cataloging foreign manager appointments and their impact on lower-league club performance
- Legal due diligence on trademark and licensing compliance for cross-border replica kit distributions involving Australian coaches
- Automated enrichment of a football statistics platform, extracting manager nationalities, appointment dates, and club affiliations from raw search data
- Digital archiving for a sports heritage project, indexing milestones of Australian figures in English football clubs for museum exhibits
- Corporate sponsorship analysis to track nationality-driven activation opportunities and kit licensing deals in international football markets
