### Development Step 6: US Survivor Winners and Birth Dates: Identify May-Born Winners Using Official and Reputable Databases (Seasons 1–44)

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about US Survivor winners and their birth dates. Focus on finding official sources such as CBS Survivor databases, Wikipedia pages, or entertainment databases that list all winners from Season 1 through the most recent season available as of August 2023. Extract winner names, seasons, and birth dates to identify any winners born in May.

**Use Cases**:
- Entertainment journalism research for compiling birthday-themed Survivor winner features or articles
- Automated database enrichment for TV trivia apps that highlight unique facts, such as winners born in specific months
- Academic studies in media or sociology analyzing demographic trends among reality TV show winners
- Fan community engagement, such as creating birthday shoutouts or themed Survivor events based on winner birth months
- Talent agency scouting and profiling for reality TV alumni, including detailed biographical data collection
- Data-driven content creation for YouTube or podcasts focusing on Survivor statistics and fun facts
