### Development Step 15: Identify Italian club given Crawley Town replica kits with 1903 black-and-white English-inspired stripes

**Description**: Search for information about Crawley Town's historical connections to Italian football clubs, specifically focusing on any replica kit donations or collaborations with Italian clubs that operated in 1903, introduced black and white striped kits, and were inspired by English football clubs. Search for keywords including 'Crawley Town Italian football club replica kits', 'Crawley Town kit donation Italy', 'Italian football club 1903 black white stripes English inspiration', and 'Juventus Notts County kit connection Crawley Town'. Focus on identifying which specific Italian club received replica kits from Crawley Town and verify this club's historical details match the description in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports heritage museum automates verification of vintage football kit provenance by analyzing digital archive search results and generating detailed reports on historical kit donations and manufacturing collaborations
- Media fact-checking unit for a sports news outlet uses the tool to rapidly validate or refute claims about historical club partnerships and player-mediated kit transfers before article publication
- Legal consulting firm specializing in sports law employs the system to gather and categorize evidence on sponsorship disputes, verifying contractual claims of past kit donations
- Academic researcher in sports history automates extraction and summarization of search result metadata to support publications on the evolution of football club colors and kit design influences
- Performance marketing team at a sportswear company monitors competitor brand partnerships by categorizing digital mentions and summarizing key findings on sponsorship relationships over time
- Football governing body integrates the solution for compliance audits, ensuring clubs accurately report historical kit sponsors and donations in official federation records
- Digital archiving service combines the code into its pipeline to parse and index search results, producing final summary briefs for sports heritage collections
