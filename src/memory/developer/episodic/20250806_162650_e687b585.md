### Development Step 1: Optimal Ping-Pong Ball Selection via Piston Firing State Transition Simulations

**Description**: Analyze the ping-pong ball game mechanics to determine which ball number has the highest probability of being ejected by the pistons. Model the game state transitions for each possible piston firing (positions 1, 2, or 3) and simulate the process to calculate ejection probabilities for all 100 balls, then identify the optimal ball number to maximize winning chances.

**Use Cases**:
- Industrial automation calibration and optimization of pneumatic actuator firing sequences to maximize defective-part ejection in injection-molding quality control
- Sports equipment R&D for ping-pong ball launchers, simulating piston positions and chain-reaction effects to achieve consistent ball speeds in training machines
- Automated warehouse robotics tuning, modeling bin-ejection pistons at different rack levels to improve pick-and-place success rates in high-throughput fulfillment centers
- Pharmaceutical tablet press setup, analyzing which ejection piston yields the highest intact tablet output and minimizes breakage during chain-reaction ejection
- Arcade and gaming hardware development, evaluating pinball flipper and ball-shooter piston placements to ensure uniform ejection probabilities and fair gameplay dynamics
- Water feature and fountain design, simulating multi-nozzle piston timings to optimize droplet heights and patterns for choreographed water displays
- Reliability engineering research on cascade-failure probabilities in complex systems, using piston-trigger simulations to identify the most failure-prone component positions
