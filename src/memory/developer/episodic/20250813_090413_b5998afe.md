### Development Step 37: Identify Writer and Artist of Symbiotic-Focused Star Trek Aliens Comic Featuring Stalked Researcher

**Description**: Search for information about the Star Trek Aliens series to identify comics featuring a researcher protagonist stalked after a science expedition that explores symbiotic relationships central to the species' biology. Focus on finding the writer of this specific Star Trek comic and then identify which artist this writer collaborates with, as this will help establish another part of the collaboration chain that connects back to Jeff Lemire and Andrea Sorrentino from the Green Arrow weapon recovery storyline.

**Use Cases**:
- Patent portfolio analysis and inventor collaboration network mapping in technology R&D strategy
- Academic journal article scraping and co-author relationship identification for university research offices
- Legal precedent discovery and recurring judge‐attorney partnership mapping for law firm case planning
- E-commerce product review aggregation and supplier-distributor relationship analysis for market competitiveness insights
- Pharmaceutical clinical trial registry scanning and principal investigator collaboration tracking for drug development pipeline management
- Venture capital deal sourcing via startup news extraction and founder-investor network analysis for investment decision support
- Music credit data mining and songwriter-producer collaboration mapping for record label A&R departments
- Industrial supply chain monitoring through contract award scraping and vendor-subcontractor partnership visualization for supply risk management
