### Development Step 2: Post-1977 20th-Century Malko Competition Winners and Their Nationalities (Including Defunct States)

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Archiving and extracting grant awardees from a foundation’s online records (2000–2020) to analyze funding trends by recipient nationality
- Aggregating hackathon winner data from multiple tech event websites post-2015 for corporate sponsorship decision support
- Mining patent award information from USPTO HTML archives to map inventor nationalities and identify innovation hotspots
- Automating extraction of sanctioned entities from government PDF/HTML sanction lists to keep compliance databases up to date
- Building a music streaming service feature that compiles historical competition winners and their nationalities for curated playlists
- Parsing academic conference websites to index keynote speakers and their affiliations for university library catalogs
- Extracting sports tournament champions from archived sports federation pages to feed a real-time analytics dashboard for media outlets
