### Development Step 4: ClinicalTrials.gov Search for H. pylori Treatment in Acne Vulgaris Patients, Jan‚ÄìMay 2018 Enrollment

**Description**: Search the NIH clinical trials database (ClinicalTrials.gov) for clinical trials involving H. pylori treatment in acne vulgaris patients that were conducted during the January-May 2018 timeframe. Extract the actual enrollment count from the trial listing, focusing on studies that specifically examine the relationship between H. pylori infection and acne vulgaris treatment during this exact time period.

**Use Cases**:
- Pharmaceutical market intelligence: automated extraction of H. pylori‚Äìrelated acne trial enrollments from ClinicalTrials.gov (Jan‚ÄìMay 2018) to inform competitor R&D decisions.
- Dermatology research consortium compiling JSON datasets of enrollment counts and study metadata for trials examining acne vulgaris and Helicobacter pylori co-infection.
- Biostatistics core facility feeding enrollment figures and trial statuses into a live dashboard tracking repurposed antibiotic therapies in dermatological studies.
- Regulatory affairs team verifying phase II/III trial registrations and participant numbers for acne treatment protocols involving H. pylori to ensure FDA reporting compliance.
- Meta-analysis group retrieving time-restricted clinical trial data on acne and H. pylori interactions to perform systematic reviews and statistical pooling of patient cohorts.
- Health policy analyst assessing public funding allocations by querying ClinicalTrials.gov for antibiotic versus dermatology trial enrollments in early 2018.
- Clinical data science consultancy producing structured feeds of trial metadata and enrollment counts to train machine learning models on biomedical study relevance.
