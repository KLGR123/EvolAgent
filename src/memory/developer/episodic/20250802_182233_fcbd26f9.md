### Development Step 7: Targeted ClinicalTrials.gov H. pylori & Acne Vulgaris Trials Search with Synonyms Extended Jan–May 2018 Registration

**Description**: Conduct a more targeted search specifically for clinical trials with exact phrase matching for 'H. pylori' AND 'acne vulgaris' on ClinicalTrials.gov, then expand the search timeframe to include trials that may have been registered or updated during Jan-May 2018 but had different start/end dates. Also search for variations like 'Helicobacter pylori' and 'acne' to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential trial listings that match the TASK criteria.

**Use Cases**:
- Clinical research coordinators automating identification of registered trials combining H. pylori eradication and acne vulgaris treatment for streamlined protocol development
- Dermatology clinicians seeking up-to-date trial registries on Helicobacter pylori–related acne interventions to inform off-label antibiotic prescribing
- Pharmaceutical market intelligence analysts tracking emerging clinical studies on microbiome-targeted acne therapies for competitive landscape assessment
- Regulatory affairs specialists compiling exhaustive lists of H. pylori and acne vulgaris trials registered or updated between January and May 2018 for FDA submission dossiers
- Biomedical data scientists integrating scraped ClinicalTrials.gov metadata into machine learning pipelines to predict therapeutic outcomes in acne vulgaris
- Systematic review authors cross-referencing individual NCT identifiers from separate H. pylori and acne searches to identify overlapping studies for meta-analysis inclusion
- Grant writers gathering evidence of existing clinical trial activity on Helicobacter pylori’s role in dermatologic conditions to support funding applications
- Health informatics teams building automated dashboards that monitor new or updated clinical trials on H. pylori and acne to alert stakeholders of research trends
