### Development Step 15: Identify Washington County Seats with Largest and Smallest Land Areas and Their 2020 Census Populations

**Description**: Identify the largest and smallest county seats by land area from the complete dataset of 39 Washington state county seats with their land area measurements. Then extract the 2020 census population data for these two specific county seats using the official data.census.gov source as specified in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban planning and zoning standardization: compare the largest and smallest county seats by land area and 2020 population to set minimum service coverage benchmarks across Washington counties
- Real estate investment analysis: analyze population density in the smallest land-area county seat versus the largest to identify high-growth, undervalued development opportunities
- Emergency response optimization: model ambulance and fire station placement by contrasting travel times and resource needs in the most expansive and most compact county seats
- Environmental impact and conservation planning: assess undeveloped land proportions in the largest county seat against population pressure in the smallest to prioritize habitat protection projects
- GIS dashboard automation for state agencies: build a data pipeline that extracts area extremes and census populations monthly to update interactive public maps
- Academic demographic research: conduct comparative studies on land-use efficiency and population distribution between the largest and smallest county seats for peer-reviewed journals
- Logistics network design for distributors: use area-to-population ratios of the extreme county seats to optimize warehouse siting and last-mile delivery routes
- Public health resource allocation: model hospital bed and vaccination clinic requirements based on population density differences in the largest versus smallest county seats
