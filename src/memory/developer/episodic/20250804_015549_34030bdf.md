### Development Step 17: Inspect START’s Four Two-Cell Neighbors in grid_data.json: Text and 6-Digit Hex Colors

**Description**: Inspect workspace/grid_data.json entries for the four cardinal two-cell neighbor coordinates of the START cell by locating the coordinates (start_x±2, start_y) and (start_x, start_y±2) based on the recorded START position in workspace/start_end_coordinates.json; report each neighbor’s displayed text and 6-digit hex fill color to verify which moves from START are actually legal.

**Use Cases**:
- Board game AI move validation for a two-cell knight variant in a digital chess platform
- Autonomous warehouse robot navigation checks for reachable storage bins two grid units away
- GIS raster adjacency inspection to verify land parcel connectivity in environmental planning
- Traffic flow simulation grid analysis for vehicle lane-change feasibility at discrete intervals
- Manufacturing floor layout verification to ensure machine stations are accessible within two-unit hops
- Medical imaging pixel-neighborhood extraction to detect tissue anomalies two pixels from a tumor boundary
- Maze-solving algorithm debugging by reporting legal two-cell jumps from the entry point in puzzle apps
- Cellular automata research validating neighbor state transitions two cells apart in bioinformatics models
