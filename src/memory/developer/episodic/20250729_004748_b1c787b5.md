### Development Step 3: Check Hamiltonian Cycle in Earl’s 49-Plot Adjacency Graph

**Description**: Solve the Hamiltonian path problem to determine if Earl can walk through every plot he owns exactly once and return to his starting plot without backtracking. Using the identified 49 green plots from the previous analysis, construct a graph where each plot is a node and edges connect adjacent plots (horizontally and vertically neighboring cells). Apply graph theory algorithms to check if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in Earl's connected land area, considering movement constraints between adjacent plots only.

**Use Cases**:
- Precision agriculture drone routing: plan a drone’s flight over 49 designated crop plots (geofenced grid cells) to apply fertilizer exactly once per plot and return to the charging station, optimizing battery life by only moving between adjacent GPS waypoints.
- Autonomous warehouse robot navigation: compute a guided vehicle’s path through every assigned storage bay in a racked warehouse (modeled as a grid) exactly once, looping back to its docking bay without retracing aisles.
- Smart city waste collection: design a garbage truck route across contiguous urban blocks (each block as a grid plot), ensuring each block is serviced exactly once before returning to the depot, under street‐adjacency constraints.
- Data center maintenance scheduling: generate a technician’s walkway through every server rack location laid out on a grid floor plan, visiting each rack exactly once and returning to the entrance without backtracking corridors.
- Facility security patrol planning: create a continuous patrol route that covers each security checkpoint on a building’s floor grid exactly once, then returns to the security office, respecting doorway adjacencies and minimizing redundant passage.
- PCB inspection automation: program a pick‐and‐place machine to traverse all test points on a printed circuit board (represented as grid nodes) exactly once, then return to the home position, optimizing head movement between adjacent points.
- Archaeological site survey mapping: plan a field surveyor’s walking route through each excavation cell in a gridded dig site exactly once, returning to the base camp while moving only between adjacent, safe-to-traverse cells.
