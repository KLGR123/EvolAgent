### Development Step 7: Identify the Missing Gift-Giver by Comparing Assigned Givers to Actual Gifts Exchanged

**Description**: Determine which employee did not give a gift by comparing the list of twelve employees who were assigned to give gifts against the eleven gifts that were actually given. Cross-reference each actual gift with its giver based on the recipient's profile interests, then identify which of the twelve assigned gift-givers is missing from the actual gift exchange list.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate Secret Santa coordination: automatically match assigned gift-givers to recipients by interest profiles, verify which gifts were delivered, and pinpoint the employee who forgot to give a gift
- Nonprofit volunteer appreciation distribution: cross-reference assigned thank-you packages based on volunteer service areas with actual shipment logs to ensure each volunteer received the correct gift and detect any missing deliveries
- E-commerce customer loyalty reward fulfillment: compare personalized reward assignments from purchase histories against shipped items, match gifts to customer profiles, and flag unfulfilled or missing reward orders
- Conference attendee swag management: match pre-assigned swag items tailored to attendee interests (tech gadgets, notebooks, apparel) with check-in scans at distribution booths to identify attendees who haven’t collected their items
- HR onboarding kit tracking: verify that each new hire’s custom orientation package (branded merchandise, role-specific guides) has been shipped and received by matching assignment records to delivery confirmations, highlighting any undelivered kits
- Academic research participant incentives: ensure study participants receive the correct compensation (gift cards, merchandise) matched to their demographic profiles, and identify participants who have not yet received their incentives
- University alumni thank-you mailings: cross-reference alumni gift preferences with mailing logs to confirm branded donor gifts are sent to the right individuals and surface any missed or delayed mailings
- E-learning certification issuance: match course completion records against generated digital certificates, verify one-to-one correspondence, and detect learners who completed training but did not receive their certificates
