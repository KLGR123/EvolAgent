### Development Step 1: Total number of Nature journal’s peer-reviewed research articles published in 2020

**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Use Cases**:
- University research office compiling annual publication metrics for performance review and grant reporting
- Academic librarians analyzing Nature’s 2020 research output to negotiate subscription licenses and budget allocations
- Meta-analysis researchers quantifying publication trends in high-impact journals for bibliometric studies
- Science journalists aggregating peer-reviewed article counts for end-of-year coverage on Nature’s scientific impact
- Data scientists integrating Nature 2020 research article statistics into institutional dashboards for strategic planning
- Grant administrators verifying peer-reviewed publication counts to support funding proposals and renewal dossiers
- Library consortia benchmarking Nature’s research output against competing journals to inform collection development decisions
