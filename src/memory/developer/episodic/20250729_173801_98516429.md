### Development Step 3: Compile Complete List of J.K. Rowling’s Bloomsbury-Published Books with Publication Details

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about books written by J.K. Rowling and published by Bloomsbury. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Direct search for 'J.K. Rowling Bloomsbury published books', (2) Search specifically for Harry Potter series publication details, (3) Look for J.K. Rowling bibliography with publisher information, (4) Check Bloomsbury's official website or catalog for J.K. Rowling titles. Focus on identifying all books that match both criteria (author: J.K. Rowling, publisher: Bloomsbury) and compile a complete list with publication dates and details.

**Use Cases**:
- Library metadata enrichment and publisher verification for university catalog systems to ensure J.K. Rowling works are accurately listed with Bloomsbury edition details
- Online bookstore inventory automation and price-comparison integration for Bloomsbury-published J.K. Rowling titles, keeping listings up to date
- Literary research database compilation and timeline analysis for scholars studying the publication history of J.K. Rowling with Bloomsbury
- Affiliate content generation and SEO optimization for book review websites, auto-populating Bloomsbury edition titles and release dates
- Rights and licensing management dashboard development for agencies to track Bloomsbury-published J.K. Rowling titles and contract renewal dates
- Curriculum planning tool for school librarians to build reading lists with verified Bloomsbury edition details of the Harry Potter series
- E-book platform metadata synchronization service to match Bloomsbury publisher information and publication dates for digital J.K. Rowling editions
- Fan community app feature implementation to display a complete Bloomsbury-published bibliography and publication timeline of J.K. Rowling’s works
