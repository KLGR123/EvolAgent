### Development Step 26: Determine Cities of Santa Clara University and UMass Boston, Ordered West to East

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- University admissions analytics dashboard uses the generated westernmost/easternmost city list to prioritize regional recruitment efforts on the U.S. West and East Coasts
- Campus tour coordination team integrates the comma-separated city output to optimize cross-country travel itineraries for prospective student visits
- National educational marketing agency leverages the extremal city pair to segment digital ad campaigns targeting Santa Clara and Boston areas
- Academic geographers incorporate the identified coastal extremity cities into research on longitudinal distribution of U.S. higher education institutions
- State education departments embed the scriptâ€™s result in resource allocation reports to ensure support spans from California to Massachusetts campuses
- Higher ed data warehousing teams automate weekly operational dashboards by including the westernmost/easternmost university cities
- GIS developers feed the comma-separated city pair into mapping APIs to visualize nationwide university network coverage extremes
