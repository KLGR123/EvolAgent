### Development Step 30: Extract Survivor (US) Season 1–44 Winners from Wikipedia into a JSON file

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- TV trivia mobile app content generation and dynamic quiz creation using the exact list of Survivor winners from seasons 1–44
- Reality‐show analytics dashboard for media companies to visualize winner demographics and detect trends over four decades of Survivor
- Automated social media publishing pipeline that posts “On this day Survivor crowned a winner” reminders based on the extracted season→winner data
- Podcast research workflow for entertainment journalists preparing in-depth historical episodes on Survivor champions, with winners’ names pre-loaded
- Machine learning dataset assembly for NLP models to generate TV show summaries and factoids, leveraging the structured Survivor winners list
- Voice assistant skill development enabling Alexa/Google Home to answer “Who won Survivor season X?” queries instantly from the JSON file
- Fantasy reality league platform automation using historical Survivor winner data to seed player rankings and power-ups
- Media studies curriculum content curation where instructors import the Survivor winners JSON to analyse representation and voting patterns over 44 seasons
