### Development Step 22: Find French-origin Pioneer Pictures Composer for 1976 Montreal Olympic Theme Music

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements and search for alternative composers who both worked for Pioneer Pictures and composed theme music for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. The previous research focused on André Mathieu who was born in Canada, not France, which doesn't match the TASK criteria. Search for other composers associated with the 1976 Montreal Olympics who might have French origins and Pioneer Pictures connections, including any secondary composers, arrangers, or musicians involved in the Olympic ceremonies who had film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Film and music archivists automating the verification of composer origins and Pioneer Pictures studio credit when cataloging the 1976 Montreal Olympics opening ceremony recordings
- Legal licensing teams extracting French composer credentials and their Pioneer Pictures affiliations to expedite rights clearance for an upcoming Montreal Olympics documentary
- Academic musicology research groups performing large-scale text analysis of web search results to identify overlooked French composers active in Olympic ceremonies and film scoring
- Digital humanities projects building a structured, queryable database of composer biographies by parsing JSON metadata for nationality, film studio ties, and Olympic involvement
- Film production research departments sourcing historically accurate French composers with verified Pioneer Pictures connections to score a period sports drama set around the 1976 Olympics
- Cultural heritage organizations automating extraction of composer details from online archives to develop an interactive museum exhibit on Olympic music history
- Business intelligence analysts monitoring search result trends for French film composer profiles and their Olympic theme contributions to inform strategic partnerships for music licensing
- Educational media teams generating automated composer profiles and reference lists for online courses on film scoring and sports event music through JSON data analysis
