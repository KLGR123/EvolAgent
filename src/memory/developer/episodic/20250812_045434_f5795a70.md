### Development Step 5: Identify the odd walk-style nickname, 1970’s 29 stolen bases, and 1971 Tommy McCraw trade

**Description**: Search for information about a baseball player who had an unusual walk style nickname, stole 29 bases in the 1970 season, and was involved in a trade between the Chicago White Sox and another team in 1971 where Tommy McCraw was exchanged. Focus on identifying this player's distinctive nickname related to his walking style, his 1970 season statistics showing exactly 29 stolen bases, and the specific 1971 trade details involving McCraw going to the team that had previously traded this player to the White Sox.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports journalism fact-checking: Automate extraction of 1970 season stolen base data and 1971 trade details to verify the “duck walk” nickname story in a retrospective article for a baseball magazine
- Fantasy baseball draft optimizer: Pull player stats (e.g., exactly 29 steals in 1970) and unique traits like unusual walking styles to flag undervalued speedsters before league drafts
- Academic sports research: Build a structured dataset of player nicknames, stolen base metrics, and trade timelines to analyze correlations between persona branding and on-field performance
- Memorabilia e-commerce tagging: Scrape transaction logs and bio pages to enrich collectible listings with accurate 1971 trade partners (White Sox↔Angels/Senators) and quirky nickname trivia
- Sports analytics platform ETL: Automate HTML parsing and JSON inspection of Baseball Reference pages to feed machine learning models that predict player market value based on stats plus fan-perceived attributes
- Baseball fan website content automation: Regularly scan player profile pages for new anecdotes (walking-style nicknames) and season highlights to auto-generate blog posts or social media trivia
- Mobile app feature for anniversaries: Schedule scrapers to fetch unique player details (trade dates, nicknames, stolen base counts) and trigger push notifications on significant trade or milestone anniversaries
