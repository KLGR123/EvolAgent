### Development Step 1: Determine Missing Edge Cube Colors in Rubik’s Cube from Found-Cube Constraints

**Description**: Analyze the Rubik's cube structure and systematically determine which cubes have been found based on the given constraints. Start by establishing the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cube composition: 6 center cubes (one colored face each), 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each), and 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each). Then work through each constraint: (1) All blue cubes found, (2) All cubes adjacent to orange center found plus orange center itself, (3) All green corners found, (4) All green that borders yellow found, (5) For all found orange cubes, their opposite face cubes are also found. Create a logical framework to track which specific cubes remain unfound, focusing on the edge cubes since the removed cube has exactly two colors. Determine the colors of the missing edge cube by process of elimination.

**Use Cases**:
- Toy manufacturing quality assurance in Rubik’s cube production lines: automating detection of missing or miscolored edge pieces via cube state analysis before packaging
- Augmented reality educational platform for teaching constraint logic and combinatorics: visualizing found versus missing cubelets and guiding students through elimination puzzles
- Robotic assembly validation in automated puzzle packaging systems: verifying that each dispatched Rubik’s cube contains the full set of edge and corner pieces
- Puzzle rental service inventory management: scanning returned cubes to quickly identify any missing edge pieces and trigger replacement orders
- Competitive speedcubing training analytics: analyzing cube initialization states to detect unintended piece rearrangements and optimize startup consistency
- Academic research in group theory and permutation puzzles: programmatically generating missing‐piece scenarios to study solvability under different constraint sets
- Virtual Rubik’s cube solver diagnostic tool: identifying and isolating missing edge cubes in digital simulations to aid debugging and developer testing
- Mechanical puzzle–based security lock integrity check: verifying the completeness of a cube lock mechanism by ensuring no edge components have been tampered with or removed
