### Development Step 2: Extract Hidden Sentence from a 5×7 Letter Grid by Reading Rows Left-to-Right

**Description**: Analyze the 5x7 block of text by reading all letters from left to right, row by row, to extract a meaningful sentence. Start with the first row 'THESE', then continue with 'AGULL', 'GLIDE', 'DPEAC', 'EFULL', 'YTOMY', and 'CHAIR'. Concatenate all letters in order and identify word boundaries to form a coherent sentence from the resulting letter sequence.

**Use Cases**:
- Escape room designers validating and debugging a 5×7 letter‐block puzzle that reveals a clue sentence when read row by row
- Museum exhibit developers building an interactive station to decipher hidden messages in historical letter grids for visitor engagement
- Intelligence analysts automating the extraction of covert instructions from intercepted fixed-size text matrices in secure communications
- Educational software engineers creating language-learning modules where students parse letter blocks to form meaningful sentences
- Digital archivists reconstructing fragmented medieval manuscripts by concatenating surviving grid lines and inferring word boundaries
- Marketing teams embedding secret promotional taglines in product packaging letter arrays, then verifying correct message retrieval
- Cryptography instructors demonstrating steganographic techniques by having students systematically analyze and extract sentences from text blocks
