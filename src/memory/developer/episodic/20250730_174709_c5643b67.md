### Development Step 3: Identify the First Named Place in the Book of Esther (NIV)

**Description**: Perform a search to identify the first place mentioned by name in the Book of Esther in the New International Version (NIV) of the Bible. Use Bible reference websites or online Bible resources to locate and read the beginning of the Book of Esther in the NIV translation specifically.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated Bible study tool that scrapes the Book of Esther (NIV) to extract and highlight the first geographical reference for Sunday School presentation slides
- Historical GIS mapping workflow for academic researchers, pulling place names from ancient texts and plotting them on interactive maps
- Church sermon preparation assistant that automatically fetches passages and identifies key locations to enrich contextual illustrations
- Comparative translation analysis system for theologians, retrieving verses from multiple Bible versions to verify consistency of place names across editions
- Educational language-learning app for seminary students that tags and translates biblical place names in real time to build geographical and linguistic context
- Content curation pipeline for a Christian online academy that generates quizzes and flashcards based on the order and context of location mentions in scripture
- Publishing quality-control process for Bible study editions, scraping and validating all geographical references before print to ensure editorial accuracy
- Digital archive indexing solution for theology libraries, using web scraping and named-entity extraction to catalog manuscripts by their mentioned locations
