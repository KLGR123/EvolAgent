### Development Step 2: Find City with October 2019 Planning Permission for Homeless Shelter-to-Flats Conversion

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the city where a developer received planning permission in October 2019 to convert a homeless shelter into flats. Focus on searching for news articles, planning applications, and local government records from October 2019 using keywords like 'October 2019 planning permission homeless shelter flats conversion', 'homeless shelter converted flats October 2019', and 'planning permission shelter housing development 2019'. Cross-reference results with locations that have Bournemouth Seafront areas containing Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th century historic villas, and conservation areas designated in 1987.

**Use Cases**:
- Real estate investment due diligence: automatically extract and verify October 2019 planning permissions for property conversions (e.g., homeless shelter to flats) to assess redevelopment opportunities in Bournemouth and similar coastal towns
- Urban planning research and heritage conservation: cross-reference local government records with landmark datasets (Russell-Cotes Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th-century villas) to study the impact of conservation areas designated in 1987 on new developments
- Automated news media fact-checking: scan and analyze web articles for developer names, planning permission dates, and locations to validate claims about high-profile projects (e.g., Harry Redknapp‚Äôs Pierfront Properties approval)
- Government transparency dashboards: aggregate and visualize planning application outcomes by date, developer, and city (such as Bournemouth in October 2019) to support public policy analysis and citizen engagement
- Legal property compliance monitoring: track the approval status of planning permissions for former homeless accommodations to ensure developers comply with council conditions and heritage requirements
- Tourism and cultural guide enrichment: verify the presence of specific landmarks and recent development changes (flats conversion, conservation areas) when generating up-to-date travel guides for Bournemouth‚Äôs seafront attractions
- Social impact assessment for NGOs: compile and analyze data on shelter-to-housing conversion projects approved in 2019 to report on local homelessness alleviation efforts and inform funding decisions
