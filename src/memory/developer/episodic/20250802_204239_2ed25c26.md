### Development Step 58: Extract 2011 Bulgarian Census Tertiary Education Graduates by Gender

**Description**: Extract the specific tertiary education completion data by gender from the downloaded Census2011final_en.pdf file in the workspace. Parse the document to locate the section containing tertiary education graduates by educational-qualification degree and sex, then extract the exact numbers of men and women who completed tertiary education according to the 2011 Bulgarian census.

**Use Cases**:
- Government policy design for gender-focused scholarship programs using tertiary education completion gaps to target funding effectively
- University capacity planning by analyzing gender-disaggregated graduate numbers to optimize faculty hiring and campus resources
- Corporate HR diversity audits in Bulgaria leveraging census-based tertiary education data to inform inclusive recruitment strategies
- NGO research on brain drain by comparing domestic vs. abroad tertiary education rates among Bulgarian citizens for diaspora engagement initiatives
- Academic social science studies of educational inequality, using exact census figures to support peer-reviewed publications and grant proposals
- EdTech product development and marketing segmentation tailored to the proportions of male vs. female tertiary graduates in Bulgaria
- International development benchmarking for EU cohesion fund allocation by contrasting Bulgarian gender education rates with EU member states
- Data journalism and interactive visualization projects illustrating the evolution of Bulgaria’s gender gap in higher education to drive public discourse
