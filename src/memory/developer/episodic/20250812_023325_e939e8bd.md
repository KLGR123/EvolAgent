### Development Step 25: French-Born Technicolor Hollywood Composers of 1976 Montreal Olympics Theme Music

**Description**: Search for composers who worked on the 1976 Montreal Olympics theme music with a focus on identifying any who were born in France and had connections to early Hollywood film studios, particularly those involved in Technicolor productions. Expand the search beyond Pioneer Pictures to include other studios from the 1930s-1940s era that may have employed French-born composers. Look for Olympic fanfares, ceremonial music, or broadcast themes from the 1976 Montreal Games that were composed by French musicians with film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Musicology research for a documentary production team tracing the career of Leo Arnaud and other French-born composers who bridged Hollywood film scoring and the 1976 Montreal Olympics theme
- Archival cataloguing in a national library to index Olympic fanfares by composer nationality and studio affiliation for enhanced discoverability
- Sports broadcasting rights management verifying composer credits and royalty entitlements for Olympic ceremony music in international TV feeds
- Cultural heritage exhibit planning at a museum showcasing the intersection of Technicolor-era film composers and Olympic ceremonial music
- Academic film studies analysis comparing scoring techniques of 1930s–1940s Technicolor studios with mid-1970s Olympic broadcast themes
- Automated metadata enrichment for a music streaming service tagging Olympic fanfares with composer origin, studio history, and era keywords
- Event programming for a concert promoter curating an anniversary gala of 1976 Montreal Olympic music by French Hollywood–trained composers
