### Development Step 4: Find Teal’c’s Response to “Isn’t That Hot?” in YouTube Video

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Extracting and transcribing customer support training videos to locate “Isn’t that required?” questions and capture the trainer’s exact clarifications for building an automated FAQ database
- Processing courtroom hearing recordings to find when attorneys ask “Isn’t that admissible?” and documenting the judge’s precise rulings for legal case management systems
- Analyzing product demo webinars to identify “Isn’t that expensive?” viewer queries and extract the presenter’s detailed cost‐benefit responses for marketing collateral
- Indexing academic lecture videos to transcribe moments when students ask “Isn’t that assumption flawed?” and record the professor’s counterarguments for online course summaries
- Reviewing medical conference sessions to locate “Isn’t that harmful?” audience concerns and capture the expert’s exact explanations for compliance documentation
- Localizing film trailers by transcribing “Isn’t that dramatic?” taglines and extracting actors’ follow‐up lines to generate accurate subtitles and dubbing scripts
- Auditing internal compliance briefing videos to find “Isn’t that mandatory?” employee queries and preserve the compliance officer’s responses for policy enforcement records
