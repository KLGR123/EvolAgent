### Development Step 36: List Pre-1999 Fiona Apple and Paula Cole Albums Missing Christgau Letter Grades

**Description**: Analyze the research results from workspace/christgau_comprehensive_final_complete_20250803_040620.json to determine which pre-1999 Fiona Apple and Paula Cole albums did NOT receive letter grades from Robert Christgau. Cross-reference the complete list of pre-1999 albums identified earlier with the Christgau review findings to identify albums that were either not reviewed or did not receive letter grades. Create the final alphabetized, comma-delimited list of album titles that didn't receive Christgau letter grades.

**Use Cases**:
- Music librarian cross-referencing album metadata with Christgauâ€™s archives to flag pre-1999 Fiona Apple and Paula Cole albums lacking critical letter grades for catalog completeness
- Digital music streaming service data curation team automating enrichment of album metadata by identifying pre-1999 titles without Christgau grades for targeted content recommendations
- Academic musicology researcher compiling a dataset of unreviewed pre-1999 albums by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole to study underrepresented critical reception trends
- Independent music blogger generating a list of neglected pre-1999 albums without Christgau reviews to inspire specialized review articles and blog posts
- Record label archival department auditing legacy releases to ensure all pre-1999 Fiona Apple and Paula Cole albums are matched with critical assessments, highlighting gaps for press kit updates
- Discography maintainer for a fan-run music website producing an alphabetized, comma-delimited list of albums missing Christgau letter grades to complete their online catalog
- Data engineer at a music metadata platform automating the detection of missing critical review grades, feeding this data into their recommendation engine to surface overlooked albums
- AI-driven playlist curator identifying under-reviewed pre-1999 tracks by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole to diversify playlist selections and spotlight underrated music
