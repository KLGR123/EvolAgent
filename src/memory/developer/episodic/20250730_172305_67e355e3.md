### Development Step 23: Cities of Santa Clara University (Westernmost) and UMass Boston (Easternmost)

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- Government education department performing regional resource allocation by identifying the westernmost and easternmost public universities for budget planning
- University admissions software integrating coastal campus data to personalize outreach campaigns targeting prospective students at extreme geographic points
- Real estate analytics platform mapping student housing demand by analyzing the furthest west and east campus locations
- Travel agency automating college tour itinerary creation that starts at the westernmost university and concludes at the easternmost campus
- EdTech scheduling system adjusting live online class times based on the time zones of partner universities at geographic extremes
- Academic researchers conducting comparative studies on curricular outcomes at institutions located at the continental edges
- Marketing analytics team segmenting digital ad campaigns for online courses by leveraging the geographic extremes of partner universities
