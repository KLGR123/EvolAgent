### Development Step 4: Identify two major tax cut acts Jeff Sessions voted for during his 1997–2017 Senate tenure

**Description**: Research Jeff Sessions' voting record during his time as U.S. Senator to identify the two major tax cut acts he voted for. Focus on significant tax legislation that Sessions supported during his Senate tenure from 1997-2017, particularly major tax cut bills that would be considered landmark legislation.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated legislative trend analysis for a financial services firm to assess tax policy risk exposure based on senators’ historical voting records
- Compliance monitoring tool for a lobbying firm that tracks key votes on major tax bills and generates client briefings
- Political science research pipeline that aggregates, analyzes, and visualizes senator voting behavior on landmark fiscal legislation
- Newsroom fact-checking assistant that quickly identifies how lawmakers voted on significant tax acts for real-time reporting
- Congressional staffer dashboard that compiles vote histories and confidence scores to prepare policy memos for senior legislators
- Nonprofit advocacy platform feature that highlights elected officials’ support for major tax cuts to inform grassroots campaigns
- Law firm due diligence module that examines voting records on tax legislation when advising clients on government contracts
- University civics course tool that automatically collects and summarizes senator votes on tax reform bills for classroom case studies
