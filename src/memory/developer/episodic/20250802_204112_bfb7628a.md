### Development Step 52: Extract 2011 Bulgarian Census Tertiary Education Completion Numbers by Gender

**Description**: Extract the specific tertiary education completion data by gender from the downloaded Census2011final_en.pdf file in the workspace. Parse the document to locate the section containing tertiary education graduates by educational-qualification degree and sex, then extract the exact numbers of men and women who completed tertiary education according to the 2011 Bulgarian census.

**Use Cases**:
- Government policy analytics for the Bulgarian Ministry of Education to adjust funding based on male and female tertiary graduate counts
- Non-profit gender equality NGO designing targeted scholarship programs using male/female graduate statistics from the 2011 census
- Academic sociological research quantifying gender disparities in Bulgarian higher education for longitudinal studies
- Data journalism investigating and visualizing gender-based educational attainment in major news outlets
- UNESCO and other international development agencies comparing Bulgarian gendered tertiary graduation metrics with regional peers
- Educational consulting firms creating market reports on gender composition of university graduates to advise career services
- Corporate diversity and inclusion teams analyzing local graduate demographics to tailor university recruitment strategies
- Machine learning engineers preprocessing gender-specific census education data to develop predictive models for educational outcomes
