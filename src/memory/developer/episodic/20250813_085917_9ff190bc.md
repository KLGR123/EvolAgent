### Development Step 21: Identify the Illustrator of ‘Little Monsters’ Comic and Their Writer Collaborations

**Description**: Search for information about the comic book 'Little Monsters' to identify its illustrator/artist. Focus on finding the artist who illustrated this comic and any information about their collaborations with writers. Look for official publication details, creator credits, and any collaborative relationships mentioned in connection with this work.

**Use Cases**:
- Comic publisher metadata QA: automating extraction of “Little Monsters” illustrator credits from JSON/HTML sources to validate catalog entries before print and digital release
- Online retailer product enrichment: scraping and consolidating artist information for “Little Monsters” listings on e‐commerce platforms like MyComicShop to improve product descriptions
- Library and archive metadata automation: batch‐processing workspace files to update digital catalog records with accurate creator attributions for comic book collections
- Legal licensing verification: gathering illustrator and writer credit details from existing data and HTML references to support IP clearance and contract negotiations for reprints
- Fan‐run database synchronization: automatically updating community wikis and fan sites with verified artist‐writer collaboration info for “Little Monsters” based on consolidated JSON findings
- Academic comics scholarship: mining publication metadata from JSON and HTML to map illustrator‐writer collaboration networks and inform research in comic book studies
- Marketing personalization for comics: extracting the “Little Monsters” artist name to tailor targeted promotional content and social media ads highlighting the illustrator’s work
