### Development Step 1: Analyzing Unlambda Syntax to Output “For Penguins”

**Description**: Research and analyze the Unlambda programming language to understand its syntax, specifically focusing on code structure that would output text strings like "For penguins".

**Use Cases**:
- Esolang blogger automates the collection and formatting of Unlambda language references and examples for a detailed tutorial post
- University computer science instructor generating lecture materials and sample Unlambda programs to illustrate combinator calculus in a functional programming course
- Software documentation team compiling a syntax cheat sheet of Unlambda by scraping official and community sources to include in an internal developers’ wiki
- Data science researcher building a dataset of esoteric language code snippets, including Unlambda, for training AI models on unconventional syntax
- Open-source community manager monitoring GitHub repositories for Unlambda usage to identify active projects and contributors for sponsorship opportunities
- Automated code review pipeline detecting the use of Unlambda snippets in pull requests, extracting them for style consistency and compliance checks
- Digital humanities researcher cataloging historical esoteric programming languages by scraping and analyzing Unlambda documentation across multiple languages
- Coding challenge platform generating and validating Unlambda-based puzzles by creating sample programs that output specific strings like “For penguins”
