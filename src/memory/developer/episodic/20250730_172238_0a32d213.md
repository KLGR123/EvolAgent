### Development Step 22: Cities of Santa Clara University and UMass Boston in West-to-East Order

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- Campus visit itinerary automation for a higher education consulting firm, generating travel routes between Santa Clara and Boston campuses
- Geospatial visualization in an academic research project, mapping the westernmost and easternmost university sites on a US longitudinal axis
- Targeted marketing campaign setup in a university admissions office, using city list to segment email outreach for Californian and Massachusetts prospects
- Student housing demand analysis by a real estate developer, assessing investment opportunities at the geographic extremes of university locations
- Logistics planning for campus merchandise distribution, optimizing cross-country shipping routes between Santa Clara and Boston
- State education department dashboard integration, displaying enrollment and funding comparisons for westernmost versus easternmost public universities
- GIS database population for a location-based services startup, importing extreme campus city coordinates to enhance regional search results
- Automated reporting in a business intelligence system, pulling westernmost and easternmost campus cities into quarterly higher education market trend summaries
