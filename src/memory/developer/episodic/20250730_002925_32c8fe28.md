### Development Step 8: Identify the first name appearing in Holabird & Roche’s firm title as of June 2023

**Description**: Research the architectural firm Holabird & Roche to determine the first name appearing in the firm's name as of June 2023. Focus on finding: (1) The complete firm name and any variations or successors, (2) The chronological order of names in the firm title, (3) Verify the firm's status and naming convention as of June 2023, (4) Confirm which name appears first alphabetically or positionally in the official firm designation. Look for the firm's current website, professional directories, architectural databases, and recent project listings to establish the exact naming format used in 2023.

**Use Cases**:
- M&A legal due diligence automation: verifying the official firm name and first partner’s name from multiple sources to ensure accurate representation in transaction documents
- Architectural heritage research and metadata tagging: extracting and validating founding architects’ names from firm records to enrich historical building databases
- Corporate branding compliance monitoring: automated validation of current and historical firm naming conventions for marketing and branding teams
- Real estate development contract validation: confirming active architectural firm details and lead architect’s name for accurate contractual references
- Professional directory data enrichment: automated extraction of firm names and primary partners from online sources to maintain up-to-date architect listings
- Content management for architecture firms: dynamic population of website bios and metadata using verified firm name and founder information from official databases
- AI knowledge base curation: integrating validated firm naming and founder data into conversational agents to provide accurate answers on architectural histories
- SEO and schema markup optimization: ensuring website metadata correctly reflects the architectural firm’s official designation and founding partner for improved search visibility
