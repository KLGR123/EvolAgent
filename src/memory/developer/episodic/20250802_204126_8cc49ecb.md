**Description**: Extract the specific tertiary education completion data by gender from the downloaded Census2011final_en.pdf file in the workspace. Parse the document to locate the section containing tertiary education graduates by educational-qualification degree and sex, then extract the exact numbers of men and women who completed tertiary education according to the 2011 Bulgarian census.

**Use Cases**:
- Government policy analysis and budget allocation for gender-balanced higher education initiatives in Bulgaria
- NGO program evaluation for monitoring improvements in tertiary education gender parity across different provinces
- Academic demographic research modeling gender-specific educational attainment trends for social science publications
- Corporate talent acquisition strategy planning by analyzing local gender distribution of degree holders for new regional offices
- University career services refining workshop content based on regional male/female graduate statistics to boost employability
- Market research for edtech product development targeting underrepresented gender segments in Bulgaria‚Äôs higher education system
- Urban planning and student housing development informed by the geographical distribution of male and female tertiary graduates
