### Development Step 12: Search player known for unique walk nickname, 29 steals in 1970, 1971 Tommy McCraw trade

**Description**: Search for information about a baseball player who had an unusual walk style nickname, stole 29 bases in the 1970 season, and was involved in a trade between the Chicago White Sox and another team in 1971 where Tommy McCraw was exchanged. Focus on identifying this player's distinctive nickname related to his walking style, his 1970 season statistics showing exactly 29 stolen bases, and the specific 1971 trade details involving McCraw going to the team that had previously traded this player to the White Sox.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports history research and automated verification of player transaction timelines for baseball historians
- Sports analytics pipeline ingestion and validation of career statistical records and 1971 trade events
- Journalism fact-checking of historical baseball transactions, stolen base metrics, and player nicknames
- Fantasy sports platform integration of accurate historical player movement and stolen base statistics
- Digital museum curation of baseball artifacts enhanced with player nickname and trade metadata
- Broadcast production preparation for historical game segments with confirmed trade details and player profiles
- Academic sports science studies on athlete career trajectories using scraped transaction and performance data
- Licensing and compliance audit of player rights and team associations based on transaction histories
