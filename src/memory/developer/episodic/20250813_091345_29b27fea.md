### Development Step 55: Alternative Strategies to Identify Little Monsters Artist and Their Collaboration Chains

**Description**: Search for alternative approaches to identify the Little Monsters artist and their collaborations. Since the Gold Key Comics documentation was limited, explore: (1) Modern Little Monsters series by Jeff Lemire and Dustin Nguyen from Image Comics (2022) to see if this creates the collaboration chain, (2) Search for any other comics titled 'Little Monsters' from different publishers or time periods, (3) Look for Jeff Lemire's collaborations with artists other than Andrea Sorrentino who might connect to Star Trek creators, (4) Search for alternative Star Trek comics featuring symbiotic relationships that might have different creators who connect to the Lemire network.

**Use Cases**:
- Independent comics historian verifying the creative lineage of Little Monsters artists and collaborators to support published bibliographies
- Digital archivist enriching a comic book metadata repository by cross-referencing Jeff Lemire, Dustin Nguyen, and Star Trek collaboration data from multiple web sources
- Entertainment lawyer tracing collaboration networks between modern comic artists and established franchises like Star Trek to assess licensing and royalty claims
- Academic researcher studying industry-wide co-creation patterns by programmatically extracting artist-series connections across different publishers and eras
- Fan site curator automating discovery of new artist-series links to generate up-to-date profiles and collaboration timelines for specialty comics communities
- Publishing data analyst integrating web-scraped results with in-house records to identify missing artist attributions on variant covers and reprint editions
- Licensing manager using scripted searches to uncover crossover opportunities between indie comic creators and major franchises for merchandise and media tie-ins
- IP compliance officer conducting automated pattern matching across online archives to ensure proper crediting of artists and prevent infringement in digital re-releases
