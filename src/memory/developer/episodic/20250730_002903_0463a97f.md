### Development Step 7: Identify First Name in Holabird & Roche Firm Title and Variations as of June 2023

**Description**: Research the architectural firm Holabird & Roche to determine the first name appearing in the firm's name as of June 2023. Focus on finding: (1) The complete firm name and any variations or successors, (2) The chronological order of names in the firm title, (3) Verify the firm's status and naming convention as of June 2023, (4) Confirm which name appears first alphabetically or positionally in the official firm designation. Look for the firm's current website, professional directories, architectural databases, and recent project listings to establish the exact naming format used in 2023.

**Use Cases**:
- Architectural heritage management: automating the extraction of founding architect first names (e.g., “William” from Holabird & Root) when cataloging historic Chicago buildings in a digital preservation database
- Legal due diligence for mergers and acquisitions: parsing historical firm titles to confirm partner identities and ensure accurate naming conventions in transaction documents
- Museum exhibit curation: generating founder biographies by programmatically extracting first names from archival architectural firm names for exhibit labels and multimedia displays
- Marketing automation for industry conferences: populating speaker and sponsor profiles with correct founder first names by analyzing firm names in registration data
- Academic publishing workflow: integrating a script to pull principal architect first names from firm titles for citation footnotes in urban design and architectural history journals
- Real estate property management: tagging building portfolios with founding architect first names to enrich maintenance records and promotional brochures for heritage properties
- CRM data enrichment in the AEC sector: automatically appending founders’ first names to architectural firm records in customer databases to enable personalized outreach and relationship tracking
