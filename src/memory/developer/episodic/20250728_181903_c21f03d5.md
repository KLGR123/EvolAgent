### Development Step 3: Greedy Algorithm for Minimizing 4-Mile Cell Tower Coverage for Seven Houses

**Description**: Solve the minimum cell phone tower coverage optimization problem using the analyzed house positions from data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt. Apply the greedy algorithm approach for the interval covering problem: (1) Convert each house position to a coverage interval showing all possible tower locations that can reach that house within 4-mile radius, (2) Sort intervals by their end points, (3) Use greedy selection to find minimum towers by repeatedly choosing the rightmost position that covers the leftmost uncovered house, (4) Verify the solution covers all 7 houses and calculate the final minimum number of towers needed.

**Use Cases**:
- Telecom operator planning suburban network expansion by determining precise cell tower locations within a 4-mile radius to cover all neighborhoods with minimal towers
- Emergency relief planners optimizing placement of mobile communication units around a hurricane-impacted coastline to ensure all field command centers are within signal range
- Rural broadband project computing optimal wireless hotspot installations to connect isolated farmhouses within a 4-mile coverage radius while reducing setup costs
- Smart city initiative designing public Wi-Fi kiosk positions to cover residential zones and municipal facilities using the smallest number of installations
- Wildlife conservation research deploying remote sensor towers across a forest reserve to monitor animal tracking devices with minimal infrastructure
- Energy provider mapping smart meter repeater stations to guarantee every customer meter lies within a 4-mile communication interval, minimizing equipment
- Outdoor event organizer arranging temporary cell sites at a music festival to ensure coverage of all vendor booths and stages with the least number of towers
- Agricultural IoT network configuring gateway node positions to cover distributed soil moisture sensors within 4-mile intervals, optimizing hardware usage
