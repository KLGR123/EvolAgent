### Development Step 8: Extract 2020 Chinstrap Penguin Population Count and Methodology from Nature.com Study for Comparison

**Description**: Search for and access the Nature.com article titled 'global population assessment of the Chinstrap penguin' from 2020. Extract the specific population figure from this study, noting whether it's provided as breeding pairs or individual penguins. Document the exact methodology and population count to enable accurate comparison with the Wikipedia 2018 data.

**Use Cases**:
- Conservation NGO population tracking dashboards and policy recommendation reports for Antarctic wildlife management
- Government environmental agency species status assessments and legislative drafting for marine protection
- Academic meta-analysis combining multi-decade seabird population studies for climate change impact research
- Automated update of biodiversity informatics platforms (e.g., GBIF) with standardized species counts and confidence intervals
- Ecotourism operator planning and risk assessment for Antarctic expeditions based on up-to-date penguin colony sizes
- Science education module development and interactive visualizations for university ecology courses
- Journalistic data-driven articles on wildlife biodiversity trends for environmental news outlets
- Environmental consultancy feasibility studies and impact assessments for proposed Antarctic infrastructure projects
