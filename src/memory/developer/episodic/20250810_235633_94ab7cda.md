### Development Step 2: Identify All MBTA Franklin-Foxboro Line Stops from South Station to Windsor Gardens (May 2023)

**Description**: Search for current MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line information as of May 2023 to identify all stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens. Focus on finding official MBTA route maps, schedules, or station listings that show the complete sequence of stations on the Franklin-Foxboro line during that time period.

**Use Cases**:
- Transportation planning for a local government agency assessing commuter rail accessibility between Boston and suburban communities in May 2023
- Real estate market analysis to identify properties within walking distance of Franklin-Foxboro line stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens
- Mobile app development for a transit navigation tool that displays all MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line stops and route details for riders
- Academic research on public transit usage patterns, requiring accurate stop sequences for survey design and data collection
- Automated schedule update system for a university shuttle service that coordinates with MBTA train arrivals at Windsor Gardens
- Travel agency itinerary planning for group tours, ensuring all relevant train stops are included between Boston and Windsor Gardens
- Emergency response route mapping for first responders needing precise station locations along the Franklin-Foxboro line
- Accessibility audit by a disability advocacy organization to evaluate station features and platform information between South Station and Windsor Gardens
