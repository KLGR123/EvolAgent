### Development Step 6: Search and Extract Common Two-Word Model in 2018–2019 Customer Retention Studies by Kashyap and Fader

**Description**: Conduct a focused academic literature search for research papers on customer retention studies published during 2018-2019 by authors Manash Pratim Kashyap and PS Fader. Use academic search engines like Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or academic databases. Focus the search on terms like 'Manash Pratim Kashyap customer retention 2018-2019' and 'PS Fader customer retention 2018-2019'. Extract information about the models used in their respective studies, looking specifically for any common two-word model type mentioned in both authors' works.

**Use Cases**:
- Marketing analytics team automating extraction of customer retention models from Kashyap and Fader’s papers to benchmark and optimize loyalty campaigns
- University research group conducting a systematic review of 2018–2019 retention studies to compare Pareto/NBD and hazard-based approaches for a doctoral thesis
- CRM software developers integrating top two-word retention algorithms identified in peer-reviewed work (e.g., “Pareto NBD”, “Hazard Model”) for in-app churn predictions
- Business intelligence analysts building a curated database of customer retention methodologies used by leading authors to inform quarterly strategy reviews
- Subscription service product managers validating common forecasting models across Kashyap and Fader’s studies before launching a new usage-based pricing feature
- Academic librarians generating subject-specific model taxonomies from recent literature to support graduate students in marketing analytics courses
- Data science consultancy performing a competitive audit of industry-standard retention techniques by extracting model mentions from key research papers
- E-commerce operations team automatically scanning and summarizing customer retention research to update segmentation rules for targeted promotions
