### Development Step 2: Find the Oldest Closed numpy.polynomial Issue with Regression Label and Label Addition Timestamp

**Description**: Search GitHub for numpy.polynomial issues to identify all closed issues that have the 'Regression' label. Focus on finding the oldest closed issue with this label and determine when the 'Regression' label was added to that specific issue. Use GitHub's issue search functionality with filters for repository 'numpy/numpy', path 'polynomial', status 'closed', and label 'Regression'. Extract the issue creation date, closure date, and label addition timestamp for the oldest matching issue.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated monitoring of regression label additions in the NumPy polynomial module to alert a quantitative trading team when numerical algorithms may have introduced calculation errors
- Academic research project tracking the timeline of bug fixes in polynomial regression functions for a published study on statistical modeling reproducibility
- DevOps pipeline integration that scans closed GitHub issues with “Regression” labels to enforce SLA compliance on bug resolution times for a data analytics platform
- Quality assurance dashboard for a scientific computing company that aggregates the oldest regression issues and label timestamps to prioritize backport testing
- Open‐source project governance report summarizing how long it takes maintainers to tag and close regression defects in core mathematical functions
- Technical documentation workflow that automatically extracts creation, closure, and label‐addition dates for regression issues to generate an accurate changelog for release notes
- Risk management audit for a machine‐learning service that validates no untracked regressions occurred in polynomial feature generation before production deployment
- Customer support toolkit that identifies when a regression label was applied to a reported polynomial issue, helping support engineers correlate bug fixes with user impact tickets
