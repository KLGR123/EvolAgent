### Development Step 11: Search Reliable Sources to Confirm Greg Chappell‚Äôs Death Date and Year

**Description**: Search for information about when Greg Chappell passed away. Focus on finding his death date and year, using search terms including 'Greg Chappell death date', 'Greg Chappell died year', 'Greg Chappell obituary', and 'Greg Chappell Australian cricketer death'. Verify the information from reliable sources such as cricket databases, news archives, or official cricket organizations.

**Use Cases**:

- Genealogy research platform verifying ancestor life status using HTML scrapers to extract death dates from historical records, obituaries, and cemetery registries
- Legal due diligence tool for corporate compliance that crawls public filings, court records, and online archives to confirm whether key executives or stakeholders are deceased
- Insurance claims automation system validating claimant death by analyzing news articles, obituaries, and social media streams for death indicators before approving benefit payouts
- Journalistic fact-checking pipeline cross-referencing cricket databases, archived web pages, and newswire feeds to confirm the current status of sports legends prior to publishing retrospectives
- Digital archive integrity audit solution that processes HTML and JSON metadata to ensure biographical information on historical figures reflects correct death years and living status
- AI-enhanced CRM enrichment for financial advisors that flags deceased contacts by crawling online mentions, obituaries, and news feeds to maintain accurate client lists
- Academic reference management software that auto-checks author death dates in digital libraries, news archives, and professional databases to categorize sources in historical research publications
