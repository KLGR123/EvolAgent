### Development Step 34: Locate Komodo’s defeating weapon in Green Arrow’s ‘The Kill Machine’ and its recovery comics creators

**Description**: Search for information about Green Arrow's storyline 'The Kill Machine' to identify the weapon used to defeat Komodo and then find comic books that feature the recovery of this specific weapon. Focus on identifying the artist and writer who worked on comics involving this weapon recovery, as this will help establish one part of the collaboration chain described in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated comic lore aggregation for a publisher’s editorial team, extracting storyline details (titles, issues, creators) to plan anniversary reprints and new collections
- Pop-culture research data mining in academia, compiling character weapon symbolism and creator contributions across multiple series for a journal paper
- Digital content pipeline for a fan-driven mobile app, scraping and updating storyline summaries, weapon origins, and collaboration histories in real time
- Rights and licensing dashboard for IP lawyers, mapping writer/artist collaborations and weapon usage across comic arcs to clear merchandising deals
- E-commerce recommendation engine for comic retailers, correlating specific storylines (“The Kill Machine”) and weapon artifacts (Robert Queen’s Bow) with purchase histories
- Marketing campaign automation for a comic convention, generating social media posts highlighting key creators (Lemire, Sorrentino, Maiolo) and pivotal weapon recovery storylines
- Archival metadata enhancement for a library’s graphic novel collection, enriching catalog records with detailed issue summaries, creator credits, and thematic weapon connections
