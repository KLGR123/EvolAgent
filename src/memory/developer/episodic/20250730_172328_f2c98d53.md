### Development Step 24: Cities of Westernmost and Easternmost Universities: Santa Clara University, UMass Boston

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- University admissions geospatial outreach optimization by automatically identifying the westernmost and easternmost campuses (Santa Clara, Boston) for region-specific marketing materials
- Logistics planning for shipping orientation kits to farthest-west and farthest-east university locations, ensuring efficient routing and cost estimates
- Campus tour mobile app backend setup that uses the two boundary cities to generate full cross-country campus visit itineraries
- Academic research on longitudinal diversity trends using the script to pinpoint geographic extremes among participating universities
- Marketing team regional ad spend allocation by targeting student populations at the westernmost and easternmost campuses
- Data science course demonstration of real-world CSV parsing and coordinate-based sorting, using university longitude data as the example
- State education department reporting tool to visualize the geographic spread of public universities, highlighting Santa Clara and Boston as boundary cases
