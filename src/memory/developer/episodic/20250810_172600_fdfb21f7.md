### Development Step 1: Indianaâ€™s First Governor and 23.6-Mile I-65 Section: Dedication Date and County Location

**Description**: Research Indiana's first governor to identify who this person was, then search for information about a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 that was named in their honor. Focus on finding when the Indiana legislative body passed the resolution to designate this highway section. Additionally, identify which Indiana county was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 to determine the specific location of this Interstate 65 section.

**Use Cases**:
- Local history digital archive curation and highway naming timeline verification for state archives departments
- State transportation department resolution tracking and GIS tagging of memorial highways for infrastructure management
- Tourism board historical tours planning and digital mapping of commemoration routes for travel guide apps
- University history department archival research and dataset creation for Indiana statehood and infrastructure studies
- Legislative affairs monitoring and automated retrieval of statutes and resolutions for policymaker briefing reports
- Nonprofit heritage society documentation and interactive web mapping for commemorative highway markers
- Journalism deep-dive into regional history and factual verification for investigative news features on state memorial roads
- Educational technology platform content generation and fact-checking for interactive textbooks on Indiana history
