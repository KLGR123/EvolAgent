- Historical biography research for an academic writing a political figure‚Äôs life story who needs to confirm death circumstances from primary and secondary sources
- Genealogical record verification by a family historian compiling a multi-generational tree requiring precise death dates and causes in archival data
- Public health data aggregation by a healthcare analyst extracting and summarizing death cause mentions from news archives to identify epidemiological trends
- Legal estate settlement by a law firm cross-referencing death records and obituaries to validate client death details before executing wills and inheritance plans
- Digital library archiving by a metadata librarian automating extraction of obituaries and death summaries for a growing online historical repository
- NLP model training dataset curation by a data scientist labeling unstructured text on death causes to improve automated cause-of-death classification tools
