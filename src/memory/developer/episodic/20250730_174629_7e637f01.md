### Development Step 2: Identify the First Place Mentioned in the Book of Esther (NIV)

**Description**: Perform a search to identify the first place mentioned by name in the Book of Esther in the New International Version (NIV) of the Bible. Use Bible reference websites or online Bible resources to locate and read the beginning of the Book of Esther in the NIV translation specifically.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated geographic index generation for Bible software to map the locations mentioned in each book for cartographers and educators
- Theological research automation for extracting and comparing place references across multiple Bible translations in academic studies
- Church sermon preparation tools that fetch Esther passages and highlight the first geographical location to illustrate historical and thematic context
- Educational e-learning platforms generating interactive quizzes and world maps by automatically identifying and plotting biblical place names from the text
- Digital humanities projects performing large-scale NLP-based entity extraction on religious texts to analyze geographic reference patterns over time
- QA automation for Bible translation verification workflows, ensuring that place names like “India” and “Susa” are correctly rendered and positioned
- Christian tourism agencies generating guided tour itineraries by extracting and mapping early scriptural location mentions for pilgrimage planning
- Mobile Bible study apps enhancing user engagement by fetching verses and contextualizing the first place mentioned with images and background information
