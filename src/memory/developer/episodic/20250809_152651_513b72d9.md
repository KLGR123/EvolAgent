### Development Step 9: Which Trump AG Sessions or Barr Voted for 2006 Senate Reauthorization of H.R. 9?

**Description**: Research the voting records and legislative activities of Jeff Sessions and William Barr (the two confirmed U.S. Attorneys General under Trump) to identify which one voted in favor of H.R. 9 (109th Congress) that was reauthorized in 2006 and passed by a 98-0 Senate vote. Focus on their Senate voting histories since this bill required a Senate vote.

**Use Cases**:
- Political campaign analytics: tracking senators’ roll call votes on landmark bills like H.R. 9 to inform targeted voter outreach and ad spend decisions
- Academic public policy research: aggregating and visualizing historical Senate voting records on civil rights and election law for journal articles and case studies
- Investigative journalism: automating extraction and cross-referencing of roll call data to fact-check legislators’ public statements about their voting history
- Advocacy coalition monitoring: real-time alerts and dashboards showing how state senators vote on priority issues, enabling rapid response campaigning
- Civic tech engagement: citizen-facing portals that allow constituents to query their representatives’ voting records on major legislation like H.R. 9
- Legal due diligence: analyzing federal appointees’ prior legislative service and voting patterns to assess regulatory risks for corporate clients
- Regulatory compliance teams: tracking legislative trends and unanimous votes in Congress to forecast policy shifts affecting industry regulation
- Data-driven election forecasting: incorporating individual senator voting profiles into predictive models to anticipate support for future legislative initiatives
