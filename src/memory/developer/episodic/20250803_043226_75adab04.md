### Development Step 3: Identify Earliest Year Apple (AAPL) Stock Surpassed $50 Unadjusted on Google Finance

**Description**: Search Google Finance for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price historical data to identify the first year when Apple's stock price exceeded $50 per share without adjusting for stock splits. Access Google Finance directly or use web search to find Apple's historical stock price charts and data, focusing on identifying the earliest date when the stock crossed the $50 threshold in its original, non-split-adjusted form.

**Use Cases**:
- Investment banking equity research teams verifying Apple’s non-split-adjusted $50 milestone to support client presentations on historical performance
- Hedge fund quants backtesting trading algorithms that trigger on first-time price thresh­olds without split adjustments
- Personal finance bloggers illustrating the impact of stock splits by pinpointing when AAPL originally crossed $50 in reader-friendly articles
- Corporate treasury departments benchmarking share repurchase timing against historical price milestones for internal performance reviews
- University finance professors creating real-world case studies on IPO growth and split timing for MBA coursework
- Fintech data engineers building automated pipelines to fetch and normalize historical stock events for analytics dashboards
- Regulatory compliance officers auditing historical disclosures to ensure accurate representation of past share price thresholds in SEC filings
- Wealth management platforms generating milestone-based client reports showing when high-net-worth portfolios first held $50-level Apple shares
