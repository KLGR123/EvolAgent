### Development Step 6: Verify 2011 Extractive Metallurgy Book Covers Lithium-Salt Calcination and Two-Stage Bioleaching Methods

**Description**: Verify the identified 2011 Elsevier publication 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by conducting a targeted search to confirm it specifically covers both the calcination process with lithium salts for recovering metals from spent automotive catalysts AND the two-stage bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for low-grade cobalt ores. Search for the book's table of contents, chapter summaries, or detailed reviews that explicitly mention these two specific processes. Cross-reference with academic databases, publisher catalogs, and technical literature citations to ensure this publication contains both required methodologies described in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Patent prior-art verification and targeted confirmation of lithium-salt calcination and bioleaching methods in chemical patent examinations
- Battery recycling R&D literature validation and extraction of calcination with lithium salts for spent automotive catalyst recovery processes
- Metallurgical process adoption risk assessment and cross-referencing of two-stage Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bioleaching protocols in industrial scale-up proposals
- Academic grant proposal due diligence with automated searches to confirm cited Elsevier references include both nickel‚Äìcobalt recovery techniques
- Environmental consultancy remediation planning and auditing of published process descriptions for spent catalyst treatment and cobalt ore leaching
- University thesis committee automated reference auditing to ensure textbooks cited in graduate research actually cover specified calcination and bioleaching methods
- Systematic review authors‚Äô bibliometric analysis and methodology mapping of extractive metallurgy approaches across multiple academic and publisher catalogs
