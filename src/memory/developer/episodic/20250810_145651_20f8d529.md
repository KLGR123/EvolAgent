### Development Step 17: Search and Verify Greg Chappell‚Äôs Death Date and Year from Reliable Cricket Sources

**Description**: Search for information about when Greg Chappell passed away. Focus on finding his death date and year, using search terms including 'Greg Chappell death date', 'Greg Chappell died year', 'Greg Chappell obituary', and 'Greg Chappell Australian cricketer death'. Verify the information from reliable sources such as cricket databases, news archives, or official cricket organizations.

**Use Cases**:
- Newsroom editorial teams verifying the death status and obituary details of public figures (actors, politicians) before publishing breaking news to prevent spreading misinformation
- Genealogical research platforms cross-referencing historical records and obituaries to accurately determine death dates of individuals with common names for family tree validation
- Insurance fraud detection systems automating death verification against official databases and news archives to validate life insurance claims and prevent false payouts
- Corporate due diligence processes confirming the living status of key executives and board members of acquisition targets to ensure leadership continuity and minimize legal risks
- Academic publishers validating reported death dates of scholars and researchers for accurate metadata in journal articles and institutional repositories
- Social media content moderation tools analyzing user-generated posts about celebrity deaths, verifying mentions against reliable sources to flag or remove potential hoaxes
- Sports statistics databases updating player profiles by verifying the death status of former athletes through official sports organizations and news outlets to maintain historical accuracy
- Human resources background check services automating confirmation of deceased status for candidates with similar names to reduce identity fraud and hiring errors
