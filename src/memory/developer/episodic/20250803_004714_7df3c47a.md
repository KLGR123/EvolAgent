### Development Step 3: Extract Official Land Area Data for Washington State’s 39 County Seats

**Description**: Research and extract the land area data for all 39 Washington state county seats that were identified in the previous step. Use authoritative sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, official city websites, or government geographic databases to obtain the land area measurements for each county seat city. Focus on finding the official land area figures in square miles or square kilometers for accurate comparison.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban planning department conducting comparative density analysis across Washington’s county seats to prioritize transportation infrastructure investments
- Real estate analytics firm integrating precise land area metrics of Washington county seats into property valuation algorithms for accurate market assessments
- Environmental research team assessing urban sprawl by tracking historical land area changes in county seats for conservation impact studies
- Emergency management agency mapping county seat boundaries and land extents to optimize evacuation routes and resource allocation during natural disasters
- Tourism board developing an interactive state map highlighting county seat sizes to tailor regional marketing campaigns and visitor guides
- Education technology provider creating interactive geography modules for students, using official land area data of Washington county seats for quizzes and maps
- Logistics company calculating delivery zone sizes within county seats to optimize last-mile distribution routes and fleet allocation
- Public health department analyzing population density versus land area in county seats to plan vaccination clinic locations and mobile health units
