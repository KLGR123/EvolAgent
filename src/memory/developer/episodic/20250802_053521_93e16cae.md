### Development Step 8: Fetch University of Leicester’s “Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?” PDF

**Description**: Conduct a web search for the University of Leicester paper titled "Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?" and download the full PDF of that paper into workspace/dragon_diet_fish_bag.pdf.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated retrieval of University of Leicester dragon‐diet research PDFs (site:le.ac.uk) to streamline literature reviews in evolutionary biology
- Scheduled download of SEC EDGAR financial filings (site:sec.gov) for quantitative hedge‐fund risk modeling and reporting
- Bulk scraping of ISO standard PDFs (site:iso.org) to maintain up-to-date corporate compliance libraries in manufacturing
- Automated collection of Cisco network architecture whitepapers (site:cisco.com) for enterprise IT teams building infrastructure runbooks
- Periodic fetching of UK Parliament policy papers (site:parliament.uk) to support legal analysts tracking new legislative developments
- Scheduled extraction of clinical trial protocol PDFs (site:clinicaltrials.gov) for meta-analysis in pharmaceutical R&D
- Automated download of Texas Instruments product datasheets (site:ti.com) to update an electronics component inventory management system
- Recurring archiving of United Nations press release PDFs (site:un.org) for NGO media monitoring and sentiment analysis dashboards

print("After examining these files, you can refine the parsing logic to extract the real PDF URL and implement the download step.")
