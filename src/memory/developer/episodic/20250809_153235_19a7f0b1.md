### Development Step 15: Identify 2002 Senate-Repealed Iraq Regime-Change Act & Jeff Sessionsâ€™ 2005 Speech Venue

**Description**: Research the 2002 legislation that was repealed by the U.S. Senate in 2023, had unresolved House legislative status, was co-sponsored by Christopher Cox, aimed to support regime change through opposition groups, and targeted a certain leader. Identify this specific measure that Jeff Sessions spoke in favor of, then determine where he delivered a speech about this legislation in 2005.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated legislative tracking and repeal monitoring for policy analysis firms
- Historical political speech retrieval and venue analysis for academic research projects
- Bulk web scraping and cleaned data extraction of congressional records for legal libraries
- Co-sponsorship network mapping and relationship analysis for non-profit watchdog organizations
- Automated report generation of AUMF statuses and voting patterns for defense think tanks
- Event venue identification and scheduling support for political lobbying groups
- Archival of structured research findings in JSON for digital history and archival platforms
- Integration of legislative and voting data into business intelligence dashboards for advocacy campaigns
