### Development Step 4: Identify Production Company of 1935’s Becky Sharp, the First Full-Length Three-Strip Technicolor Film

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the first full-length color film using three-strip Technicolor titled 'Becky Sharp' and determine which company produced it. Search for keywords including 'Becky Sharp 1935 three-strip Technicolor producer', 'first full-length Technicolor film production company', 'Becky Sharp movie producer studio', and 'three-strip Technicolor Becky Sharp who produced'. Focus on identifying the specific production company or studio that created this pioneering color film to establish which company employed the composer we need to identify.

**Use Cases**:
- Business intelligence competitor profiling using multi-backend web searches to aggregate production and partnership data when primary APIs fail
- Academic literature discovery for film historians by automating keyword-driven searches across DuckDuckGo and other engines to uncover studio archives
- Legal case research automation with fallback search providers to ensure continuous access to court opinions and producer records during API outages
- Journalism fact-checking workflows leveraging redundant search services to verify movie production credits and studio statements in real time
- IT operations incident monitoring that logs API failures, triggers alternative search routines, and archives error logs for post-mortem analysis
- Film and media production research extracting detailed 1930s studio and composer information by orchestrating targeted search queries and relevance scoring
- Marketing sentiment analysis capturing brand mentions across multiple search backends to maintain uninterrupted social data feeds during service disruptions
