### Development Step 3: Identify 2020 documentary on ‘Run Home Slow’ composer: archival 1960s footage, title, director

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the 2020 documentary that includes archival footage from the 1960s and focuses on a composer who wrote the soundtrack for the 1963 B movie 'Run Home Slow'. Search for keywords including '2020 documentary archival footage 1960s composer', 'Run Home Slow 1963 B movie soundtrack composer', 'documentary 2020 composer 1960s footage', and 'Run Home Slow soundtrack who composed'. Focus on identifying both the specific 2020 documentary title and the composer it focuses on, as well as the director of this documentary.

**Use Cases**:
- Film archivists automate extraction of documentary titles, directors, and release years from aggregated web search JSON files to curate museum exhibits on 1960s composers
- Music rights management teams streamline composer attribution and licensing checks for archival footage by parsing search-result snippets programmatically
- Streaming services enrich their catalog metadata by auto-populating documentary details (title, URL, director) from structured web-scrape analyses
- Legal compliance departments audit documentary licensing and royalty obligations by generating validation reports from comprehensive search logs
- Academic researchers perform large-scale literature reviews on music documentaries by extracting key film metadata and director profiles from scraped search data
- Data journalism teams investigate trends in archival footage usage by analyzing search-result patterns for composer names, film years, and archival keywords
- Educational content curators compile targeted classroom modules on historical composers by programmatically identifying relevant documentaries and director information
- Media asset management systems implement automated QA to validate web scraping outputs against JSON schema and business rules for film metadata ingestion
