### Development Step 31: Extract Survivor (US) Seasons 1–44 Winners into JSON File

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series) and extract the table of winners for seasons 1 through 44, saving each season number with its corresponding winner name into workspace/survivor_winners_list.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Survivor fan portal dynamic leaderboards and season recap pages powered by automated winner data extraction
- Reality TV analytics dashboard correlating season winners with viewer ratings and demographic trends for media researchers
- Podcast episode generator for Survivor-focused shows, auto-populating show notes and social posts with the latest winner list
- Trivia mobile app backend that fetches and updates Survivor winner questions by season for daily quiz challenges
- Merchandise design workflow that pulls winner names to create commemorative T-shirt prints and collectible posters each season
- Diversity and representation report in academic studies, using extracted winner data to examine gender and age trends across Survivor’s history
- Marketing campaign automation for anniversary promotions, dynamically inserting winners’ names into email and ad templates
