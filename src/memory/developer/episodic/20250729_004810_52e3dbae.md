### Development Step 4: Checking for a Hamiltonian Cycle in Earlâ€™s 49-Plot Adjacency Graph

**Description**: Solve the Hamiltonian path problem to determine if Earl can walk through every plot he owns exactly once and return to his starting plot without backtracking. Using the identified 49 green plots from the previous analysis, construct a graph where each plot is a node and edges connect adjacent plots (horizontally and vertically neighboring cells). Apply graph theory algorithms to check if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in Earl's connected land area, considering movement constraints between adjacent plots only.

**Use Cases**:
- Agricultural field drone inspection and pesticide application route planning to visit each crop plot exactly once and return to the charging station
- Autonomous warehouse robot inventory audit path design for scanning every storage bin on a grid floor without revisiting aisles
- Robotic vacuum cleaner room mapping and coverage sequencing to clean each floor tile exactly once before docking
- Municipal snowplow street network routing to clear every block in a neighborhood once and return to the depot
- PCB drilling machine head movement optimization to drill all hole locations on a circuit board in a single continuous cycle
- Museum security robot patrol scheduling to traverse all gallery rooms exactly once and end at the control room
- Last-mile delivery drone routing over a city block grid to drop off packages at each address cluster once and circle back
- Smart irrigation system hose routing across greenhouse plots for watering each section without overlap before returning to refill station
