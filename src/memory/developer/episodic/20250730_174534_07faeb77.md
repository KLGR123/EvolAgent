### Development Step 1: Identify the First Place Mentioned in the Book of Esther (NIV)

**Description**: Perform a search to identify the first place mentioned by name in the Book of Esther in the New International Version (NIV) of the Bible. Use Bible reference websites or online Bible resources to locate and read the beginning of the Book of Esther in the NIV translation specifically.

**Use Cases**:
- Biblical app development: automatically extract and index geographic references from the Book of Esther (NIV) to populate an interactive story map in a mobile Bible study application
- Theological seminary research: batch-process multiple biblical books in the NIV translation to build a database of first-mention place names for Old Testament geography courses
- Digital humanities project: integrate regex-based place-name extraction into a text-mining pipeline to analyze location-mention patterns across different Bible translations
- Church presentation automation: generate PowerPoint slides for Sunday school lessons by auto-detecting and annotating the first historical locations in each chapter of Esther
- Academic publishing workflow: embed automated checks in the editorial process to verify the accuracy and consistency of place names in new NIV study Bible editions
- Pilgrimage tour planning: develop an itinerary tool that pulls initial biblical locations from passages to suggest real-world sites for heritage travel agencies specializing in biblical tours
- Chatbot script enhancement: equip a Bible Q&A bot with live lookup of key locations by scraping and parsing online scripture passages for on-demand geographic context
- E-learning assessment generation: auto-create quiz questions and fill-in-the-blank exercises on biblical geography by extracting first-mention place names from the Book of Esther (NIV)
