### Development Step 6: **Title:**  
Extract and Identify Unique and Duplicate Food Items from Excel Inventory Data

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/9b54f9d9-35ee-4a14-b62f-d130ea00317f/food_duplicates.xls to extract all food items listed in the spreadsheet. Identify the complete inventory of food names and examine for any duplicates or variations of the same food item appearing under different names. Create a comprehensive list of all unique food items and identify which single food item appears only once without any duplicate entries or alternative naming variations.

**Use Cases**:
- Restaurant chain menu standardization by identifying duplicate or variant food items across multiple branch inventory spreadsheets
- Food safety audit for hospital kitchens to ensure unique tracking of each ingredient and dish, preventing mislabeling or accidental duplication
- Grocery retailer product catalog cleanup to consolidate similar food items and highlight unique offerings for marketing campaigns
- Nutrition research study data validation to ensure accurate counting of unique foods consumed by participants, eliminating redundancies
- Automated procurement system integration to detect and resolve duplicate food entries before generating supplier orders
- Culinary school curriculum planning to identify unique dishes taught versus repeated or variant recipes in course materials
- Food delivery app backend optimization by deduplicating menu items and ensuring each unique dish is listed only once for users
- Regulatory compliance reporting for food manufacturers to verify that each ingredient is uniquely documented in quality assurance logs
