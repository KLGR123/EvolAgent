### Development Step 8: Title: Identify the Word Deleted in the Most Recent Amendment to Rule 701 on Cornell LII Website

**Description**: Access Rule 701 (Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses) on Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website and examine its complete amendment history to identify the most recent amendment. Extract the specific text changes made in the last amendment to determine what word was deleted from the rule. Focus on comparing the before and after versions of the rule text to identify the exact word that was removed.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal research automation for law firms preparing briefs on admissibility of lay witness testimony, ensuring citation of the most current Rule 701 language
- Compliance auditing in corporate legal departments to verify internal training materials reflect the latest Federal Rules of Evidence amendments
- Academic curriculum development for law schools updating evidence course syllabi and teaching materials to incorporate the 2011 Rule 701 restyling
- Judicial opinion drafting support for court clerks and judges, confirming references to Rule 701 use the amended text and rationale
- Legal publishing workflow for updating annotated rulebooks and digital resources with precise amendment history and deleted terms
- AI-powered legal document review tools that flag outdated references to "inference" in witness testimony sections, prompting revision to match current rule language

print('\nExplanation:')
print('• The word "inference" was deleted from Rule 701 in the 2011 amendment')
print('• This was part of a stylistic restyling effort to improve readability')
print('• The Committee determined that "inference" was redundant since it is covered by the broader term "opinion"')
print('• No substantive change was intended - courts had not made substantive decisions based on distinguishing between "opinion" and "inference"')
print('• The deletion was purely for clarity and flow of the rule text')
