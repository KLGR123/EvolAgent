### Development Step 11: Solve an anagram to reveal a famous 100-letter line from Shakespeareâ€™s Hamlet using all letters.

**Description**: Solve the anagram by rearranging the letters from 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten' to find the original Shakespeare line from Hamlet that this phrase represents. Focus on identifying one of Shakespeare's most well-known lines from the tragedy, ensuring all 100 letters are used exactly once in the rearrangement.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated grading and validation of complex literature puzzles in university English courses, ensuring students' anagram solutions match exact Shakespearean lines
- Digital humanities research for reconstructing and verifying historical texts through letter-frequency-based anagram analysis
- Interactive museum exhibits that allow visitors to solve literary anagram challenges and reveal famous quotes using real-time computational verification
- Quality assurance in educational publishing, checking that literary puzzles and anagrams in textbooks are solvable and correspond to canonical works
- Gamification platforms for literature learning, generating and validating custom anagram challenges based on classic texts for student engagement
- Forensic linguistics investigations, reconstructing possible original phrases from jumbled or corrupted literary evidence using systematic letter analysis
- Automated content creation tools for trivia apps, generating and verifying Shakespearean anagram puzzles with precise letter constraints
- Archival restoration projects, confirming the authenticity of fragmented or rearranged manuscript passages by matching them to known literary sources
