### Development Step 25: Locate Emily Midkiffâ€™s June 2014 Dragon Depictions Article in Journal Named After Hreidmarâ€™s Son

**Description**: Search for information about Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article, focusing on identifying the journal named after one of Hreidmar's sons from Norse mythology. Research Hreidmar's sons (Fafnir, Regin, and Otr) to determine which one has a journal named after them, then locate Midkiff's specific article from June 2014 that discusses dragon depictions and contains quotes from two different authors expressing distaste.

**Use Cases**:
- Competitive intelligence extraction by parsing scraped HTML press releases to count and contextualize mentions of key rival products and extract direct competitor quotes.
- Legal eDiscovery processing of courtroom transcript HTML files to identify and extract contexts around witness names and specific legal terms for rapid case review.
- Customer feedback analysis by scanning exported support ticket HTML logs for recurring complaint keywords, tallying occurrences, and pulling surrounding text for quality improvement.
- Academic literature survey in digital journal archives to locate all instances of a researcherâ€™s name, count article mentions, and extract citation contexts for systematic reviews.
- HR resume screening automation by processing candidate CVs saved as HTML to detect required skill keywords, count their frequency, and extract candidate statements for recruiter summaries.
- Regulatory compliance monitoring by scanning corporate website HTML changes for specific policy terms, flagging frequency spikes, and extracting surrounding policy text for audit teams.
- Journalism content curation by processing multiple interview transcript HTML files to find quotes containing a target subject, count references, and compile soundbites for editorial use.
- Technical documentation audit by parsing API reference HTML pages to locate deprecated method names, tally their usage counts, and extract usage examples for migration planning.
