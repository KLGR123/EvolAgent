### Development Step 8: Count Wikipedia page edits from inception through June 30, 2023

**Description**: Filter the extracted revision data from the comprehensive Wikipedia history to count only the edits made from the page's inception until the end of June 2023. Exclude any revisions that occurred after June 30, 2023, and provide the exact count of edits within the specified timeframe.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical research in digital humanities: quantifying edit frequency of the “World War II” Wikipedia article from creation until June 30, 2023 to study shifts in collective memory
- Crisis communication analysis: counting revisions on the “COVID-19 pandemic” page up to June 2023 to correlate spikes in edits with major outbreak events
- Journalism data visualization: compiling the number of edits on the “United States presidential election” article before July 2023 to illustrate media attention cycles
- Machine learning dataset preparation: selecting only revisions made to the “Climate change” page until mid-2023 to train time-aware text generation models
- Corporate competitive intelligence: tracking edit counts on rival product pages (e.g., “iPhone”) up to June 2023 to gauge public information update frequency
- NGO impact assessment: measuring contribution activity on environmental initiative articles until June 2023 to identify key volunteer editors
- Legal e-discovery and audit: auditing revision counts for contentious biography pages to establish timelines of content changes before July 2023
