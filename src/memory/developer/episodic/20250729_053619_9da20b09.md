### Development Step 9: Identify Legume Wikipedia 2022 Content Violations and ‚ÄòR‚Äô Definition in Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Wikipedia editorial oversight: scanning the Legume article‚Äôs public edit logs to detect instances of biased language (NPOV breaches), unverifiable claims (V), and original research (NOR) in edits made throughout 2022 before December, and producing policy-compliance reports.
- Corporate technical documentation audit: analyzing the revision history of an internal engineering wiki to flag unverified design claims and undocumented research insertions, ensuring all technical content meets the company's reliability standards akin to Reliable Sources.
- Social media content policy enforcement: processing comment and post logs on an online community forum to automatically identify and categorize policy infractions‚Äîsuch as defamation, hate speech, or false statements‚Äîmapping them to core policy codes (e.g., V for Verifiability, NOR for No Original Research) for the moderation team.
- Academic research integrity checks: reviewing student thesis draft revisions on a university‚Äôs digital submission portal to uncover any uncited original research (NOR violations) and confirm all assertions are supported by reliable, peer-reviewed sources (RS).
- Newswire fact-checking automation: ingesting document change logs from a news agency‚Äôs content management system to isolate and report additions lacking credible references or containing editorial bias, tagging violations under corresponding core policies and alerting editors in real time.
- E-commerce product description validation: examining change logs in a marketplace platform where sellers update product information, detecting unverifiable claims (V) or overhyped, unsupported details, and enforcing a neutral, research-backed standard before listing goes live.
- Government policy document review: parsing the version history of municipal policy drafts on an open-data portal to identify any introduction of original analysis or shifts in neutral language (NPOV, NOR violations), and summarizing findings for legal compliance and public transparency teams.
