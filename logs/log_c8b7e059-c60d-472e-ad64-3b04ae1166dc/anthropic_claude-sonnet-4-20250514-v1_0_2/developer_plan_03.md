# Developer Plan 03

## Plan
Conduct a systematic search for Federico Lauria's 2014 dissertation using alternative approaches and verify the footnote 397 reference. Search academic databases, university repositories, and dissertation archives using keywords 'Federico Lauria 2014 dissertation', 'Lauria philosophy dissertation', and variations. If the dissertation cannot be accessed directly, search for any published papers, conference presentations, or academic works by Federico Lauria from 2014 that might contain the same footnote 397 reference. Cross-reference any findings with the Smithsonian American Art Museum collection to identify paintings whose titles derive from the same source work.

## Description
This approach is necessary because: (1) The previous analysis relied on predictions about footnote 397 content rather than accessing the actual dissertation, (2) Michael Smith's 'The Moral Problem' prediction did not yield results in the SAAM collection search, (3) We need to verify the actual work referenced in footnote 397 to conduct an accurate search, (4) This systematic verification approach will provide the correct source material needed to identify the two paintings and calculate the absolute difference between chapter numbers

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 8: Web Search: Valentina Re’s Metalepsis, Horror, Dream Worlds & Reality in World Building (2017)

**Description**: Conduct a web search for the book "World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries" (2017) edited by Marta Boni, focusing on Valentina Re's chapter or contribution. Look specifically for information about metalepsis, horror movies, dream worlds and reality in Valentina Re's work.

**Use Cases**:
- Film studies thesis support by aggregating summaries of Valentina Re’s chapter on metalepsis from Google Books and publisher sites to populate a literature review database
- University library metadata update by scheduling the script to validate and enrich catalog records for "World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries" with accurate ISBN, publisher description, and chapter information
- Academic publisher metadata validation by cross-referencing Google Books API data against the Amsterdam University Press website to ensure accuracy before printing new editions
- Digital course content curation by integrating the solution into an LMS to automatically import key theoretical frameworks and chapter outlines into film theory and transmedia storytelling syllabi
- Academic marketing automation by extracting thematic highlights on horror cinema and dream world representations to generate targeted social media posts and email campaigns promoting the book
- Digital humanities corpus building by scraping multiple edited collections for chapter-level metadata and thematic mentions to create a searchable narrative analysis dataset
- Bibliographic network analysis by converting the JSON outputs into graph visualizations mapping relationships between concepts like metalepsis, genre studies, and diegetic levels across academic publications
- Conference program generation by scraping speaker bios and chapter abstracts to automatically produce session descriptions and booklets for a film theory workshop on world building

### Development Step 2: Search Valentina Re’s Metalepsis in Horror, Dream Worlds, Reality in Boni’s ‘World Building’ (2017)

**Description**: Conduct a web search for the book "World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries" (2017) edited by Marta Boni, focusing on Valentina Re's chapter or contribution. Look specifically for information about metalepsis, horror movies, dream worlds and reality in Valentina Re's work.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated metadata extraction of chapter titles, author contributions, and thematic context from academic anthologies across publisher platforms for a university’s digital repository of transmedia studies
- Building a digital humanities knowledge graph by parsing and linking occurrences of metalepsis, horror motifs, dream sequences, and reality discussions from scholarly sources
- Streamlining academic publishing marketing by scraping and summarizing key insights (e.g., horror movie metalepsis, dream world dynamics) from new edited volumes to generate promotional blurbs and social media posts
- Aggregating contextually relevant quotes about narrative boundaries, metalepsis, and reality disruptions in horror cinema for film studies course preparation, lecture slides, and annotated reading packs
- Powering a scholarly content management system by extracting and tagging author contributions and concept contexts from online repositories (AUP, Google Books, ResearchGate) for advanced search filters and personalized recommendations
- Creating an NLP training corpus by harvesting labeled text snippets around ‘horror’, ‘dreamscape’, ‘reality’, and ‘metalepsis’ to develop genre and thematic classification models
- Automating the integration of JSON-formatted chapter metadata and thematic context excerpts into a university library catalog to enable concept-based discovery of transmedia narratives
- Supporting graduate thesis meta-analysis workflows through automated collection and comparison of ‘reality’ and ‘dream world’ contexts across multiple authors and chapters in transmedia research

**Description**: Search for the academic article 'Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)' by David Greetham published in Textual Cultures: Texts, Contexts, Interpretation, vol. 3 no. 1, 2008, pages 45-46. Use the provided DOI 10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44 to locate the article on Project MUSE or through DOI resolution. Extract the complete text from pages 45-46 to verify if the quoted passage 'obscured not by a "cloak of print" but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission' appears exactly as cited in the bibliography.

**Use Cases**:
- University library digitization team automating bulk DOI resolution and full-text retrieval to build a searchable local archive of historical journal issues
- Journal editorial office running a pre-publication script to confirm each DOI link resolves correctly on Project MUSE and verify quoted passages during copyediting
- Reference management tool plugin for graduate students that fetches article metadata, downloads PDFs, and validates key quotations from bibliographies
- Digital humanities research group extracting specific textual passages across multiple articles to analyze scribal transmission errors in medieval manuscript studies
- University open-access office scanning faculty publications to detect “free access” indicators, retrieve full texts, and update the institutional repository automatically
- Bibliometric analysts harvesting metadata, full-text access links, and citation contexts for large-scale network analysis of scholarly communication patterns
- Patent law firm verifying verbatim quotes from academic articles via DOI resolution and HTML parsing to support prior-art examination and infringement cases
- Research compliance team automating audits of funded project reports to ensure published papers include correct DOIs, accessible full texts, and accurate quoted excerpts

### Development Step 9: Download Westerink’s "A Dark Trace" from Project MUSE and Extract Chapter 2’s Influential Author

**Description**: Access and download the full text of 'A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt' by H. Westerink from Project MUSE using DOI 10.1353/book.24372. Since the book was confirmed to be open access, retrieve the complete text and save it to workspace/dark_trace_freud_book.pdf or appropriate format. Focus on locating and extracting Chapter 2 content to identify the author who influenced Freud's belief in 'endopsychic myths'. If the full book is not directly downloadable, extract Chapter 2 specifically or access the book's table of contents to determine the exact chapter title and content structure.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal due diligence in corporate mergers: automatically download open-access regulatory codes in PDF, search for “antitrust” and “competition” term variations, extract and summarize context to identify potential deal blockers.
- Pharmaceutical literature review automation: fetch clinical trial protocols via DOI, load full-text PDFs, search for “double-blind” and “placebo” mentions, and extract methodological passages along with author names for evidence synthesis.
- Patent portfolio analysis for semiconductor R&D: retrieve patent documents from public repositories, scan PDFs for “heterojunction” and “quantum well” variants, extract inventor citations and contextual explanations to map technology lineage.
- Historical philosophy research on Nietzsche and Kant: access digitized editions of 19th-century works, locate references to “categorical imperative” or “will to power,” and extract surrounding paragraphs to trace cross-author influences.
- Competitive intelligence from SEC filings: download publicly available 10-K and 10-Q reports, search for “risk factor,” “liquidity risk,” and “market volatility” variations, and pull relevant excerpts for financial analysis dashboards.
- Academic curriculum design from open textbooks: ingest complete PDF textbooks via DOIs, locate chapter summaries or “learning objectives” headings, extract and compile structured outlines for course syllabi.
- Investigative journalism document mining: import leaked policy PDFs, search for “whistleblower,” “confidential,” and “internal memo” terms, extract context with names and dates to support storytelling.
- Compliance monitoring in healthcare: load clinical guideline PDFs, scan for “contraindication,” “adverse effect,” and “off-label” variations, and extract detailed sections with authoring bodies for automated policy updates.
