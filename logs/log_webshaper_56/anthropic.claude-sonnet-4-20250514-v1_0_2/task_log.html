Tanner, and early Hollywood or film industry interest in Bond properties.<br><br>Plan Description:<br>This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific Ian Fleming work from 1955 and trace its early film rights history, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to find information about early James Bond film rights deals and identify the person who secured but later relinquished rights due to inability to acquire the full series, (4) This directly targets the unique combination of 1955 timing, Fleming authorship, William S. Tanner character connection, and film rights acquisition/relinquishment needed to identify the person and their profession<br><br>Retrieved Episodic Memory Examples:<br>### Development Step 1: Goldfinger (1964) Finale Concealment Objects and Colors Used by Bond and Pussy Galore<br><br>**Description**: Search for detailed information about the ending of the 1964 James Bond film &#x27;Goldfinger&#x27; starring Sean Connery.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution failed - The code contains a critical variable definition error that prevents proper execution. The error &#x27;name &#x27;combined_text&#x27; is not defined&#x27; occurs because the variable is referenced before being properly defined in the search result processing loop. Additionally, the actual output shows completely unrelated content about UK information, VA disability compensation, and Auburn prison research instead of James Bond film rights research. The code appears to have executed a different search entirely, producing results about Auburn, New York institutions and pension legislation rather than James Bond, Ian Fleming, or 1955 film rights. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no James Bond film rights information was successfully retrieved. The search queries were well-designed but the execution failed due to the variable error and possibly incorrect search execution. Recommended fixes: (1) Fix the &#x27;combined_text&#x27; variable definition error in the result processing loop, (2) Debug why the search is returning unrelated Auburn/pension results instead of James Bond content, (3) Verify the DDGS search implementation is working correctly with the intended queries.

The initial setup completed successfully, showing correct objective statement, workspace creation, and search initialization. However, the execution appears to have stopped or stalled after starting the first search query &#x27;James Bond Casino Royale 1955 film rights CBS television&#x27; and only shows &#x27;[WORKSPACE] Using task-specific workspace: workspace_webshaper_54&#x27; without any actual search results. **PLAN** alignment: 10% - setup completed but no James Bond film rights data was retrieved. The code improvements are good (better error handling, more focused queries, increased timeout), but the search execution didn&#x27;t complete. Recommended next steps: (1) Check if the search is still running or if it timed out, (2) Consider reducing the number of search queries or simplifying the search terms to ensure completion, (3) Add more verbose logging to track search progress, (4) If searches are completing but results aren&#x27;t showing, save any partial results to workspace files for analysis.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution failed - The code contains a critical variable definition error that prevents proper execution. The error &#x27;name &#x27;combined_text&#x27; is not defined&#x27; occurs at line 227, indicating the variable is referenced before being properly defined in the search result processing loop. The code appears to have executed a completely different search about Civil War pensions, Metcalf military records, and Auburn institutions instead of James Bond film rights research. The actual output shows searches for &#x27;1897 pension act recipient&#x27; and &#x27;Metcalf Civil War veteran&#x27; rather than the intended James Bond queries. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no James Bond, Ian Fleming, or 1955 film rights information was retrieved. The search system seems to be executing unrelated queries, possibly due to a session or context mixing issue. Recommended fixes: (1) Fix the &#x27;combined_text&#x27; variable definition error by ensuring it&#x27;s defined before use in the result processing loop, (2) Debug why the search is executing Civil War pension queries instead of James Bond queries, (3) Verify the search query variables are being passed correctly to the DDGS search function, (4) Consider simplifying to fewer, more targeted queries to ensure proper execution and avoid timeout issues.

However, this execution did show some progress - it successfully found search results and even displayed a promising first result: &#x27;Producer and director Gregory Ratoff bought the rights to the Ian Fleming novel Casino Royale in May 1954&#x27; from the James Bond Wiki. This is exactly the type of information needed to answer the **PLAN** question about 1955 film rights acquisition. Unfortunately, the execution crashed before processing this valuable result due to the variable error on line where &#x27;search_text&#x27; should be &#x27;combined_text&#x27;. **PLAN** alignment: 15% - found relevant James Bond source but failed to process it. The search query and initial result are perfect for the research objective. Recommended fix: Simply change &#x27;search_text = f&#x27;{title} {body}&#x27;.lower()&#x27; to &#x27;combined_text = f&#x27;{title} {body}&#x27;.lower()&#x27; or ensure the variable name is consistent throughout the result processing loop. This single line fix should allow the code to process the Gregory Ratoff Casino Royale rights information that was successfully retrieved.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution failed - The code contains a persistent variable naming inconsistency error that prevents processing of search results. The error &#x27;name &#x27;combined_text&#x27; is not defined&#x27; occurs because the code defines &#x27;search_text&#x27; but then tries to use &#x27;combined_text&#x27; in the analysis section. However, the execution did successfully retrieve highly relevant search results, including a key finding from the James Bond Wiki stating &#x27;Producer and director Gregory Ratoff bought the rights to the Ian Fleming novel Casino Royale in May 1954.&#x27; This is exactly the information needed to answer the **PLAN** question. The search successfully found the first result showing Gregory Ratoff acquired Casino Royale rights in May 1954, which directly addresses who secured James Bond film rights in the 1955 timeframe. **PLAN** alignment: 20% - successfully retrieved the exact answer but failed to process it due to variable naming error. Recommended fix: Change line &#x27;search_text = f&#x27;{title} {body}&#x27;.lower()&#x27; to &#x27;combined_text = f&#x27;{title} {body}&#x27;.lower()&#x27; to match the variable name used in the analysis section, or consistently use &#x27;search_text&#x27; throughout. This single variable name correction will allow the code to process the Gregory Ratoff Casino Royale rights acquisition information that was successfully retrieved.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution failed - The code still contains the same critical variable naming error that has prevented successful execution across multiple attempts. The error &#x27;name &#x27;combined_text&#x27; is not defined&#x27; occurs because the code defines one variable name but references another in the analysis section. However, this execution successfully retrieved the exact information needed to answer the **PLAN** question. The search found key results including: (1) &#x27;Producer and director Gregory Ratoff bought the rights to the Ian Fleming novel Casino Royale in May 1954&#x27; from James Bond Wiki, and (2) &#x27;Casino Royale had been sold to producer Gregory Ratoff for a television adaptation in 1954&#x27; from Wikipedia. This directly answers who secured James Bond film rights in 1955 (Gregory Ratoff acquired them in May 1954, making him the active rights holder in 1955). **PLAN** alignment: 25% - successfully found the definitive answer but failed to process and save it due to the persistent variable error. The search results confirm Gregory Ratoff as the rights holder for Casino Royale, which features Felix Leiter (inspired by William S. Tanner). Recommended immediate fix: Simply ensure consistent variable naming throughout - either use &#x27;combined_text&#x27; everywhere or &#x27;search_text&#x27; everywhere. This single line fix will allow processing of the Gregory Ratoff Casino Royale rights information that has been successfully retrieved multiple times.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements. The script successfully executed a targeted search and found highly relevant results, including key information from Wikipedia and James Bond Wiki confirming that &#x27;Producer and director Gregory Ratoff bought the rights to the Ian Fleming novel Casino Royale in May 1954.&#x27; The code processed 3 search results with perfect relevance scores (5/5) and extracted comprehensive details about Gregory Ratoff&#x27;s acquisition of Casino Royale rights. All **PLAN** requirements were satisfied: (1) Identified Gregory Ratoff as the person who secured James Bond film rights in 1955, (2) Confirmed the novel was Casino Royale featuring Felix Leiter character inspired by William S. Tanner, (3) Documented the timeline (acquired May 1954, active rights holder in 1955), and (4) Found evidence of early film rights acquisition and subsequent relinquishment. The code successfully saved results to multiple workspace files including comprehensive search data, final answer, and human-readable summary. The output provides definitive evidence from authoritative sources (Wikipedia, James Bond Wiki) with very high confidence level. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete. No further development is needed - the research question has been definitively answered with comprehensive supporting evidence.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed comprehensive research on Gregory Ratoff&#x27;s profession and career background. The search results clearly identify Gregory Ratoff as a multi-talented entertainment professional who worked as a film director, producer, and actor. Key findings include: (1) He was a Russian-born American (1893/1897-1960) who worked in all three major roles - director, producer, and actor, (2) Multiple sources confirm he purchased the Casino Royale film rights from Ian Fleming in the mid-1950s for $6,000, establishing his role as a producer during that period, (3) As an actor, he&#x27;s best known for playing producer Max Fabian in &#x27;All About Eve&#x27; (1950), and (4) He had an extensive filmography spanning multiple decades in Hollywood. The **PLAN** objective has been fully achieved - his primary occupation was clearly identified as a film industry professional working in multiple capacities, with strong evidence of his producer role during the 1950s Casino Royale acquisition. The search results are comprehensive and saved to three JSON files for reference. No further development is needed as all **PLAN** requirements have been met.
