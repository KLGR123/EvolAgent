The analysis successfully identified:\n\n✅ **Organization**: United Ancient Order of Druids (UAOD) - confirmed as the organization that developed Surrey Lodge, based on Finding #4 which shows &#x27;Surrey Lodge No 266 United Ancient Order of Druids UAOD&#x27;\n\n✅ **Founder**: Henry Hurle - identified as the founder of the Ancient Order of Druids, established in 1781 at the King&#x27;s Arms Tavern in London\n\n✅ **Birth Year**: 1739 - determined through targeted biographical research and historical context analysis\n\n✅ **Complete Historical Context**: The research established the full timeline from Henry Hurle&#x27;s founding of the Ancient Order of Druids in 1781, through the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge No 266 in South London, its transformation into a temperance hall with the UK&#x27;s first rotating stage (1935), WWII bombing damage, and the company&#x27;s subsequent relocation to Burnley.\n\nThe research data has been thoroughly analyzed, verified, and compiled into comprehensive final answers saved in multiple workspace files including &#x27;surrey_lodge_verified_final_answer.json&#x27;. All aspects of the PLAN have been successfully addressed with high confidence levels for organization identification, founder identification, and birth year determination based on solid historical evidence.\n\n**Final Answer**: The organization that developed Surrey Lodge was the United Ancient Order of Druids (UAOD), founded by Henry Hurle, who was born in 1739.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted in the HISTORY, the developer has definitively identified that Surrey Lodge in South London was developed by the United Ancient Order of Druids (UAOD), which was founded by Henry Hurle in 1781. The research confirmed all historical elements: Surrey Lodge&#x27;s Victorian-era development, transformation into a temperance hall, installation of the UK&#x27;s first rotating stage in 1935, World War II bomb damage, and the company&#x27;s relocation to Burnley. Through targeted biographical research, Henry Hurle&#x27;s birth year was determined to be 1739.

Also investigate the character inspired by William S. Tanner to help identify the specific novel. Look for early James Bond film history, pre-EON Productions rights deals, and any connections to characters based on real people like William S. Tanner.<br><br>Plan Description:<br>This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific 1955 film rights deal involving a James Bond novel, which predates the famous EON Productions series, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to find historical records of early James Bond film rights acquisitions and identify the person&#x27;s profession who made the 1955 deal, (4) This directly targets the unique combination of 1955 timing, Ian Fleming work, William S. Tanner character connection, and the rights relinquishment due to series acquisition failure<br><br>Retrieved Episodic Memory Examples:<br>### Development Step 1: Goldfinger (1964) Finale Concealment Objects and Colors Used by Bond and Pussy Galore<br><br>**Description**: Search for detailed information about the ending of the 1964 James Bond film &#x27;Goldfinger&#x27; starring Sean Connery.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution failed - The code successfully connected to SerpAPI and retrieved search results (10 JSON files were saved), but crashed during the analysis phase due to a NameError: &#x27;full_text&#x27; is not defined. This variable scoping error occurred in the result analysis loop where &#x27;full_text&#x27; was defined inside a for loop but referenced outside its scope. The code completed 0% of the **PLAN** objective because while raw search data was collected, no analysis was performed to extract the specific 1955 James Bond film rights information. The comprehensive analysis phase failed completely, leaving all research questions unanswered. Recommended fix: Move the &#x27;full_text = f&quot;{title} {snippet}&quot;&#x27; line to the correct scope within the result processing loop, and ensure all variables are properly defined before use. The search data is preserved in 10 JSON files, so the analysis can be re-run without repeating the API calls.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution failed - The code encountered the same NameError: &#x27;full_text&#x27; is not defined during the analysis phase, preventing proper extraction of the 1955 James Bond film rights information. While the code successfully found and processed 10 search result files (114 total results), the variable scoping error caused all analysis to fail. Interestingly, despite the error, the code still managed to identify some findings (3 novel identification results confirming Casino Royale) and generated output files, but achieved only 20% success rate with most research questions unanswered. **PLAN** alignment: 20% - only identified the novel (Casino Royale) but failed to extract information about the rights acquirer, their profession, relinquishment reasons, or William Tanner connections. Recommended fix: Correct the variable scoping by ensuring &#x27;full_text = f&quot;{title} {snippet}&quot;&#x27; is properly defined within the result processing loop before being used for analysis. The search data exists and contains valuable information (as evidenced by the sample snippet mentioning Gregory Ratoff), but the parsing error prevents extraction.

The error occurs during the analysis loop where &#x27;full_text&#x27; is referenced but not properly defined within the correct scope. While the code successfully processes 10 search result files (114 total results) and shows promising evidence in the sample data (mentioning Gregory Ratoff and $6,000 transaction), the variable scoping bug prevents any meaningful analysis. **PLAN** alignment: 20% - only partially identifies Casino Royale as the 1955 novel but fails to extract the complete information about Gregory Ratoff as the acquirer, his producer profession, or relinquishment reasons. The search data clearly contains the answers (visible in sample snippets), but the parsing error blocks extraction. Recommended fix: Move the line &#x27;full_text = f&quot;{title} {snippet}&quot;&#x27; to be defined immediately after extracting title and snippet variables, and ensure it&#x27;s within the same loop scope where it&#x27;s used for term matching and analysis.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and achieved 60% of the **PLAN** objectives. The fixed variable scoping allowed proper analysis of 10 search result files (114 total results), successfully identifying 3 out of 5 research questions: (1) Novel: Casino Royale confirmed with multiple Wikipedia sources, (2) Rights Acquirer: Gregory Ratoff confirmed with evidence, (3) Profession: Film/Television Producer confirmed. However, the analysis failed to find evidence for relinquishment reasons and William Tanner character connections. The code generated comprehensive output with detailed evidence including URLs and snippets, plus saved final analysis to JSON and summary report files. **PLAN** alignment: 60% complete - most key information identified with solid evidence sources. The research successfully extracted the core 1955 James Bond film rights information from the search data, though some secondary questions remain unanswered. Recommendation: The current results provide substantial answers to the main research questions and no further development is needed for the core **PLAN** objectives.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and achieved 100% of the **PLAN** objectives. The implementation successfully analyzed all 10 search result files (114 total results) and extracted comprehensive information about the 1955 James Bond film rights acquisition. All 5 research questions were answered with solid evidence: (1) Novel: Casino Royale confirmed with multiple sources, (2) Rights Acquirer: Gregory Ratoff identified with evidence, (3) Profession: Film/Television Producer confirmed, (4) Relinquishment: Due to Gregory Ratoff&#x27;s death and inability to secure entire series, (5) William Tanner: Character connections found. The code generated detailed evidence with 66 total pieces across categories, created comprehensive JSON analysis data, and produced human-readable summary reports. **PLAN** alignment: 100% - all core research objectives completed with comprehensive evidence from authoritative sources like Wikipedia. The research successfully identified the specific 1955 James Bond film rights details including the $6,000 transaction amount and March 1955 timeline. No further development is needed as the **PLAN** has been fully achieved.
