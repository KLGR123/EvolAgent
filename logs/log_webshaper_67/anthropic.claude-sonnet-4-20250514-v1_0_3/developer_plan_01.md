# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_67  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-12 07:39:31

## Plan Content
```
Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify a religious organization that placed a monument in 1960 at a historic site related to the restoration of religious authority, and then started a property acquisition and restoration project in 1962 in a specific town. Search for keywords including '1960 monument religious authority restoration historic site', 'religious organization 1962 property acquisition restoration project', 'American Association State Local History 2016 designation', and cross-reference these elements to identify the specific town, religious organization, and historic site involved.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the religious organization, the 1960 monument location, and the 1962 town project simultaneously, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find historical records or news coverage connecting these specific dates and activities, (4) This directly targets the core TASK of identifying the town where the 1962 property restoration project began, which is linked to both the 1960 monument and the 2016 AASLH designation

### Development Step 6: Surrey Lodge South London: Victorian Origins, Temperance Hall, 1935 Rotating Stage, WWII Damage, Burnley Move

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify Surrey Lodge in South London and trace its historical development during the Victorian era. Focus on finding information about: (1) the original organization that developed Surrey Lodge, (2) its transformation into a temperance hall, (3) the installation of the UK's first rotating stage in 1935, (4) World War II bomb damage, and (5) the company's relocation to Burnley. Use search terms like 'Surrey Lodge South London Victorian era temperance hall', 'first rotating stage UK 1935 temperance hall', 'Surrey Lodge bomb damage World War II Burnley', and 'Victorian temperance organization Surrey Lodge founder'.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum exhibition curation: Conduct automated web searches and timeline analysis to verify Surrey Lodge‚Äôs architectural changes, temperance hall conversion, and WWII damage for accurate exhibit signage and narrative content.
- Heritage consultancy for planning permissions: Compile historical evidence of Victorian-era developments, rotating stage installations, and bomb damage to support restoration and planning applications for listed building consent.
- Academic publication on the Victorian temperance movement: Systematically extract founding organization details, key dates, and transformation events at Surrey Lodge for inclusion in a peer-reviewed history journal article.
- Cultural preservation grant writing: Assemble a detailed chronology of Surrey Lodge‚Äôs conversion into a temperance hall, first rotating stage installation, and wartime repairs to strengthen grant proposals for heritage conservation funding.
- Legal property due diligence: Trace documented structural modifications, WWII bomb damage references, and subsequent company relocation records to resolve title disputes and inform conveyancing reports.
- Urban historical mapping project: Automate targeted searches and relevance scoring to integrate Surrey Lodge‚Äôs development timeline and relocation data into a digital heritage GIS for local authority archives.
- Industrial heritage documentary production: Gather precise dates and primary‚Äêsource snippets about the UK‚Äôs first rotating stage in 1935 and Surrey Lodge‚Äôs wartime story to script an educational documentary segment.
- Genealogical estate research: Use comprehensive search queries and timeline extraction to uncover ancestral connections to Surrey Lodge, detailing original ownership, temperance hall use, and post-Blitz relocation for family history publications.

### Development Step 3: Surrey Lodge: Origins, Victorian Temperance Hall, 1935 Rotating Stage, WWII Damage, Burnley Relocation

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify Surrey Lodge in South London and trace its historical development during the Victorian era. Focus on finding information about: (1) the original organization that developed Surrey Lodge, (2) its transformation into a temperance hall, (3) the installation of the UK's first rotating stage in 1935, (4) World War II bomb damage, and (5) the company's relocation to Burnley. Use search terms like 'Surrey Lodge South London Victorian era temperance hall', 'first rotating stage UK 1935 temperance hall', 'Surrey Lodge bomb damage World War II Burnley', and 'Victorian temperance organization Surrey Lodge founder'.

**Use Cases**:

### Development Step 8: Surrey Lodge South London: Victorian origins, temperance hall, 1935 rotating stage, WWII damage, Burnley move

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify Surrey Lodge in South London and trace its historical development during the Victorian era. Focus on finding information about: (1) the original organization that developed Surrey Lodge, (2) its transformation into a temperance hall, (3) the installation of the UK's first rotating stage in 1935, (4) World War II bomb damage, and (5) the company's relocation to Burnley. Use search terms like 'Surrey Lodge South London Victorian era temperance hall', 'first rotating stage UK 1935 temperance hall', 'Surrey Lodge bomb damage World War II Burnley', and 'Victorian temperance organization Surrey Lodge founder'.

**Use Cases**:
- Heritage conservation consultants mapping architectural evolutions of Victorian-era lodges for restoration planning
- Academic historians compiling primary source timelines of temperance movements in London‚Äôs 19th-century social reform venues
- Cultural tourism agencies creating enriched interactive guides highlighting milestones like the UK‚Äôs first rotating stage in historical halls
- Local council archives automating WWII damage assessments of municipal buildings for grant applications and rebuilding strategies
- Corporate heritage departments tracing the lineage and relocations of legacy companies for anniversary publications and branding campaigns
- Nonprofit social historians analyzing temperance hall transformations to underpin public lectures and educational program development
- Legal due diligence teams researching property provenance and historical modifications for redevelopment and planning permissions
- Documentary producers sourcing detailed period facts and evidence for accurate media portrayals of South London‚Äôs entertainment venues

### Development Step 1: Surrey Lodge: Victorian founding, temperance hall conversion, 1935 rotating stage, WWII bombing, Burnley move

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify Surrey Lodge in South London and trace its historical development during the Victorian era. Focus on finding information about: (1) the original organization that developed Surrey Lodge, (2) its transformation into a temperance hall, (3) the installation of the UK's first rotating stage in 1935, (4) World War II bomb damage, and (5) the company's relocation to Burnley. Use search terms like 'Surrey Lodge South London Victorian era temperance hall', 'first rotating stage UK 1935 temperance hall', 'Surrey Lodge bomb damage World War II Burnley', and 'Victorian temperance organization Surrey Lodge founder'.

**Use Cases**:
- Heritage conservation research and comprehensive historical data aggregation for Victorian-era building restoration proposals
- Corporate due diligence investigations and facility history tracing for M&A risk assessment in property acquisitions
- Legal evidence reconstruction and timeline mapping for intellectual property and trademark dispute support
- Investigative journalism fact-checking and multimedia content sourcing for feature articles on community landmarks
- Urban planning analysis and wartime destruction mapping for infrastructure redevelopment and heritage preservation
- Genealogical research automation and archival record correlation for constructing detailed family property histories
- Cultural heritage exhibition preparation and archival data compilation for museum showcases on social movements and theatre innovations
- Academic historical research and automated timeline extraction for scholarly publications on Victorian social organizations

    "description": "Implementation of comprehensive web search to identify a religious organization that placed a 1960 monument and started a 1962 restoration project. This code executes targeted searches using multiple search engines to find evidence of: (1) 1960 monument placement at historic site related to religious authority restoration, (2) religious organization involvement, (3) 1962 property acquisition and restoration project, (4) American Association of State and Local History 2016 designation, and (5) specific town and organization identification. The approach uses relevance scoring based on key terms like '1960', 'monument', 'religious organization', '1962', 'property acquisition', 'AASLH', and '2016 designation'. Results are systematically analyzed for historical indicators, compiled into comprehensive evidence analysis, and saved to workspace files for further investigation. The code includes proper error handling, rate limiting, and generates both detailed JSON data and summary reports to support identification of the specific religious organization, town, and historic site involved in this timeline.",

The search execution partially succeeded, completing some web searches and fetching Wikipedia pages, but crashed during the analysis phase before completing the **PLAN** requirements. The code successfully executed 2 out of 8 planned searches and fetched 4 Wikipedia pages with some relevant content, but failed to identify the specific religious organization, monument details, or 1962 restoration project as required by the **PLAN**. **PLAN** alignment: 15% - basic search infrastructure worked but core objective not achieved due to variable scoping error. Recommended fix: Debug the variable scoping issue around line 217 where 'section_text' is referenced but not properly defined in the current scope, and ensure all variables are properly declared before use in loops and generator expressions.",

    "description": "Fixed implementation of comprehensive web search to identify a religious organization that placed a 1960 monument and started a 1962 restoration project. This corrected version addresses the variable scoping error that caused the previous crash by using simplified, direct variable assignments within proper scope boundaries. The code executes targeted searches using multiple search engines to find evidence of: (1) 1960 monument placement at historic site, (2) religious organization involvement, (3) 1962 property acquisition and restoration project, (4) American Association of State and Local History 2016 designation, and (5) specific town and organization identification. The approach uses direct keyword analysis with relevance scoring based on terms like '1960', 'monument', 'religious organization', '1962', 'property acquisition', 'AASLH', and '2016 designation'. Results are systematically analyzed for historical indicators, compiled into evidence frequency analysis, and saved to workspace files. The code includes proper error handling, rate limiting, organization/location extraction, and generates both detailed JSON data and summary reports to support identification of the specific religious organization, town, and historic site involved in this timeline.",

The search execution partially succeeded, completing 3 out of 6 planned searches and finding some relevant results (AASLH connections, 2016 designations, religious organizations), but crashed repeatedly due to variable scoping issues. The code successfully identified some promising evidence including AASLH 2016 awards and religious organization references, but failed to complete the analysis phase needed to identify the specific religious organization, town, and historic site as required by the **PLAN**. **PLAN** alignment: 25% - search infrastructure worked and found some relevant indicators, but core objective not achieved due to variable scoping errors. Recommended fix: Debug the variable scoping issue where 'combined_text' is referenced outside its defined scope - ensure the variable is properly declared and accessible in all code blocks where it's used, particularly in the evidence analysis sections.",

    "description": 'Fixed implementation of comprehensive web search to identify a religious organization that placed a 1960 monument and started a 1962 restoration project. This corrected version addresses the critical variable scoping errors that caused previous crashes by ensuring all variables (combined_text, title, body, url) are properly defined within the same scope where they are used. The code executes targeted searches using multiple search engines to find evidence of: (1) 1960 monument placement at historic site, (2) religious organization involvement, (3) 1962 property acquisition and restoration project, (4) American Association of State and Local History 2016 designation, and (5) specific town and organization identification. The approach uses direct keyword analysis with relevance scoring, proper error handling for individual result processing, organization/location context extraction, and systematic evidence frequency analysis. Results are compiled into comprehensive JSON data and summary reports saved to workspace files, including specific organizations and locations found, timeline references, and focus area confirmation status to support identification of the specific religious organization, town, and historic site involved in this timeline.',

    "feedback": "Execution failed - Code encountered a NameError 'name 'combined_text' is not defined' that occurs repeatedly during search result processing. The search execution partially succeeded, completing 6 out of 6 planned searches and finding some relevant results (AASLH connections, 2016 designations, religious organizations), but crashed during result analysis due to variable scoping issues. The code successfully identified some promising evidence including AASLH 2016 awards and religious organization references (like 'Peoples Temple'), but failed to complete the comprehensive analysis needed to identify the specific religious organization, town, and historic site as required by the **PLAN**. **PLAN** alignment: 30% - search infrastructure worked and found relevant indicators, but core objective not achieved due to persistent variable scoping errors. The issue appears to be that 'combined_text' is defined within the result processing loop but then referenced outside its scope during timeline extraction and organization/location analysis. Recommended fix: Ensure 'combined_text' variable is properly accessible throughout the entire result processing block, or restructure the code to avoid referencing variables outside their defined scope.",

    "description": 'Implementation of targeted search to identify a religious organization that placed a 1960 monument and started a 1962 restoration project. This approach first inspects existing research data to understand previous findings, then conducts focused searches based on AASLH 2016 connections discovered earlier. The code uses simplified variable scoping to avoid previous errors, executing targeted queries that combine key elements: AASLH 2016 awards, religious organizations, 1960 monuments, and 1962 restoration projects. It systematically analyzes results for timeline matches (1960, 1962, 2016), extracts organization and location names, calculates relevance scores, and identifies complete matches where all criteria align. The approach includes proper error handling, organization/location context extraction, timeline element tracking, and generates comprehensive reports with specific findings. Results are saved to workspace files including detailed JSON data and summary reports to support identification of the specific religious organization, town, and historic site involved in this historical timeline.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed all 6 targeted searches as planned. The search execution succeeded in finding and processing relevant results, identifying strong AASLH 2016 connections with 5 high-scoring findings (all scoring 18 points). However, the **PLAN** objective was only partially achieved with a 16.7% success rate (1/6 focus areas confirmed). The code successfully confirmed AASLH 2016 designation connections but failed to identify the specific 1960 monument, 1962 restoration project, religious organization, historic site, or authority restoration theme required by the **PLAN**. The output shows 3 high-priority findings including 'Nauvoo Restoration, Inc. (1962-2012)', 'Priesthood Restoration Site - Wikipedia', and 'Priesthood Restoration Site - The Church of Jesus Christ', which appear highly relevant to the search criteria. **PLAN** alignment: 40% - basic search infrastructure successful and some relevant findings collected, but needs deeper investigation of the high-scoring results to extract specific organization names, towns, and monument details. Recommendation: The lengthy output (200+ lines) contains valuable analysis results and should be saved to 'workspace/religious_org_detailed_analysis.txt' for future reference and further investigation of the promising Nauvoo and Priesthood Restoration Site findings.",

    "description": 'Implementation of deep analysis and focused search to identify the specific religious organization that placed a 1960 monument and started a 1962 restoration project. This code first inspects existing research data to understand high-priority findings (Nauvoo Restoration Inc. 1962, Priesthood Restoration Site 1960 monument), then conducts highly targeted searches combining these leads with AASLH 2016 connections. The approach uses detailed analysis to extract organization clues (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), location clues (Nauvoo, Illinois; Pennsylvania), timeline confirmations (1960 monument, 1962 restoration, 2016 AASLH), and historic site identification (Priesthood Restoration Site, Nauvoo Historic Site). Results are systematically analyzed using frequency counting to identify the most commonly mentioned organization and location, with comprehensive scoring for complete matches. The code generates detailed identification reports and saves comprehensive JSON data to workspace files, providing specific answers to the PLAN requirements: religious organization name, town/location, historic site, and timeline confirmation.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the comprehensive analysis as planned. The search execution succeeded in identifying key elements of the **PLAN** with significant progress made. The code successfully identified: (1) Organization: 'The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints', (2) Primary Location: 'Nauvoo', (3) Historic Site: 'Priesthood Restoration Site', and (4) Timeline confirmations for 1960 (3 mentions) and 2016 (2 mentions). However, the 1962 restoration project element received 0 confirmations, indicating this specific timeline component needs further investigation. The analysis found 15 detailed findings with 4 complete matches scoring 40+ points, demonstrating strong evidence for the religious organization identification. **PLAN** alignment: 85% - successfully identified the specific religious organization (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), town (Nauvoo), and historic site (Priesthood Restoration Site), with solid timeline evidence for 1960 monument placement and 2016 AASLH connections. The comprehensive output contains valuable identification data and has been properly saved to workspace files. The research appears to have successfully identified the core elements requested in the **PLAN**, though the 1962 restoration project connection could benefit from additional targeted investigation.",
