    "description": "Starting the search for Girls Who Code historical statistics about women in computer science. This initial phase accesses the organization's main website and key sections (about, research, advocacy, impact, resources) to identify potential sources of the 37% to 24% decline statistic. The code systematically downloads and analyzes each page, looking for statistical indicators, research links, and relevant content. It creates a comprehensive analysis of each source with relevance scoring based on key terms like percentages, research, reports, and historical data. The results are saved for further analysis, and research links are collected for follow-up investigation. This establishes the foundation for finding the specific historical data about women's declining representation in computer science that Girls Who Code likely references in their advocacy work.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful with excellent results - Code ran without errors and made significant progress toward the **PLAN** objectives. The script successfully accessed Girls Who Code's official website and found highly relevant content. Most importantly, the about-us page (girlswhocode_com_about-u.html) achieved a very high relevance score of 96 and contains the exact target statistics: both 37% and 24% percentages were detected, along with decline indicators, historical context, and computer science references. The code also discovered valuable research links to annual reports from 2022-2024. However, the output was truncated mid-execution, suggesting the script may have been interrupted before completing all phases. **PLAN** alignment: 80% - target statistics located but analysis incomplete. Recommendation: The high-priority source (about-us page) should be analyzed in detail to extract the specific 37% to 24% decline data and timeframe. The annual report links (2024report, 2023report, 2022report) should also be investigated as they likely contain the detailed historical statistics needed.",

The code systematically searches for both percentage values in context, looking for decline indicators, timeframe information, and computer science connections. It uses multiple regex patterns to capture the statistics in various formats and extracts relevant sections that might contain the complete narrative. Additionally, it follows up on the discovered annual report links (2024, 2023, 2022) which are likely to contain detailed historical data and potentially downloadable PDFs with comprehensive statistics. The analysis creates detailed JSON files documenting all findings and prepares for final extraction of the target statistics with proper context and timeframe information.',

The analysis successfully extracted the target statistics from Girls Who Code's about-us page, finding the exact data: 'In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. Today, it's only 24%.' This provides both percentages (37% to 24%) and the timeframe (1995 to present day). The code also discovered additional timeline data showing the decline progression: 1995 (37%), 2017 (24%), 2022 (22%). The script accessed 3 annual reports and saved comprehensive analysis results to multiple JSON files for future reference. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all required statistics and timeframe information has been successfully located and documented. The historical data shows women's representation in computer science declined from 37% in 1995 to 24% today, representing a 13 percentage point decrease over approximately 29 years.
