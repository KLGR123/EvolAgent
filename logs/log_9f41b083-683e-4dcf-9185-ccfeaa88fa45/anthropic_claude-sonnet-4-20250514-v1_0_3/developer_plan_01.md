# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for and access the 2023 IPCC report, specifically identifying the 85-page version mentioned in the TASK. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Search IPCC official website (ipcc.ch) for 2023 publications, (2) Use Google search with terms '2023 IPCC report 85 pages PDF', (3) Check for specific report titles like 'Climate Change 2023' or 'AR6 Synthesis Report', (4) Verify document authenticity by checking official IPCC branding and publication details. Once located, download the PDF to workspace/ and confirm it matches the 85-page specification before proceeding with nuclear energy content analysis.

## Description
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to locate and access the correct 2023 IPCC report with exactly 85 pages as specified in the TASK, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to identify and download the official IPCC document for nuclear energy analysis, (4) This establishes the foundation for systematically searching through the document to count pages mentioning nuclear energy.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 3: Confirm 2011 Extractive Metallurgy of Ni, Co, PGM Includes Lithium Calcination and Two-Stage Bioleaching

**Description**: Verify the identified 2011 Elsevier publication 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by conducting a targeted search to confirm it specifically covers both the calcination process with lithium salts for recovering metals from spent automotive catalysts AND the two-stage bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for low-grade cobalt ores. Search for the book's table of contents, chapter summaries, or detailed reviews that explicitly mention these two specific processes. Cross-reference with academic databases, publisher catalogs, and technical literature citations to ensure this publication contains both required methodologies described in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Patent due diligence for materials science: verifying that a 2022 WO patent application covers both reinforced polymer composites and flame-retardant additive processing steps by targeted SerpAPI queries to patent office and scholarly sources
- Pharmaceutical guideline confirmation: ensuring the 2020 WHO monograph explicitly includes renal dosage adjustment protocols and adverse reaction monitoring procedures by searching chapter summaries and section titles
- Automotive supplier audit: confirming an ISO/TS 16949 supplier manual online covers both heat-treatment procedures for chassis parts and corrosion-resistance testing protocols using focused Google searches
- Open-source software compliance check: verifying that a cryptography library’s documentation details both RSA key generation methods and AES-GCM encryption usage via structured search queries on GitHub Pages and developer blogs
- Market intelligence white-paper analysis: ensuring a competitor’s 2021 market study contains consumer behavior segmentation for North America and side-by-side feature comparisons with key rivals by scanning executive summaries and table of contents
- Academic textbook syllabus alignment: confirming a 2023 engineering thermodynamics textbook includes both entropy analysis chapters and exergy efficiency case studies as mandated by a university course outline
- GDPR compliance verification: checking that the EU’s official GDPR guidelines PDF addresses both data subject access rights and data breach notification requirements by targeted searches of section headings and legal commentary
- Environmental impact report validation: verifying that a 2019 EPA assessment document covers both greenhouse gas emission quantification methods and carbon capture technology evaluations through focused online catalog and summary searches

### Development Step 7: Access 2020 Nature.com Chinstrap Penguin Global Population Study; Extract Figures and Methodology

**Description**: Search for and access the Nature.com article titled 'global population assessment of the Chinstrap penguin' from 2020. Extract the specific population figure from this study, noting whether it's provided as breeding pairs or individual penguins. Document the exact methodology and population count to enable accurate comparison with the Wikipedia 2018 data.

**Use Cases**:
- Wildlife conservation policy development and regulatory compliance tracking for environmental agencies extracting Chinstrap penguin counts and survey methods to inform protected area management
- Automated meta-analysis pipeline for ecological research labs harvesting 2020 population figures and methodologies for comparative species trend studies
- Environmental NGO report generation and stakeholder presentations incorporating precise breeding-pair data from Nature studies into annual conservation impact reports
- Marine biology curriculum content creation using extracted global population figures and field census techniques as real-world case studies for university courses
- Integration of structured penguin population data into open biodiversity platforms and JSON databases to support public research and citizen science initiatives
- Climate change impact modeling workflow for research institutes feeding standardized population metrics into ecosystem simulation models to forecast Antarctic biodiversity shifts
- Journalistic fact-checking and science news enrichment verifying reported Chinstrap penguin numbers and methodology details when covering Nature.com publications
- Automated updates to Wikipedia species entries comparing 2020 Nature study data with 2018 figures and generating structured update recommendations for editors

### Development Step 28: Find and download ‘Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?’ PDF

**Description**: Conduct a web search for the University of Leicester paper titled "Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?" and download the full PDF of that paper into workspace/dragon_diet_fish_bag.pdf.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal research team automating the download of PDF court opinions from online legal database search result pages for case law analysis
- Academic consortium rapidly collecting PDF neuroscience preprints from Google Scholar HTML search outputs for a large‐scale meta-analysis
- Regulatory compliance department scraping PDF versions of newly published environmental regulations from government portal search listings for audit reporting
- Corporate knowledge management system harvesting PDF employee guidelines and policy documents from intranet search results to centralize organizational resources
- Patent research analysts extracting PDF patent specification files from patent office web search result pages for detailed freedom-to-operate studies
- Financial analysts auto-downloading PDF investor presentations and annual reports from company IR search pages to feed quantitative modeling pipelines
- Marketing intelligence team aggregating PDF press releases and media kits from competitor websites by parsing search result HTML for trend monitoring
- Nonprofit environmental group collecting PDF climate policy reports from UN and WHO search-result listings for impact assessment and advocacy research

### Development Step 8: Extract 2020 Chinstrap Penguin Population Count and Methodology from Nature.com Study for Comparison

**Description**: Search for and access the Nature.com article titled 'global population assessment of the Chinstrap penguin' from 2020. Extract the specific population figure from this study, noting whether it's provided as breeding pairs or individual penguins. Document the exact methodology and population count to enable accurate comparison with the Wikipedia 2018 data.

**Use Cases**:
- Conservation NGO population tracking dashboards and policy recommendation reports for Antarctic wildlife management
- Government environmental agency species status assessments and legislative drafting for marine protection
- Academic meta-analysis combining multi-decade seabird population studies for climate change impact research
- Automated update of biodiversity informatics platforms (e.g., GBIF) with standardized species counts and confidence intervals
- Ecotourism operator planning and risk assessment for Antarctic expeditions based on up-to-date penguin colony sizes
- Science education module development and interactive visualizations for university ecology courses
- Journalistic data-driven articles on wildlife biodiversity trends for environmental news outlets
- Environmental consultancy feasibility studies and impact assessments for proposed Antarctic infrastructure projects
