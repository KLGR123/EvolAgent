## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Determine the number of pages in the 2023 IPCC report (85 pages version) that mention nuclear energy. First, I analyzed whether there is a standalone 85-page IPCC report from 2023. Members 1 and 3 conducted comprehensive searches of official IPCC publications and both concluded no exact 85-page version exists. Member 2 claimed to download an 85-page report but didn't verify the page count directly. Member 3 identified the IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report LongerReport.pdf (126 pages) as being frequently referenced as having '85 pages' of content, which appears to be the document referred to in the task. For nuclear energy mentions, Member 1 found only 2 mentions of 'atomic energy' in contributor sections. Member 2 identified just 1 mention on page 69, while Member 3 found 5 mentions across 4 different pages (85, 90, 103, and 105). Member 3's analysis was most comprehensive, using systematic search for 38 nuclear-related terms with precise regex patterns. Their approach provided specific page numbers and context for each mention. Given that no actual 85-page version exists and the LongerReport.pdf is the closest match, Member 3's finding of 4 pages with nuclear energy mentions is the most reliable answer based on thorough methodology and specific evidence provided.
