# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for and identify the specific 2023 IPCC report that is 85 pages long. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) published multiple reports in 2023, so we need to locate the exact 85-page version mentioned in the TASK. Search for official IPCC publications from 2023, focusing on reports that are specifically 85 pages in length. Once identified, download the PDF document to the workspace for subsequent analysis of nuclear energy mentions.

## Description
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify which specific 2023 IPCC report is exactly 85 pages long since IPCC publishes multiple reports and summaries of varying lengths, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate and download the correct 85-page IPCC report from 2023, (4) This establishes the foundation for systematically counting all mentions of nuclear energy within the document.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 3: Confirm 2011 Extractive Metallurgy of Ni, Co, PGM Includes Lithium Calcination and Two-Stage Bioleaching

**Description**: Verify the identified 2011 Elsevier publication 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by conducting a targeted search to confirm it specifically covers both the calcination process with lithium salts for recovering metals from spent automotive catalysts AND the two-stage bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for low-grade cobalt ores. Search for the book's table of contents, chapter summaries, or detailed reviews that explicitly mention these two specific processes. Cross-reference with academic databases, publisher catalogs, and technical literature citations to ensure this publication contains both required methodologies described in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Patent due diligence for materials science: verifying that a 2022 WO patent application covers both reinforced polymer composites and flame-retardant additive processing steps by targeted SerpAPI queries to patent office and scholarly sources
- Pharmaceutical guideline confirmation: ensuring the 2020 WHO monograph explicitly includes renal dosage adjustment protocols and adverse reaction monitoring procedures by searching chapter summaries and section titles
- Automotive supplier audit: confirming an ISO/TS 16949 supplier manual online covers both heat-treatment procedures for chassis parts and corrosion-resistance testing protocols using focused Google searches
- Open-source software compliance check: verifying that a cryptography library’s documentation details both RSA key generation methods and AES-GCM encryption usage via structured search queries on GitHub Pages and developer blogs
- Market intelligence white-paper analysis: ensuring a competitor’s 2021 market study contains consumer behavior segmentation for North America and side-by-side feature comparisons with key rivals by scanning executive summaries and table of contents
- Academic textbook syllabus alignment: confirming a 2023 engineering thermodynamics textbook includes both entropy analysis chapters and exergy efficiency case studies as mandated by a university course outline
- GDPR compliance verification: checking that the EU’s official GDPR guidelines PDF addresses both data subject access rights and data breach notification requirements by targeted searches of section headings and legal commentary
- Environmental impact report validation: verifying that a 2019 EPA assessment document covers both greenhouse gas emission quantification methods and carbon capture technology evaluations through focused online catalog and summary searches

### Development Step 5: Total Peer-Reviewed Research Articles Published by Nature Journal in 2020

**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Use Cases**:
- University research office benchmarking annual publication output by counting peer-reviewed Nature research articles from 2020 to assess departmental performance
- Pharmaceutical R&D intelligence team extracting the total number of Nature 2020 immunology papers to prioritize drug discovery projects
- Funding agency audit unit verifying grantees met their 2020 deliverable of publishing in Nature by tallying approved research articles
- Biotech market analysis group monitoring Nature’s 2020 research volume in genomics to inform competitive positioning and investor pitches
- Academic library automation workflow updating catalog records by identifying and importing all 2020 Nature journal research publications
- Science newsroom editorial planning compiling “Top Breakthroughs of 2020” from Nature by filtering and ranking the year’s key research papers
- Intellectual property analysts mapping novel technologies by surveying all 2020 Nature research articles for patent landscaping
- Environmental NGO policy team quantifying 2020 Nature biodiversity studies to support evidence-based conservation advocacy

### Development Step 7: Access 2020 Nature.com Chinstrap Penguin Global Population Study; Extract Figures and Methodology

**Description**: Search for and access the Nature.com article titled 'global population assessment of the Chinstrap penguin' from 2020. Extract the specific population figure from this study, noting whether it's provided as breeding pairs or individual penguins. Document the exact methodology and population count to enable accurate comparison with the Wikipedia 2018 data.

**Use Cases**:
- Wildlife conservation policy development and regulatory compliance tracking for environmental agencies extracting Chinstrap penguin counts and survey methods to inform protected area management
- Automated meta-analysis pipeline for ecological research labs harvesting 2020 population figures and methodologies for comparative species trend studies
- Environmental NGO report generation and stakeholder presentations incorporating precise breeding-pair data from Nature studies into annual conservation impact reports
- Marine biology curriculum content creation using extracted global population figures and field census techniques as real-world case studies for university courses
- Integration of structured penguin population data into open biodiversity platforms and JSON databases to support public research and citizen science initiatives
- Climate change impact modeling workflow for research institutes feeding standardized population metrics into ecosystem simulation models to forecast Antarctic biodiversity shifts
- Journalistic fact-checking and science news enrichment verifying reported Chinstrap penguin numbers and methodology details when covering Nature.com publications
- Automated updates to Wikipedia species entries comparing 2020 Nature study data with 2018 figures and generating structured update recommendations for editors
