# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 9f41b083-683e-4dcf-9185-ccfeaa88fa45  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-06 16:31:57

## Plan Content
```
Search for and locate the 2023 IPCC report that is specifically 85 pages in length. Identify the exact title, working group, and official source of this report. Download the PDF document to the workspace directory for subsequent analysis of nuclear energy mentions.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify which specific 2023 IPCC report has exactly 85 pages, as IPCC publishes multiple reports and summaries of varying lengths, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate and obtain the correct 85-page IPCC document from 2023, (4) This establishes the foundation for systematically counting nuclear energy mentions throughout the document

### Development Step 3: Confirm 2011 Extractive Metallurgy of Ni, Co, PGM Includes Lithium Calcination and Two-Stage Bioleaching

**Description**: Verify the identified 2011 Elsevier publication 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by conducting a targeted search to confirm it specifically covers both the calcination process with lithium salts for recovering metals from spent automotive catalysts AND the two-stage bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for low-grade cobalt ores. Search for the book's table of contents, chapter summaries, or detailed reviews that explicitly mention these two specific processes. Cross-reference with academic databases, publisher catalogs, and technical literature citations to ensure this publication contains both required methodologies described in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Patent due diligence for materials science: verifying that a 2022 WO patent application covers both reinforced polymer composites and flame-retardant additive processing steps by targeted SerpAPI queries to patent office and scholarly sources
- Pharmaceutical guideline confirmation: ensuring the 2020 WHO monograph explicitly includes renal dosage adjustment protocols and adverse reaction monitoring procedures by searching chapter summaries and section titles
- Automotive supplier audit: confirming an ISO/TS 16949 supplier manual online covers both heat-treatment procedures for chassis parts and corrosion-resistance testing protocols using focused Google searches
- Open-source software compliance check: verifying that a cryptography library‚Äôs documentation details both RSA key generation methods and AES-GCM encryption usage via structured search queries on GitHub Pages and developer blogs
- Market intelligence white-paper analysis: ensuring a competitor‚Äôs 2021 market study contains consumer behavior segmentation for North America and side-by-side feature comparisons with key rivals by scanning executive summaries and table of contents
- Academic textbook syllabus alignment: confirming a 2023 engineering thermodynamics textbook includes both entropy analysis chapters and exergy efficiency case studies as mandated by a university course outline
- GDPR compliance verification: checking that the EU‚Äôs official GDPR guidelines PDF addresses both data subject access rights and data breach notification requirements by targeted searches of section headings and legal commentary
- Environmental impact report validation: verifying that a 2019 EPA assessment document covers both greenhouse gas emission quantification methods and carbon capture technology evaluations through focused online catalog and summary searches

### Development Step 43: Search and download ‚ÄúCan Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon‚Äôs Diet?‚Äù PDF

**Description**: Conduct a web search for the University of Leicester paper titled "Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon‚Äôs Diet?" and download the full PDF of that paper into workspace/dragon_diet_fish_bag.pdf.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated retrieval of institutional research papers by university librarians for populating digital archives
- Bulk download of technical datasheets from electronics manufacturers for embedded system design validation
- Automated collection of ISO standards and regulatory compliance PDFs for corporate quality management systems
- Patent attorneys fetching patent specification documents into legal analysis platforms for prior art review
- Pharmaceutical researchers gathering drug safety and clinical trial PDF reports for meta-analysis studies
- Journalists sourcing public records and PDF transcripts from government sites for investigative reporting
- Financial analysts downloading investment research PDFs from rating agencies for portfolio performance modeling
- Environmental scientists collecting environmental impact assessment PDFs from agency websites for ecosystem risk studies

I'm using multiple targeted search queries that combine IPCC-specific terms, the 2023 publication year, and the 85-page requirement. The search strategy includes: (1) Official IPCC site restrictions to find authoritative sources, (2) Working group and synthesis report variations to cover different IPCC publication types, (3) Nuclear energy context since that's mentioned in the plan, and (4) PDF filetype restrictions to find downloadable documents. The code analyzes results for key indicators like official IPCC domain links, direct PDF links, page count mentions, and report type classifications. All results are saved to a JSON file in the workspace for subsequent analysis, and the output provides a clear summary of findings to guide the next steps in identifying and downloading the specific 85-page report.",

The code: (1) Inspects the search results file structure first to understand the data format, (2) Identifies the specific report details including title, working group (Synthesis Report combining WG I, II, III), and official IPCC source, (3) Downloads the PDF from the official IPCC URL with proper headers and error handling, (4) Validates the downloaded file by checking PDF format and file size, (5) Saves comprehensive metadata about the report and download process, and (6) Provides a complete summary confirming all PLAN requirements are met. The report is now ready in the workspace directory for subsequent analysis of nuclear energy mentions as specified in the PLAN.",
