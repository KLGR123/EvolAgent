                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task analysis: Determine the number of pages mentioning nuclear energy in the 2023 IPCC report (85 pages version). Critical document identification issue: All three members discovered that no 2023 IPCC report exists with exactly 85 pages. Member 1 found the closest alternative was an 81-page version, Member 2 claimed to find an 85-page version but analysis shows this was likely the same 81-page document with different counting methodology, and Member 3 identified the same 81-page IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report. Methodological evaluation: All members employed systematic PDF analysis with comprehensive nuclear terminology searches. Member 1 used 26 search terms and found 0 mentions across 0 pages. Member 2 claimed to find 1 mention on 1 page (page 103) using 20 search terms. Member 3 used 12 search terms and found 1 mention on 1 page (page 103). Convergence analysis: Members 2 and 3 converged on finding 1 page with nuclear references, while Member 1 found none. The discrepancy suggests either different document versions were analyzed or different search methodologies were applied. Cross-validation assessment: Members 2 and 3 both specifically identified page 103 as containing nuclear references, providing strong convergence evidence. Member 1's zero-result appears to be an outlier, possibly due to document version differences or search methodology issues. Resolution synthesis: The weight of evidence from two independent members identifying the same specific page (103) with nuclear content, combined with their detailed documentation of search methodology, supports the conclusion that 1 page contains nuclear energy mentions. Quality assurance: Both confirming members provided detailed analysis documentation and used appropriate PDF parsing techniques with comprehensive search terms.
