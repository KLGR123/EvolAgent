## Final Answer
```
Shelley's Place
```

## Reasoning
```
Task decomposition: Identify the best available full house accommodation with swimming facilities for a family from Seahorse Island listings. All three members successfully parsed the PDF and conducted systematic analysis with consistent methodology. Member evaluation: All members correctly identified 4 rental houses with swimming amenities (Ocean and Main, Shelley's Place, Creakwood Creek, Headrush Beach) and determined availability status accurately. Member 1 provided most comprehensive analysis with detailed JSON output and rating assessment (Ocean and Main 5/5 stars occupied, Shelley's Place 4/5 stars available, Creakwood Creek 3/5 stars occupied). Member 2 focused efficiently on the core requirement with clear filtering methodology. Member 3 conducted thorough comparative analysis including family-specific considerations and practical recommendations. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: all members identified Shelley's Place as the only currently available full house with swimming facilities. No contradictions found in core findings. Integration assessment: The unanimous conclusion is methodologically sound - availability is the primary constraint, and among houses with swimming amenities, only Shelley's Place meets the 'available' criterion. All members noted the 4/5 star rating and pool access as positive factors, with minor concerns about creaky floors mentioned in reviews. Final validation: Shelley's Place definitively represents the better available option as it's the sole choice that satisfies both requirements (full house + swimming facilities + availability). Confidence level: very high based on unanimous expert agreement and systematic analysis.
