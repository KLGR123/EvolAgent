**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 20:38:08

## Plan Content
```
Search for Nedoshivina's 2010 scientific paper that includes descriptions of Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov. Focus on finding the complete publication with methods/materials sections or specimen repository information. Use these search approaches: (1) Academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or ResearchGate using keywords 'Nedoshivina 2010 Vietnamese specimens Kuznetzov', (2) Taxonomic databases that might reference specimen deposits, (3) Journal archives that published the paper in 2010. Look specifically for sections mentioning specimen deposition, museum collections, or institutional repositories where the Vietnamese materials were stored.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to locate the specific 2010 paper by Nedoshivina that mentions Kuznetzov's Vietnamese specimens, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the publication and identify specimen repository information, (4) This directly targets finding the deposition location mentioned in the paper

    "description": "Beginning comprehensive search for Nedoshivina's 2010 scientific paper that includes Vietnamese specimens described by Kuznetzov. This initial search phase uses multiple search strategies: (1) Direct search using author name, year, and specimen keywords, (2) Fallback broader search if specific terms yield no results, (3) Additional targeted searches using variations like 'taxonomy', 'museum collection', and PDF file filters. The code systematically identifies academic sources by looking for indicators like DOI links, journal sites, PDF files, and specimen-related terminology. Results are saved to workspace files for further analysis. This approach maximizes the chance of finding the specific 2010 publication containing information about Vietnamese specimen deposits and repository details.",

The approach: (1) First inspects the search results JSON file structure to understand available data, (2) Identifies the most relevant results focusing on direct paper access (PDF and archive links), (3) Attempts to download the actual paper PDF from the Zobodat link for detailed analysis, (4) Extracts and organizes key findings about the specimen repository (ZISP - Zoological Institute St. Petersburg), (5) Saves comprehensive findings for further analysis. This directly addresses the PLAN's requirement to find the complete publication with specimen repository information, as the search successfully identified that Vietnamese specimens described by Kuznetzov were deposited in the main collection of ZISP (Zoological Institute, St. Petersburg). The code prioritizes accessing the actual paper content to examine methods/materials sections as requested.",
