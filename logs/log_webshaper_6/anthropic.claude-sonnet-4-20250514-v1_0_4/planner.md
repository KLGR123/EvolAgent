### Who testified to convict two gang leaders tied to 1924â€“1934 robberies and a 1933 jailbreak?

**TASK**: What is the name of the person who provided testimony that helped convict two gang leadersâ€”the leader of the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang, which committed bank robberies including their first major heist in Indiana in 1924 and a 1934 bank robbery (the last robbery participated in by John Dillinger) involving a black Hudson getaway car and prompting the city's police department to acquire a custom Studebaker car; and another leader who committed a crime during the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger, resulting in the death of a sheriff and leading to the conviction of Harry Pierpont?
