# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 65da0822-a48a-4a68-bbad-8ed1b835a834  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-30 17:05:21

## Plan Content
```
Analyze the compiled dataset of DHS Secretaries and their bachelor's degree universities to determine geographic locations. Extract the city locations for Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts), Santa Clara University (Santa Clara, California), Morehouse College (Atlanta, Georgia), and Georgetown University (Washington, D.C.). Calculate or research the longitudinal coordinates to identify which university city is westernmost and which is easternmost, then format the final answer as requested with westernmost city first in a comma-separated list.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal next step because: (1) We have the complete verified dataset of 5 confirmed DHS Secretaries and their bachelor's degree institutions from the previous research, (2) The universities identified are Harvard (Cambridge, MA), Santa Clara (Santa Clara, CA), Morehouse (Atlanta, GA), and Georgetown (Washington, DC), (3) Expected outcome is to determine longitudinal positions and identify the westernmost and easternmost cities, (4) This directly completes the TASK by providing the final comma-separated city list as requested.

The code has a syntax error where the 'except Exception as e:' statement is not properly aligned with its corresponding 'try' block. The indentation appears to be inconsistent, causing Python to expect an 'except' or 'finally' block but finding malformed syntax instead. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - code couldn't execute due to syntax error, preventing any workspace file inspection or data gathering. Recommended fix: Check the indentation around line 40 in the JSON file reading section - the 'except Exception as e:' line needs to be properly aligned with its 'try' statement.

    "description": "This code analyzes the compiled DHS Secretaries dataset to extract university locations and calculate longitudinal coordinates. I'm loading the corrected dataset which contains clean data for all 5 DHS Secretaries and their bachelor's universities. The code verifies that all four universities mentioned in the PLAN (Harvard, Santa Clara, Morehouse, Georgetown) are present in the dataset, then uses standard geographic coordinates to determine longitude values for Cambridge MA (-71.1097°), Santa Clara CA (-121.9552°), Atlanta GA (-84.3880°), and Washington DC (-77.0369°). By sorting these coordinates, I can identify that Santa Clara, California is the westernmost city (most negative longitude at -121.9552°) and Cambridge, Massachusetts is the easternmost city (least negative longitude at -71.1097°). The final answer will be formatted as requested with westernmost city first: 'Santa Clara, Cambridge'.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements perfectly. The script successfully loaded the DHS Secretaries dataset, verified all four required universities are present (Harvard, Santa Clara, Morehouse, Georgetown), calculated accurate longitude coordinates for each city, and correctly identified Santa Clara, California as the westernmost city (-121.9552°) and Cambridge, Massachusetts as the easternmost city (-71.1097°). The geographic analysis was thorough and accurate, showing proper longitudinal sorting from west to east. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the final answer 'Santa Clara, Cambridge' is correctly formatted with westernmost city first. The analysis results were also properly saved to 'workspace/longitude_analysis.json' for future reference. No further development is needed.",
