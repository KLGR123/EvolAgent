## Plan Content
```
Using the comprehensive list of 5 confirmed DHS Secretaries and their bachelor's degree universities (Harvard College, Santa Clara University, Morehouse College, University of Massachusetts Boston), determine the geographic locations of these universities and identify which is the westernmost and which is the easternmost based on longitude coordinates. Create a final answer listing the cities in the requested format: westernmost city first, followed by easternmost city, comma-separated.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal next step because: (1) We have successfully identified all 5 confirmed DHS Secretaries and their bachelor's degree universities from the previous research, (2) The developer has provided complete educational background data for Tom Ridge, Michael Chertoff, Janet Napolitano, Jeh Johnson, and John F. Kelly, (3) Expected outcome is to determine the geographic positioning of Harvard (Cambridge), Santa Clara (Santa Clara), Morehouse (Atlanta), and UMass (Boston) to identify the westernmost and easternmost locations, (4) This directly completes the TASK by providing the final comma-separated city list as requested.

    "description": "This implementation determines the geographic locations of the 5 confirmed DHS Secretaries' bachelor's degree universities and identifies the westernmost and easternmost based on longitude coordinates. The analysis involves: (1) Defining the confirmed DHS Secretaries and their universities (Harvard College, Santa Clara University, Morehouse College, University of Massachusetts Boston), (2) Setting up geographic coordinates for each university location, (3) Comparing longitude values to find the westernmost (most negative) and easternmost (least negative) positions, (4) Extracting the corresponding city names, and (5) Creating the final answer in the requested format. The universities span from Santa Clara, California (westernmost at -121.9444° longitude) to Boston, Massachusetts (easternmost at -71.0380° longitude). The complete analysis with coordinates and intermediate results is saved to workspace/dhs_universities_geographic_analysis.json for reference.",
