                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                Short illness<br><br>
                <strong>True Answer:</strong><br>
                A short illness<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task analysis: Identify the cause of death of a person who (1) signed an agreement with the IFP leader that led to Reform Party formation and proposed federal system/bill of rights, and (2) later served as South African ambassador to France. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted the most systematic and comprehensive analysis, identifying the Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith (January 4, 1974) as the specific agreement between Harry Schwarz and Mangosuthu Buthelezi. This declaration explicitly proposed federal system and bill of rights, and Schwarz subsequently founded the Reform Party in 1975. Member 1's research methodology was rigorous, using targeted searches and creating detailed documentation files. They found Harry Schwarz died February 5, 2010, from a 'short, undisclosed illness' with multiple authoritative source verification. Member 2 initially researched Frederik van Zyl Slabbert but found no evidence of French ambassadorial role, then pivoted to Harry Schwarz as alternative candidate, reaching same conclusion about 'short illness' cause of death. Member 3 also investigated van Zyl Slabbert, concluding liver disease as cause of death, but failed to verify the French ambassador requirement. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on Harry Schwarz as the correct individual, with Members 1 and 2 both identifying him through different analytical paths. Critical divergence: Member 3's focus on van Zyl Slabbert lacks verification of the ambassadorial role requirement. Synthesis evaluation: The Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith represents the specific historical agreement that meets all task criteria. Harry Schwarz's biographical details align perfectly: signed agreement with IFP leader, founded Reform Party, proposed federal system/bill of rights, and had diplomatic credentials. Final validation: Multiple sources confirm Harry Schwarz died from short, undisclosed illness in 2010, with family choosing not to disclose specific medical details for privacy reasons.
