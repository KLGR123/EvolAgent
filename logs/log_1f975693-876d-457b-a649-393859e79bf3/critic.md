## Final Answer
```
132,133,134,197,245
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Extract page numbers from Professor Willowbrook's audio recording for Calculus mid-term study preparation, requiring audio transcription and numeric extraction formatted as comma-delimited list in ascending order. Member 0 evaluation: Used systematic audio processing workflow with Google Speech Recognition, producing comprehensive transcription and rigorous page number extraction. Identified pages 132, 133, 134 (related rates), 197 (integration), and 245 (differential equations) with clear sectional context. Final answer: 132,133,134,197,245. Member 1 evaluation: Successfully transcribed audio and extracted page numbers using regex patterns, but included questionable result '1197' alongside correct pages 197 and 245. Final answer: 197,245,1197. Shows incomplete extraction missing the 132-134 sequence. Member 2 evaluation: Performed audio analysis with enhanced regex patterns, initially identifying same pages as Member 0 but then inexplicably added '1197' to final result. Final answer: 132,133,134,197,245,1197. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on core pages 132,133,134,197,245 across members, with divergence on inclusion of '1197'. Evidence evaluation: Members 0's approach demonstrates highest methodological rigor with sectional context validation and no spurious additions. The '1197' appearing in other solutions likely represents transcription error or misinterpretation of '197'. Resolution: Member 0's systematic approach with contextual validation provides most reliable extraction. Final validation confirms 132,133,134,197,245 as complete and accurate page list for mid-term preparation.
