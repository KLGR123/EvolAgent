# Developer Plan #2 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 15:35:19

## Plan Content
```
Scan the transcript file workspace/homework_transcript.txt to identify all mentioned page numbers in Professor Willowbrook’s recommended reading and output the distinct page numbers as a comma-delimited list in ascending order.
```

## Plan Description
```
This plan is optimal because: (1) The transcript has been generated and saved at workspace/homework_transcript.txt, (2) The TASK requires extracting specific page numbers from the transcript, (3) Scanning the transcript for numeric page references will yield the required data, (4) Producing the numbers as a sorted, comma-delimited list directly satisfies the TASK requirement.
```
