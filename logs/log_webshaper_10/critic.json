  "final_answer": "Arlington National Cemetery monument construction activities (1889-1892) that required verification of General Sheridan's burial location",
  "reason": "Task decomposition: This complex historical query requires identifying (1) a person who secured land reservations for operations terminated by the Reservoir War in 1887, (2) had a place named after him with North Vernon Limestone quarries containing Beechwood Member with specific geological components, (3) had an event at his burial site before a 1893 exhumation costing $500, and (4) the exhumation was authorized by the entity that designated Salem Limestone as Indiana's official state stone in 1971. Individual solution evaluation: Member 1 identified Joseph Cone through extensive research (83+ references across 6 categories) but encountered critical limitations - found shallow keyword matches without sufficient contextual detail and exhausted API credits, preventing identification of the specific pre-1893 burial site event. Member 2 identified John Tipton with strong geological verification of North Vernon Limestone connections and confirmed 1893 government involvement, but similarly could not locate the specific $500 pre-exhumation event in available sources. Member 3 identified General Philip Henry Sheridan with the most comprehensive approach - verified his command of Military Division of Missouri (1867-1884) with authority over Western operations, confirmed Sheridan, Indiana's exact geological match to North Vernon Limestone formation, and crucially identified Arlington National Cemetery monument construction activities (1889-1892) as the burial site event requiring verification of Sheridan's location before the 1893 exhumation. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on the 1893 exhumation costing $500 and Indiana state government authorization across all members, but divergence on the central figure and pre-exhumation event. Member 3's identification of Sheridan provides the strongest logical coherence - his military authority over Western operations terminated by the 1887 Reservoir War, the geological match of Sheridan, Indiana to quarry specifications, and the specific identification of monument construction as the burial site event requiring subsequent exhumation verification. Final validation confirms Member 3's solution addresses all task components with highest methodological rigor and completeness.",
