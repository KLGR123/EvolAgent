## Task Description
```
What is the event, verified about the burial site of the person who secured land reservations for an operation terminated by the Reservoir War in 1887, had a place named after him that is the location of a quarry site producing North Vernon Limestone—which contains the Beechwood Member with crinoidal limestone and includes glauconite and phosphate—and occurred before an exhumation in 1893 involving his body, costing $500, and authorized by the entity that in 1971 enacted legislation designating Salem Limestone as the official state stone of Indiana?

### Who testified to convict two gang leaders tied to 1924–1934 robberies and a 1933 jailbreak?

**TASK**: What is the name of the person who provided testimony that helped convict two gang leaders—the leader of the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang, which committed bank robberies including their first major heist in Indiana in 1924 and a 1934 bank robbery (the last robbery participated in by John Dillinger) involving a black Hudson getaway car and prompting the city's police department to acquire a custom Studebaker car; and another leader who committed a crime during the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger, resulting in the death of a sheriff and leading to the conviction of Harry Pierpont?

All research objectives have been thoroughly documented: (1) Land treaties with Native Americans including the Treaty of Grouseland (1805) ceding 51 million acres and Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809) opposed by Tecumseh, totaling over 60 million acres acquired across multiple states, (2) Indiana place names including Harrison County established in 1808 during his territorial governorship with connections to the Indiana limestone belt, (3) Complete burial and exhumation history from his 1841 burial at North Bend Ohio through the 1878 grave robbing attempt to the 1922 reinterment in a 60-foot monument built with Indiana limestone, (4) Connections to later 19th century conflicts including how his treaty lands became the Union agricultural base during the Civil War and experienced post-war limestone quarrying boom, and (5) The historical relationships between his treaties, geographic legacy, economic development, and ongoing Native American conflicts. Three comprehensive files were created in workspace/: harrison_comprehensive_research.json (complete structured research data), harrison_detailed_analysis.txt (thorough analysis addressing all PLAN points), and harrison_historical_connections.txt (key relationships and legacy impacts). The research demonstrates clear connections between Harrison's territorial expansion through treaties, the naming of places like Harrison County, the development of the Indiana limestone industry, his burial site monument construction, and the long-term impacts on 19th century American conflicts and economic development. The tester confirmed complete PLAN fulfillment with extensive, well-organized historical documentation covering all specified research areas.",
