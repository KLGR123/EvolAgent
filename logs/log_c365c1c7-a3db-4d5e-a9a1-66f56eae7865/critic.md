## Final Answer
```
Braintree, Honolulu
```

## Reasoning
```
(1) Task decomposition: Identify U.S. presidential birth cities, determine westernmost (minimum longitude) and easternmost (maximum longitude) points, then list those two city names alphabetically, comma-separated. Success requires correct identification of extreme longitudes among presidents’ birthplaces and strict adherence to output formatting. (2) Individual evaluation: Member 1 identified North Bend and Hillsborough but miscalculated extremes—Hillsborough is not the easternmost. Member 2 correctly identified Honolulu as westernmost but selected Milton incorrectly as easternmost. Member 3 correctly geocoded all birth cities, identified Honolulu (–157.8557°) and Braintree (–71.0041°) as true westernmost and easternmost extremes, and adhered to distance and formatting requirements. (3) Cross-analysis: All members understood the need to geocode and compare longitudes. Divergence occurred in easternmost city selection—Members 1 and 2 erred in choosing Hillsborough and Milton due to incomplete data or rounding. Member 3’s approach used authoritative sources with precise coordinates, resolving contradictions. (4) Synthesis: Member 3’s methodology combines rigorous geocoding, thorough edge-case handling, and correct extreme identification. No additional components needed from other approaches. (5) Validation: Independent check of longitudes confirms Braintree is the easternmost and Honolulu the westernmost presidential birth cities. Alphabetical sorting yields “Braintree, Honolulu.” (6) Confidence: High confidence based on geographic data validation and consensus with authoritative coordinates. Evidence: Honolulu (–157.8557°), Braintree (–71.0041°).
