### Westernmost and Easternmost University Cities of DHS Secretariesâ€™ Bachelor Degrees (Before April 2019)

**TASK**: All of the individuals who formally held the position of United States secretary of homeland security prior to April 2019, excluding those who held the position in an acting capacity, have a bachelor's degree. Of the universities that these bachelor's degrees were from, which is the westernmost university and which is the easternmost university? Give them to me as a comma-separated list, I only want the name of the cities where the universities are located, with the westernmost city listed first.

### Alphabetized Botanical Vegetable List for Momâ€™s Strictly Categorized Grocery List

**TASK**: I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.
