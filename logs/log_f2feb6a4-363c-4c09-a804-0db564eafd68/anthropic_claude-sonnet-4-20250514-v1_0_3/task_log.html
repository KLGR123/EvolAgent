I live in Pearl City, Hawaii, which is on the island of Oahu. I know two homes near me that sold in 2022 were 2072 Akaikai Loop, and 2017 Komo Mai Drive. Find which of those homes sold for more in 2022, and tell me how much it sold for. Don’t put commas or decimal places in the answer.</p>
<p>Episodic Examples:<br>### Selecting Seahorse Island Full-House with Swimming for a Family Stay</p>
<p>**TASK**: The attached file lists accommodations in the resort town of Seahorse Island. Based on the information in this file, which seems like the better available place to stay for a family that enjoys swimming and wants a full house? Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/366e2f2b-8632-4ef2-81eb-bc3877489217.pdf</p>
<p>```<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/366e2f2b-8632-4ef2-81eb-bc3877489217.pdf to extract information about all accommodations in Seahorse Island. Focus on identifying properties that offer full house rentals and have swimming amenities (pools, beach access, or water features). Extract details including accommodation names, property types, amenities, availability status, and any family-friendly features to enable comparison of options suitable for a family seeking a full house with swimming facilities.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the accommodation listings and identify properties that meet the specific criteria of full house rentals with swimming amenities, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this PDF file, (3) Expected outcome is to have a comprehensive list of available accommodations with their amenities and property types clearly identified, (4) This provides the foundation needed to compare and recommend the best option for a family wanting a full house with swimming facilities&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The Seahorse Island accommodations analysis has been completed successfully according to the **PLAN** requirements. The implementation successfully parsed and analyzed the PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/366e2f2b-8632-4ef2-81eb-bc3877489217.pdf containing accommodation data for Seahorse Island.\n\n**EXECUTION RESULTS:**\n\n**Total Analysis Coverage:**\n- Successfully extracted and parsed all 25 accommodations from the PDF\n- Categorized properties into Hotels (5), Motels (5), Rental Houses (10), and Campgrounds (5)\n- Focused analysis on Rental Houses as requested for full house rentals\n\n**Swimming Amenities Analysis:**\n- Identified 4 rental houses with swimming amenities out of 10 total rental houses\n- Swimming amenities detected: Pool access (3 properties), Beach access (1 property), Water/Creek access (1 property)\n- Properties with swimming amenities: Ocean and Main, Shelley&#x27;s Place, Creakwood Creek, and Headrush Beach\n\n**Availability and Family Suitability Assessment:**\n- **Available with Swimming:** 1 property (Shelley&#x27;s Place - 4/5 stars with pool)\n- **Unavailable with Swimming:** 3 properties (Ocean and Main 5/5 stars, Creakwood Creek 3/5 stars, Headrush Beach 3/5 stars)\n- Family-friendly features identified: Kitchen facilities, entertainment options, privacy, and cleanliness\n- Potential concerns noted: Noise issues, property condition concerns, and basic accommodations\n\n**Key Findings for Family Planning:**\n- Only **Shelley&#x27;s Place** is currently available as a full house rental with swimming amenities (pool)\n- Rated 4/5 stars but has property condition concerns (creaky floorboards)\n- **Ocean and Main** would be the top choice (5/5 stars with pool) but currently has no vacancy\n- **Headrush Beach** offers unique private beach access but accommodations are described as &#x27;rough&#x27;\n\n**Output Files Created:**\n- workspace/seahorse_island_structured_analysis.json - Complete structured data analysis\n- workspace/family_swimming_house_recommendations.txt - Family-focused recommendation summary\n- workspace/seahorse_island_accommodations_raw.txt - Original PDF content\n\nThe analysis provides comprehensive information enabling families to compare options for full house rentals with swimming facilities on Seahorse Island, exactly as specified in the **PLAN**. All accommodation names, property types, amenities, availability status, and family-friendly features have been extracted and analyzed successfully.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &quot;Based on the comprehensive analysis of the Seahorse Island accommodations PDF, compare the available full house rental options with swimming amenities to determine which property would be the better choice for a family. Evaluate the single available option (Shelley&#x27;s Place) against the unavailable but higher-rated alternatives, and provide a clear recommendation considering factors like star ratings, swimming facilities, family-friendly features, and any potential concerns identified in the analysis.&quot;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have extracted all accommodation data showing only one available full house with swimming amenities (Shelley&#x27;s Place), (2) The core question about which is the &#x27;better available place&#x27; requires evaluation of the available options against the specific family criteria, (3) Expected outcome is a definitive recommendation with reasoning based on the extracted data, (4) This directly addresses the main TASK requirement to identify the better accommodation choice for a family wanting a full house with swimming facilities&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The comprehensive analysis of Seahorse Island accommodations has been successfully completed. Based on the detailed examination of all 4 full house rentals with swimming amenities, I provided a clear family recommendation:\n\n**FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Shelley&#x27;s Place**\n\n**Key Analysis Results:**\n- Total rental houses with swimming amenities: 4\n- Currently available with swimming: 1 (Shelley&#x27;s Place)\n- Rating: 4/5 stars with pool access\n- Main concern: Creaky floorboards mentioned in guest review\n\n**Comparative Analysis:**\n- Shelley&#x27;s Place (4/5 stars) is the ONLY available option\n- Ocean and Main (5/5 stars) is unavailable but higher-rated\n- Two other 3/5 star options are also unavailable\n- Pool access is safer for families than beach swimming\n\n**Family-Specific Considerations:**\n- Provided practical packing tips (soft slippers, white noise machines)\n- Identified sleep quality concerns from creaky floors\n- Recommended quiet hours rules for children\n- Emphasized safety benefits of private pool access\n\n**Output Files Created:**\n- workspace/final_family_recommendation.json: Detailed recommendation with competitive analysis\n- Comprehensive family packing tips and house rules suggestions\n\n**Conclusion:** Despite the flooring noise issue, Shelley&#x27;s Place is the clear choice as it&#x27;s the only available full house rental with swimming amenities. The 4/5 rating indicates generally positive experiences, and with proper preparation (noise mitigation strategies), it will serve families well.

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the Seahorse Island accommodations PDF: (1) All 25 accommodations were analyzed, with focus on the 10 rental houses to identify full house options, (2) Of the 4 rental houses with swimming amenities, only Shelley&#x27;s Place is currently available, (3) Shelley&#x27;s Place offers a 4/5 star rating with pool access, making it safer for families than beach swimming options, (4) While it has minor concerns about creaky floorboards, it&#x27;s the clear choice as the only available full house with swimming facilities.

<p>### List Pre-2020 US Zip Codes for Invasive Clownfish Sightings</p>
<p>**TASK**: I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.</p>
<p>```<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Identify the main character fish species from the movie Finding Nemo and then search for USGS databases or reports documenting nonnative fish species occurrences in the United States before 2020. Focus on finding official USGS records that include specific location data with zip codes for where this species was found as an invasive or nonnative population.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to first confirm the fish species from Finding Nemo (likely clownfish/Amphiprioninae) and then locate USGS nonnative species databases, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this topic, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the target species and find USGS documentation of nonnative occurrences with geographic specificity, (4) This directly targets finding the zip code locations where the species was documented as nonnative before 2020 as requested in the TASK&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;PLAN objective has been successfully completed. The implementation achieved all required components: (1) Identified the main character fish species from Finding Nemo as Amphiprion ocellaris (clown anemonefish), (2) Successfully accessed the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Database and located species profile with ID 3243, (3) Found a documented nonnative occurrence record (Specimen ID: 1468741) from 2018 in Florida, which satisfies the &#x27;before 2020&#x27; requirement, (4) Extracted specific location data including Pinellas County and Fred Howard Park locality that provides sufficient information for ZIP code identification (Holiday, FL area: ZIP codes 34690-34691). The final comprehensive analysis was saved to workspace/finding_nemo_clownfish_usgs_complete_analysis.json with complete documentation of the specimen record, location details, and ZIP code conversion potential. The USGS record confirms this was a managed nonnative population (status: eradicated), validating the nonnative species requirement. All PLAN objectives have been verified and documented with official USGS data sources.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Convert the Florida location data from the USGS record (Pinellas County, Fred Howard Park area in Holiday, FL) to the specific five-digit ZIP codes for that geographic area. Cross-reference multiple sources including USPS ZIP code databases, local government records, and mapping services to ensure accuracy of the ZIP codes covering the Fred Howard Park and Holiday, Florida region where the clownfish specimen was documented.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the necessary next step because: (1) The developer successfully identified the clownfish species and found the USGS nonnative occurrence record from 2018 in Florida, (2) The location data shows Pinellas County/Fred Howard Park/Holiday FL area with potential ZIP codes 34690-34691, but we need to verify the exact ZIP codes for the documented location, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the precise five-digit ZIP codes where the nonnative clownfish was found according to USGS records, (4) This completes the TASK by providing the required ZIP code format for the answer.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;The PLAN has been successfully completed. The code has successfully converted the Florida USGS location data (Pinellas County, Fred Howard Park area in Holiday, FL) to specific five-digit ZIP codes covering that geographic area. The execution results show:\n\n**Task Completion Summary:**\n1. **Location Research**: Successfully identified the target location as Fred Howard Park area in Holiday, FL, Pinellas County\n2. **ZIP Code Identification**: Found 3 five-digit ZIP codes covering the area:\n   - 34689: Fred Howard Park entrance area (1700 Sunset Point Rd, Tarpon Springs)\n   - 34690: Primary ZIP code for Holiday, FL\n   - 34691: Secondary ZIP code for Holiday, FL area\n3. **Validation**: All ZIP codes validated as proper 5-digit formats using regex\n4. **Cross-referencing**: Used multiple sources including USPS data, local government records, and geographic mapping to ensure accuracy\n5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive details gathered for each ZIP code including coverage areas and relationship to Fred Howard Park\n6. **Output**: Results saved to workspace/florida_zip_codes.json with complete metadata\n\n**Files Created:**\n- workspace/florida_zip_codes.json: Contains complete ZIP code mapping with detailed information, summary data, and verification that all three ZIP codes cover the Fred Howard Park area where the clownfish specimen was documented\n\n**Final Result:** The three five-digit ZIP codes (34689, 34690, 34691) successfully represent the geographic area specified in the USGS record for the clownfish specimen location. The task has been completed with 100% PLAN alignment as confirmed by the tester feedback.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted: (1) Identified the main character fish from Finding Nemo as Amphiprion ocellaris (clown anemonefish), (2) Located USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database record (Specimen ID: 1468741) documenting a nonnative occurrence in 2018 in Florida, which meets the &#x27;before 2020&#x27; requirement, (3) Converted the location data (Pinellas County, Fred Howard Park area in Holiday, FL) to specific five-digit ZIP codes covering that geographic area.

<p>### Development Step 3: Comparing Seahorse Island Pool Rentals for Families: Shelley&#x27;s Place vs Top-Rated Houses</p>
<p>**Description**: Based on the comprehensive analysis of the Seahorse Island accommodations PDF, compare the available full house rental options with swimming amenities to determine which property would be the better choice for a family. Evaluate the single available option (Shelley&#x27;s Place) against the unavailable but higher-rated alternatives, and provide a clear recommendation considering factors like star ratings, swimming facilities, family-friendly features, and any potential concerns identified in the analysis.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Automated extraction and comparison of swimming amenities and star ratings from multiple resort PDF brochures to recommend the best family-friendly rental on Seahorse Island for a travel agency’s booking system<br>- Backend integration in a holiday rental platform that ingests property listing PDFs, parses JSON summaries of amenities, and flags unavailable but highly rated alternatives for customer upsell opportunities<br>- Data pipeline for a real estate analytics startup that scans regional vacation home brochures in PDF form, structures the details into JSON, and outputs a ranked list of family-oriented full-house rentals with pools<br>- Research tool for hospitality management scholars to batch-process accommodation catalogs, quantify amenity distributions (e.g., swimming pools), and analyze rating disparities between available and premium properties<br>- Internal audit automation in a hotel chain that reads facility and service summary PDFs, verifies compliance with family-safety standards around swimming areas, and generates a pass/fail report<br>- Tourism board dashboard that aggregates PDF listings of island properties, extracts key family-friendly features (star rating, pool size, kid zones), and visualizes a geographic heatmap of recommended rentals<br>- Feature enhancement for a mobile travel app that auto-imports PDF vacation guides, builds JSON property profiles, and presents users with a side-by-side recommendation highlighting the top pick for families on Seahorse Island</p>

<p>### Development Step 2: Find City with October 2019 Planning Permission for Homeless Shelter-to-Flats Conversion</p>
<p>**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the city where a developer received planning permission in October 2019 to convert a homeless shelter into flats. Focus on searching for news articles, planning applications, and local government records from October 2019 using keywords like &#x27;October 2019 planning permission homeless shelter flats conversion&#x27;, &#x27;homeless shelter converted flats October 2019&#x27;, and &#x27;planning permission shelter housing development 2019&#x27;. Cross-reference results with locations that have Bournemouth Seafront areas containing Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th century historic villas, and conservation areas designated in 1987.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Real estate investment due diligence: automatically extract and verify October 2019 planning permissions for property conversions (e.g., homeless shelter to flats) to assess redevelopment opportunities in Bournemouth and similar coastal towns<br>- Urban planning research and heritage conservation: cross-reference local government records with landmark datasets (Russell-Cotes Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th-century villas) to study the impact of conservation areas designated in 1987 on new developments<br>- Automated news media fact-checking: scan and analyze web articles for developer names, planning permission dates, and locations to validate claims about high-profile projects (e.g., Harry Redknapp’s Pierfront Properties approval)<br>- Government transparency dashboards: aggregate and visualize planning application outcomes by date, developer, and city (such as Bournemouth in October 2019) to support public policy analysis and citizen engagement<br>- Legal property compliance monitoring: track the approval status of planning permissions for former homeless accommodations to ensure developers comply with council conditions and heritage requirements<br>- Tourism and cultural guide enrichment: verify the presence of specific landmarks and recent development changes (flats conversion, conservation areas) when generating up-to-date travel guides for Bournemouth’s seafront attractions<br>- Social impact assessment for NGOs: compile and analyze data on shelter-to-housing conversion projects approved in 2019 to report on local homelessness alleviation efforts and inform funding decisions</p>

This search strategy uses 9 targeted queries covering multiple angles including direct property searches, real estate platform searches (Zillow, Realtor.com), and Hawaii county property records. The code implements relevance scoring based on 12 key indicators including property addresses, sale-related terms, year 2022, and trusted real estate sources. Results are automatically categorized by relevance score and saved to a timestamped JSON file for detailed analysis. This establishes the foundation for extracting specific 2022 sale prices to determine which property sold for more money.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed comprehensive property search for both Pearl City addresses. The search generated 90 results across 9 targeted queries and successfully identified key sale information for both properties. From the output, I can see clear sale data: 2072 Akaikai Loop sold on 12/14/2022 for $860,000 (confirmed by multiple sources including Trulia, Ocean Regroup, and Hawaii House), and 2017 Komo Mai Drive sold on 8/17/2023 for $1,080,000 and also on 8/5/2022 for $900,000. The search results show 2017 Komo Mai Drive had higher sale prices than 2072 Akaikai Loop.
