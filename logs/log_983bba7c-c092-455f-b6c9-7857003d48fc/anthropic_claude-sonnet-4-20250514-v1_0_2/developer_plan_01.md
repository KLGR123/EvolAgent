# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for academic papers by Ilias Lagkouvardos and Olga Tapia that discuss the alvei species of a genus named after Copenhagen. Focus on identifying the specific genus (likely Hafnia, named after Copenhagen's Latin name Hafnia) and locate their respective research papers that mention Hafnia alvei or related alvei species. Extract information about animals mentioned in these papers outside of the bibliography sections to establish the baseline list of animals discussed by both authors.

## Description
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific genus named after Copenhagen (most likely Hafnia) and locate papers by both Lagkouvardos and Tapia discussing the alvei species, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find academic publications by both authors and extract animal mentions from their main content, (4) This establishes the foundation for later cross-referencing with the 2021 multicenter study cited on the alvei species' Wikipedia page

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Identify Emily Midkiff’s June 2014 dragon depictions article in Fafnir Journal

**Description**: Search for information about Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article, focusing on identifying the journal named after one of Hreidmar's sons from Norse mythology. Research Hreidmar's sons (Fafnir, Regin, and Otr) to determine which one has a journal named after them, then locate Midkiff's specific article from June 2014 that discusses dragon depictions and contains quotes from two different authors expressing distaste.

**Use Cases**:
- Digital humanities research for medieval literature scholars: automating retrieval of articles on Norse mythology from niche journals (e.g., “Fáfnir Journal”), then extracting critical commentary quotes for a comparative analysis thesis
- Legal case preparation by law firms: scanning law reviews named after prominent jurists to find analyses of recent Supreme Court decisions, filtering and extracting dissenting judge quotes for briefings
- Pharmaceutical regulatory monitoring: searching clinical trial publications in specialty journals named after key compounds, identifying and extracting researcher statements on adverse events for safety reporting
- Competitive intelligence in tech R&D: aggregating engineering and patent‐focused articles from journals named after inventors, scraping and ranking passages where competitors critique hardware performance
- Financial market analysis for investment teams: locating macroeconomics papers in journals named after Nobel laureates, extracting risk assessment quotes by leading economists for client reports
- Marketing insight gathering for consumer goods: crawling enthusiast blogs and product forums named after brand mascots, filtering posts for negative feedback and extracting representative customer complaints
- Environmental policy research for NGOs: compiling ecological impact studies in region‐specific environmental journals, extracting scientist warnings on biodiversity loss for advocacy materials
- Genealogical and heritage studies by amateur historians: finding family‐history articles in society journals named after ancestral clans, pulling out firsthand narratives and dispute accounts for published family trees

### Development Step 2: Locate Nedoshivina 2010 paper on Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov, including methods and repository info

**Description**: Search for Nedoshivina's 2010 scientific paper that includes descriptions of Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov. Focus on finding the complete publication with methods/materials sections or specimen repository information. Use these search approaches: (1) Academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or ResearchGate using keywords 'Nedoshivina 2010 Vietnamese specimens Kuznetzov', (2) Taxonomic databases that might reference specimen deposits, (3) Journal archives that published the paper in 2010. Look specifically for sections mentioning specimen deposition, museum collections, or institutional repositories where the Vietnamese materials were stored.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum curators automatically extracting specimen deposition details from Nedoshivina’s 2010 catalogue to update and verify their Tortricidae collection database at ZISP
- Biodiversity informaticians harvesting Vietnamese Tortricidae origin and repository metadata from published PDFs to integrate into a global species occurrence platform
- Academic researchers conducting a meta‐analysis of Tortricidae diversity by programmatically discovering, downloading, and parsing type specimen catalogues from online archives
- Digital librarians automating the discovery and archiving of obscure entomological publications in Atalanta to ensure complete institutional repository holdings
- Grant administrators monitoring open‐access compliance by locating and validating full‐text taxonomic papers in Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and journal archives
- Conservation biologists retrieving museum accession numbers and collection localities from PDF methods sections to model habitat suitability for endangered moth species
- Systematics PhD students streamlining their literature reviews by scraping abstracts, methods/materials, and repository information from historical taxonomic papers
- Data journalists investigating transparency in specimen reporting by aggregating repository details from multiple scientific databases into an interactive dashboard

### Development Step 12: Locate Emily Midkiff’s June 2014 dragon article and identify the Norse son–named journal.

**Description**: Search for information about Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article, focusing on identifying the journal named after one of Hreidmar's sons from Norse mythology. Research Hreidmar's sons (Fafnir, Regin, and Otr) to determine which one has a journal named after them, then locate Midkiff's specific article from June 2014 that discusses dragon depictions and contains quotes from two different authors expressing distaste.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic researchers in Norse mythology leveraging automated archive scraping to retrieve Emily Midkiff’s June 2014 Fafnir article on dragon depictions for a thematic analysis in a peer-reviewed paper
- University library staff automating the collection and indexing of all 2014 issues from Fafnir Journal to maintain up-to-date institutional repositories and facilitate student access
- Graduate students in digital humanities using targeted web scraping to extract full-text content and metadata of fantasy scholarship for machine-assisted textual analysis of dragon symbolism
- Bibliometric analysts aggregating issue-level publication and authorship data from Fafnir to chart research trends in Nordic science fiction journals over the past decade
- Educational technology developers building a plugin that auto-fetches and summarizes relevant articles from Fafnir based on user-defined keywords for interactive classroom presentations
- Cultural heritage projects extracting quotes and images from specialized journals like Fafnir to create multimedia exhibits on Norse mythological creatures in museum installations
- Academic publishers deploying automated link validation and content archiving workflows on genre-specific journal websites to ensure long-term digital preservation compliance
- Scientific content curation services monitoring Fafnir’s archives for new publications on speculative fiction to include in weekly newsletters tailored to fantasy literature scholars

### Development Step 1: Find Nedoshivina 2010 Publication Describing Kuznetzov’s Vietnamese Specimens, Including Methods and Repository Info

**Description**: Search for Nedoshivina's 2010 scientific paper that includes descriptions of Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov. Focus on finding the complete publication with methods/materials sections or specimen repository information. Use these search approaches: (1) Academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or ResearchGate using keywords 'Nedoshivina 2010 Vietnamese specimens Kuznetzov', (2) Taxonomic databases that might reference specimen deposits, (3) Journal archives that published the paper in 2010. Look specifically for sections mentioning specimen deposition, museum collections, or institutional repositories where the Vietnamese materials were stored.

**Use Cases**:
- Entomology researcher retrieving Nedoshivina’s 2010 paper to verify Vietnamese veneer moth specimen depositories before describing a new related species
- Museum curator cross-referencing taxonomic literature to confirm the institutional repository and accession numbers of Kuznetzov’s Vietnam collection for database curation
- Graduate student compiling methods and material details from primary sources to support a molecular phylogeny of Southeast Asian Tortricidae
- Biodiversity informatics specialist automating DOI and PDF link extraction for taxonomic publications to integrate specimen metadata into an online species portal
- Conservation biologist mapping historical specimen localities in Vietnam by extracting georeferenced collection data from Nedoshivina’s publication
- Journal editor validating author-provided repository statements against original publications to ensure compliance with taxonomic code requirements
- Natural history collection manager updating digital catalogs by linking specimen records to their original taxonomic descriptions and museum holdings
- Academic librarian indexing obscure entomological articles in digital archives, using SerpAPI to locate full-text PDFs and DOIs for 2010 publications
