                Task analysis: Identify the specific command clicked in the last video of a 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com to remove extra lines. Member 1 conducted extensive video frame analysis of a specific replit.com blog post video, systematically extracting and enhancing frames around the 7.30-second mark where command execution occurred. Despite sophisticated image enhancement and GPT-4o vision analysis, no visible command palette interface was detected, leading to the conclusion that Ctrl+Shift+K (Delete current line) was executed via keyboard shortcut. However, this conclusion was based on inference rather than visual confirmation from the video. Member 2 performed exhaustive searches across replit.com and alternative platforms, analyzing over 1MB of content across multiple methodologies, but definitively concluded that the specified 2018 VSCode blog post does not exist in any publicly accessible form. This thorough approach covered current blog infrastructure, archives, and alternative platforms with high confidence. Member 3 took a different approach by locating archived 2018 VSCode blog posts through Wayback Machine, successfully downloading and analyzing 9 HTML files containing actual VSCode release documentation from 2018. Through systematic analysis of the archived content, they identified the 'last video' as the June 2018 VSCode highlights video and extracted detailed documentation showing the Find and Replace with Regular Expression method (Ctrl+H with regex pattern '^\s*$\n') for removing empty lines. Cross-analysis reveals significant divergence: Members 1 and 2 either found non-existent content or concluded the blog post doesn't exist, while Member 3 successfully located archived VSCode content and provided a complete, technically accurate solution. Member 3's approach demonstrates superior research methodology by utilizing web archives and provides the most comprehensive and technically sound answer with complete step-by-step documentation.
