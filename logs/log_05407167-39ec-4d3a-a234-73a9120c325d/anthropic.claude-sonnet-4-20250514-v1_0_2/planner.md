### Unlambda code: which character to add to output “For penguins”?

**TASK**: In Unlambda, what exact charcter or text needs to be added to correct the following code to output "For penguins"? If what is needed is a character, answer with the name of the character. If there are different names for the character, use the shortest. The text location is not needed. Code:

    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": 'Research and analyze the Unlambda programming language to understand its syntax, specifically focusing on code structure that would output text strings like "For penguins".',
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand Unlambda's syntax to identify what's missing in the given code, (2) No prior research has been done on this language yet, (3) Expected outcome is to gain sufficient knowledge about Unlambda to analyze the provided code snippet, (4) Understanding the language fundamentals is critical before we can determine what character needs to be added to fix the code.",

    "description": 'The task has been successfully completed. I\'ve provided a comprehensive implementation that researches and analyzes the Unlambda programming language, with specific focus on understanding syntax for outputting text strings like "For penguins".\n\nThe code successfully created:\n1. A syntax reference document explaining Unlambda\'s core operators and principles\n2. A "Hello, World!" example with detailed explanation\n3. Two different implementations for outputting "For penguins" in Unlambda\n4. Additional examples showing different output patterns\n5. A comprehensive summary of findings\n\nThe key finding is that in Unlambda, to output a text string like "For penguins", we use the `.c` operator to print each character and chain these operations using the backtick (`) application operator. The complete solution is:\n``.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i\n\nAs confirmed by the tester\'s feedback, the code executed successfully and fully met the requirements specified in the PLAN. All necessary files were generated in the workspace directory, and the implementation thoroughly demonstrates how to create Unlambda code that outputs the desired text string.',

    "description": "Task completed successfully. After analyzing the Unlambda code, I've identified that the exact character needed to fix the code is the backtick (`). The given code lacks backticks between the dot operators. In Unlambda, `.c` prints character c, but these operations need to be connected with backticks (`) as application operators. The correct format should be: `.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i. Final answer: backtick",

### Determining the Highest Number of Bird Species Seen Simultaneously in a YouTube Video

**TASK**: In the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM, what is the highest number of bird species to be on camera simultaneously?

The analysis processed all 61 extracted frames, found birds in 59 frames (96.7%), with Giant Petrels appearing most frequently (83.6% of frames), followed by Emperor Penguins (16.4%) and Adelie Penguins (3.3%). Comprehensive results saved to 'bird_species_analysis_results.json' with detailed frame-by-frame analysis, species occurrence statistics, and methodology documentation. The **PLAN** objective to 'identify and count bird species visible simultaneously throughout the video and determine the maximum number of different bird species visible in any single moment or frame' has been completely fulfilled.",

### Determine hex color of 11th move landing cell on Excel grid avoiding blue cells

**TASK**: You are given this Excel file as a map. You start on the START cell and move toward the END cell. You are allowed to move two cells per turn, and you may move up, down, left, or right. You may not move fewer than two cells, and you may not move backward. You must avoid moving onto any blue cells. On the eleventh turn, what is the 6-digit hex code (without prefix) of the color of the cell where you land after moving?
