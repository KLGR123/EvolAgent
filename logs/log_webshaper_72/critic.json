  "true_answer": "George Bell and Sons",
  "reason": "Task decomposition: This complex research task required identifying (1) an author meeting six specific biographical criteria, (2) their book analyzing European peace ending in 1846 with specific diplomatic events, and (3) the publisher of its 1877-1878 four-volume edition. All three members correctly identified Harriet Martineau as the author through systematic verification of her use of bedcradle, vegetarianism, authorship of 'How to Observe Morals and Manners', translation of Comte's 'Cours de Philosophie Positive', creation of 'The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte', and Comte's criticism of her work. All members also correctly identified her book 'The History of England During the Thirty Years' Peace: 1816-1846' as covering the specified period and diplomatic events including the Convention of London 1840. However, members diverged on the publisher identification: Member 1 provided concrete bibliographic evidence from search results explicitly showing 'George Bell and Sons, 1877' with direct citation 'A History of the Thirty Years' Peace: A.D. 1816-1846 : in Four Volumes. (From 1830-1841), Volume 3 Harriet Martineau George Bell and Sons, 1877'. Member 2 reached the same conclusion through multiple independent sources from academic databases and library catalogs. Member 3 concluded 'Longmans, Green, and Co' based on historical analysis of Victorian publishing patterns but without specific bibliographic evidence. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on George Bell and Sons from Members 1 and 2 with concrete evidence, while Member 3's conclusion relies on inferential analysis. Integration assessment: Members 1 and 2's bibliographic evidence provides definitive verification, with Member 1 showing the most systematic documentation of actual catalog entries and search results containing explicit publisher identification.",
