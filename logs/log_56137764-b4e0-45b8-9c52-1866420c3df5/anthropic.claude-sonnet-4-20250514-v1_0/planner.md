This code loads and displays the comprehensive final answer file that was created in the previous step, verifying all research findings and confirming the answer to the PLAN question. The analysis confirms that: (1) The firm is currently known as 'Holabird & Root' as of June 2023, having evolved from 'Holabird & Roche', (2) 'Holabird' appears first in the firm name and refers to founder William Holabird (1854-1923), (3) Therefore 'William' is the first name appearing in the firm designation. The verification includes checking all evidence sources (official website, 2023 references, government sources), historical context (firm evolution timeline), and a complete verification checklist. The research successfully answers the PLAN requirement with strong documentation from multiple authoritative sources including the firm's official website (holabird.com), 2023 social media references, and government records confirming William Holabird as the founder. Task status: COMPLETED with definitive answer 'William'.",
