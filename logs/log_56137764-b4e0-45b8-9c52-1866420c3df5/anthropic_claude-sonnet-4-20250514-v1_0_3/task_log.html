The comprehensive web search and analysis have successfully identified China\&#x27;s significant economic event in 1997. Based on the thorough analysis of 96 search results from multiple search engines, the findings are conclusive:\n\n**PRIMARY FINDING**: The significant economic event that China faced in 1997 was the **ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS**.\n\n**KEY EVIDENCE**:\n1. **Highest-scoring result (8/10)** from Indonesia\&#x27;s Finance Ministry document confirms: &quot;Massive infrastructure investment in China began especially after 1997 crisis where Chinese Government pushed out a stimulus plan to maintain post-crisis economic growth.&quot;\n\n2. **28 search results** specifically mentioned the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, establishing clear historical context.\n\n3. **Crisis Timeline**: The crisis began in Thailand in July 1997 when the Thai baht was floated, then spread across Asia affecting multiple economies.\n\n4. **China\&#x27;s Response**: Unlike many Asian neighbors, China was relatively protected due to its closed capital account and fixed exchange rate, but still implemented infrastructure investment and stimulus measures to maintain economic growth.\n\n**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**: The specific &quot;287 billion yuan&quot; figure mentioned in the PLAN appears to be from more recent Chinese infrastructure projects (found 4 mentions of this amount in contemporary contexts), not from 1997. However, the core research objective has been achieved - the 1997 economic event that prompted China\&#x27;s major construction and infrastructure investments was definitively identified as the Asian Financial Crisis.\n\n**FILES CREATED**:\n- `workspace/china_1997_economic_event_search_results.json`: Complete search results from 8 comprehensive queries across multiple search engines\n- `workspace/china_1997_economic_event_analysis.json`: Detailed analysis summary with categorized findings and conclusions\n\nThe PLAN has been fully executed and the research question answered with high confidence based on extensive web search evidence.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted by the developer, the significant economic event that China faced in 1997 has been definitively identified as the Asian Financial Crisis. The research analyzed 96 search results and found conclusive evidence that: (1) The Asian Financial Crisis began in July 1997 when Thailand floated the Thai baht and spread across Asia, (2) China responded with infrastructure investment and stimulus measures to maintain economic growth during this crisis period, (3) Multiple authoritative sources confirmed that China&#x27;s massive infrastructure investments began especially after the 1997 crisis as part of a government stimulus plan. While the specific 287 billion yuan figure appears to reference more recent projects, the core economic event of 1997 that prompted China&#x27;s major construction project allocations was clearly the Asian Financial Crisis. Final answer: Asian Financial Crisis.&quot;,<br>}<br>```</p>

<p>Description: This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific OpenCV version that added Mask-RCNN support before we can find contributors, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to determine when Mask-RCNN was integrated into OpenCV and identify preliminary contributor information, (4) This directly addresses the first part of the TASK requirement to find the relevant OpenCV version and its contributors</p>
<p>Episodic Examples:<br>### Development Step 7: Identify oldest closed numpy.polynomial &#x27;Regression&#x27; issue and its creation, closure, and label-add dates</p>
<p>**Description**: Search GitHub for numpy.polynomial issues to identify all closed issues that have the &#x27;Regression&#x27; label. Focus on finding the oldest closed issue with this label and determine when the &#x27;Regression&#x27; label was added to that specific issue. Use GitHub&#x27;s issue search functionality with filters for repository &#x27;numpy/numpy&#x27;, path &#x27;polynomial&#x27;, status &#x27;closed&#x27;, and label &#x27;Regression&#x27;. Extract the issue creation date, closure date, and label addition timestamp for the oldest matching issue.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Open source maintainers integrating automated GitHub API scripts to detect when the ‘Regression’ label is added to numpy.polynomial issues, ensuring timely backporting into long-term support (LTS) releases<br>- A data science research team auditing the stability of polynomial fitting methods by retrieving creation, closure, and regression label timestamps from numpy issues, supporting reproducibility in scientific publications<br>- DevOps engineers scheduling nightly CI jobs to flag newly closed numpy.polynomial regression issues and post alerts in Slack, accelerating triage for critical numerical library defects<br>- QA managers generating custom dashboards of closed regression issues in numpy.polynomial, measuring average time from issue creation to label application to improve testing SLAs<br>- Software architects analyzing historical labeling trends in numpy.polynomial to prioritize targeted refactoring and reduce future regression risk in core numerical modules<br>- Compliance auditors extracting detailed issue timelines for numpy.polynomial regressions to demonstrate adherence to internal defect management policies during software quality audits<br>- Community coordinators organizing focused bug-fix sprints by identifying the oldest labeled regression issues in numpy.polynomial, streamlining contributor efforts during open-source weekends<br>- Product owners tracking regression‐related issue resolution metrics in numpy.polynomial to inform roadmap decisions for feature deprecation and API stabilization</p>

<p>### Development Step 10: Identify oldest closed numpy.polynomial Regression issue; retrieve its creation, closure, and label-add timestamps</p>
<p>**Description**: Search GitHub for numpy.polynomial issues to identify all closed issues that have the &#x27;Regression&#x27; label. Focus on finding the oldest closed issue with this label and determine when the &#x27;Regression&#x27; label was added to that specific issue. Use GitHub&#x27;s issue search functionality with filters for repository &#x27;numpy/numpy&#x27;, path &#x27;polynomial&#x27;, status &#x27;closed&#x27;, and label &#x27;Regression&#x27;. Extract the issue creation date, closure date, and label addition timestamp for the oldest matching issue.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Python library maintainers auditing the numpy.polynomial module’s regression history to enforce SLAs on bug resolution<br>- DevOps teams integrating regression label detection into CI/CD pipelines to trigger alerts when critical polynomial functions break<br>- Open source project managers generating automated release notes by extracting timeline data for regression fixes in numpy<br>- Academic researchers studying bug-fix latency in scientific computing libraries by analyzing label addition and closure timestamps<br>- Financial compliance officers tracking third-party dependency regressions to maintain audit trails for regulatory reporting<br>- Software engineering leads comparing time-to-resolution metrics for regression issues across modules to optimize triage workflows<br>- Continuous integration engineers automating the detection of newly labeled regressions in polynomial code to prevent unstable releases<br>- Technical writers extracting detailed regression fix timelines to update user guides and troubleshooting documentation</p>

Key findings include identifying the earliest commit (August 24, 2018) by Dmitry Kurtaev that added Mask-RCNN support via pull request #12243. The GitHub API searches for commits worked well, finding 13 total commits with the oldest being from 2018-08-24. However, the execution was cut off during Step 2 while searching for issues and pull requests, so the research is incomplete. The code was progressing through the planned steps (commits search completed, issues/PRs search started, releases search pending) but didn&#x27;t finish all data collection phases. PLAN alignment: ~40% complete - found the key initial implementation date and primary contributor, but missing issues/PRs analysis and release notes review. Next step: Continue execution from where it stopped to complete the issues/PRs search and releases analysis, then save the comprehensive results to workspace files as planned.</p></div>

The code successfully analyzed previous research results from the workspace, identified the key findings, and provided a definitive answer. Key accomplishments: (1) Successfully loaded and analyzed the previous research file containing 13 commits and 74 issues/PRs, (2) Identified the first Mask-RCNN implementation on August 24, 2018, by Dmitry Kurtaev via Pull Request #12243, (3) Generated comprehensive findings with detailed timeline and contributor information, (4) Created both JSON data file and human-readable summary report in the workspace, (5) Provided clear final answer with specific date, author, and implementation details. The research objective has been fully achieved - we now know that Mask-RCNN model support was first added to OpenCV on August 24, 2018, implemented by Dmitry Kurtaev in the DNN module for TensorFlow Mask-RCNN models. PLAN alignment: 100% complete. No further development is needed as the research question has been definitively answered with supporting documentation saved to workspace files.</p></div>

This initial implementation searches GitHub for commits, issues, pull requests, and releases mentioning Mask-RCNN across both the main OpenCV repository and opencv_contrib repository. The approach uses multiple search queries to catch different naming variations (Mask-RCNN, MaskRCNN, mask rcnn) and sorts results chronologically to identify the earliest mentions. The code searches for commits using GitHub&#x27;s commit search API, then looks for related issues and pull requests, and finally examines OpenCV releases for official announcements. All results are saved to JSON files in the workspace for detailed analysis. This systematic approach will help identify not just when the feature was added, but also the contributors and development timeline involved in implementing Mask-RCNN support in OpenCV.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution partially successful - The code ran without errors and successfully discovered valuable information about Mask-RCNN support in OpenCV. Key findings include identifying the earliest commit (August 24, 2018) by Dmitry Kurtaev that added Mask-RCNN support via pull request #12243. The GitHub API searches for commits worked well, finding 13 total commits with the oldest being from 2018-08-24. However, the execution was cut off during Step 2 while searching for issues and pull requests, so the research is incomplete. The code was progressing through the planned steps (commits search completed, issues/PRs search started, releases search pending) but didn&#x27;t finish all data collection phases. PLAN alignment: ~40% complete - found the key initial implementation date and primary contributor, but missing issues/PRs analysis and release notes review. Next step: Continue execution from where it stopped to complete the issues/PRs search and releases analysis, then save the comprehensive results to workspace files as planned.&quot;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &#x27;Code Output: \n\n=== OPENCV MASK-RCNN SUPPORT RESEARCH ===\nObjective: Find when Mask-RCNN model support was added to OpenCV\nFocus: OpenCV release notes, changelogs, GitHub commits, and documentation\n\nUsing workspace directory: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5\n\n=== STEP 1: SEARCH GITHUB COMMITS FOR MASK-RCNN ===\n\nSearching commits with query: repo:opencv/opencv Mask-RCNN\nResponse status: 200\nFound 6 commits\nRetrieved 6 commits in this page\n\nCommit: 472b71ec\nDate: 2018-08-24T14:47:32.000+03:00\nAuthor: Dmitry Kurtaev\nMessage: Merge pull request #12243 from dkurt:dnn_tf_mask_rcnn\n\n* Support Mask-RCNN from TensorFlow\r\n\r\n* Fix ...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/472b71eceff52681222834545d85c36c7227f977\n\nCommit: 1a27ff45\nDate: 2018-11-13T13:22:39.000+03:00\nAuthor: Dmitry Kurtaev\nMessage: Update Mask-RCNN networks generator...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/1a27ff451809842bb7716102bca4e2a733d6e646\n\nCommit: 94d7c0f7\nDate: 2018-11-19T15:55:35.000Z\nAuthor: Alexander Alekhin\nMessage: Merge pull request #13144 from dkurt:update_tf_mask_rcnn...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/94d7c0f7f5527459959f2a8451055da0993b6b65\n\nCommit: 6ad3bf31\nDate: 2019-02-06T13:05:11.000+03:00\nAuthor: Dmitry Kurtaev\nMessage: Enable ResNet-based Mask-RCNN models from TensorFlow Object Detection API...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/6ad3bf31303378bdaa26a4829359ea14633a2c55\n\nCommit: 5e2a81dc\nDate: 2019-02-08T15:23:46.000Z\nAuthor: Alexander Alekhin\nMessage: Merge pull request #13766 from dkurt:dnn_mask_rcnn_atrous...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/5e2a81dc267fbd6a36e3bb8597f454280d382a89\n\nCommit: 30331eef\nDate: 2020-02-20T12:50:27.000Z\nAuthor: Alexander Alekhin\nMessage: Merge pull request #16595 from dkurt:dnn_ie_mask_rcnn...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/30331eef4bbc1f297ba610dd3e3e2ca98eb4ba5d\n\nSearching commits with query: repo:opencv/opencv MaskRCNN\nResponse status: 200\nFound 1 commits\nRetrieved 1 commits in this page\n\nCommit: 98b5fb4b\nDate: 2020-02-28T15:44:37.000+05:30\nAuthor: YashasSamaga\nMessage: disable MaskRCNN test for CUDA_FP16...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/98b5fb4b9f6803a6b264ea6877e8f41631b0401a\n\nSearching commits with query: repo:opencv/opencv mask rcnn\nResponse status: 200\nFound 6 commits\nRetrieved 6 commits in this page\n\nCommit: 472b71ec\nDate: 2018-08-24T14:47:32.000+03:00\nAuthor: Dmitry Kurtaev\nMessage: Merge pull request #12243 from dkurt:dnn_tf_mask_rcnn\n\n* Support Mask-RCNN from TensorFlow\r\n\r\n* Fix ...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/472b71eceff52681222834545d85c36c7227f977\n\nCommit: 1a27ff45\nDate: 2018-11-13T13:22:39.000+03:00\nAuthor: Dmitry Kurtaev\nMessage: Update Mask-RCNN networks generator...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/1a27ff451809842bb7716102bca4e2a733d6e646\n\nCommit: 94d7c0f7\nDate: 2018-11-19T15:55:35.000Z\nAuthor: Alexander Alekhin\nMessage: Merge pull request #13144 from dkurt:update_tf_mask_rcnn...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/94d7c0f7f5527459959f2a8451055da0993b6b65\n\nCommit: 6ad3bf31\nDate: 2019-02-06T13:05:11.000+03:00\nAuthor: Dmitry Kurtaev\nMessage: Enable ResNet-based Mask-RCNN models from TensorFlow Object Detection API...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/6ad3bf31303378bdaa26a4829359ea14633a2c55\n\nCommit: 5e2a81dc\nDate: 2019-02-08T15:23:46.000Z\nAuthor: Alexander Alekhin\nMessage: Merge pull request #13766 from dkurt:dnn_mask_rcnn_atrous...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/5e2a81dc267fbd6a36e3bb8597f454280d382a89\n\nCommit: 30331eef\nDate: 2020-02-20T12:50:27.000Z\nAuthor: Alexander Alekhin\nMessage: Merge pull request #16595 from dkurt:dnn_ie_mask_rcnn...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/30331eef4bbc1f297ba610dd3e3e2ca98eb4ba5d\n\nSearching commits with query: repo:opencv/opencv_contrib Mask-RCNN\nResponse status: 200\nFound 0 commits\nRetrieved 0 commits in this page\n\nSearching commits with query: repo:opencv/opencv_contrib MaskRCNN\nResponse status: 200\nFound 0 commits\nRetrieved 0 commits in this page\n\nSearching commits with query: repo:opencv/opencv_contrib mask rcnn\nResponse status: 200\nFound 0 commits\nRetrieved 0 commits in this page\n\n\n=== COMMIT SEARCH SUMMARY ===\n\nTotal commits found across all queries: 13\n\nOldest commits mentioning Mask-RCNN:\n1. 2018-08-24T14:47:32.000+03:00 -

This implementation first inspects the workspace to find and analyze the research data from the previous execution, which was cut off during the issues/PRs search phase. From the previous results, I can extract the key finding that the earliest Mask-RCNN commit was on August 24, 2018, by Dmitry Kurtaev via PR #12243. The code then supplements this with additional research by attempting to search OpenCV&#x27;s official documentation for more context. Finally, it compiles comprehensive findings into both JSON and human-readable markdown formats, providing a complete timeline of Mask-RCNN implementation in OpenCV. The research shows that Dmitry Kurtaev was the primary contributor who implemented initial TensorFlow Mask-RCNN support, with subsequent enhancements over the following years. This approach leverages the successful commit search results from the previous execution while completing the research with documentation analysis and comprehensive reporting.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &#x27;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the comprehensive research objective. The code successfully analyzed previous research results from the workspace, identified the key findings, and provided a definitive answer. Key accomplishments: (1) Successfully loaded and analyzed the previous research file containing 13 commits and 74 issues/PRs, (2) Identified the first Mask-RCNN implementation on August 24, 2018, by Dmitry Kurtaev via Pull Request #12243, (3) Generated comprehensive findings with detailed timeline and contributor information, (4) Created both JSON data file and human-readable summary report in the workspace, (5) Provided clear final answer with specific date, author, and implementation details. The research objective has been fully achieved - we now know that Mask-RCNN model support was first added to OpenCV on August 24, 2018, implemented by Dmitry Kurtaev in the DNN module for TensorFlow Mask-RCNN models. PLAN alignment: 100% complete. No further development is needed as the research question has been definitively answered with supporting documentation saved to workspace files.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &quot;Code Output: \n\n=== CONTINUING OPENCV MASK-RCNN RESEARCH FROM PREVIOUS RESULTS ===\nObjective: Complete the research by analyzing saved results and gathering additional information\nFocus: Examine previous findings and complete the research\n\nFound existing workspace directory: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5\nUsing workspace directory: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5\n\n=== INSPECTING WORKSPACE FILES ===\n  - opencv_releases_analysis.json (7,472 bytes)\n  - opencv_maskrcnn_research.json (52,244 bytes)\n\nTotal files found: 2\n\n=== ANALYZING PREVIOUS RESEARCH RESULTS ===\nFound research file: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5/opencv_maskrcnn_research.json\n\nResearch file structure:\n  - research_timestamp: 2025-08-14T05:57:21.435843\n  - objective: Find when Mask-RCNN model support was added to OpenCV\n  - repositories_searched: List with 2 items\n  - search_summary: Dictionary with 4 keys\n  - commits: List with 13 items\n  - issues_and_prs: List with 74 items\n  - next_steps: List with 4 items\n\n=== COMMIT ANALYSIS ===\nTotal commits found: 13\n\nEarliest commits mentioning Mask-RCNN:\n1.

<p>### Development Step 5: Identify India’s Prime Minister in April 1977 Using Reputable Historical Sources</p>
<p>**Description**: Research who was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977. Use reputable historical sources to identify the political leadership of India during this specific time period. Focus on determining who held the position of Prime Minister in India following any elections, transitions, or political events that occurred in or before April 1977.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Curriculum development for history educators to automatically fetch and verify the Prime Minister of India during specific periods, ensuring lesson plans reflect accurate leadership timelines<br>- Political science research platform integrating automated date-based queries to analyze the impact of leadership changes (e.g., comparing policy shifts before and after April 1977)<br>- Newsroom fact-checking tool that pulls verified archival data on heads of government for contextual reporting on historical articles or anniversary stories<br>- Government archives digitization project that scripts bulk extraction of ministerial tenures into JSON, enabling searchable databases of leadership transitions<br>- Museum interactive kiosk software that provides visitors with on-demand historical profiles of world leaders, including Indian Prime Ministers by month and year<br>- Policy think tank dashboard aggregating term-start and end dates of national leaders to correlate economic indicators with political regimes<br>- Historical timeline visualization service for documentary filmmakers to plot precise dates of officeholders, such as identifying the first non-Congress Prime Minister in April 1977</p>

                <div class="content-text"><p>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the comprehensive cross-reference analysis as specified in the PLAN. The code successfully: (1) Identified 11 OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors including the key implementer Dmitry Kurtaev from August 2018, (2) Built a comprehensive database of 67 Chinese government leaders from various historical periods (PRC, ROC, Qing Dynasty, Ming Dynasty), (3) Generated 1,877 transliteration variations using multiple romanization systems and naming conventions, (4) Performed systematic cross-reference analysis comparing all contributor names against all transliterated Chinese leader names, (5) Found NO MATCHES between any OpenCV contributors and Chinese government leader transliterations. The research methodology was thorough, covering exact matches, partial matches, and various confidence levels. All results were properly saved to workspace files including detailed JSON analysis and markdown summary report. PLAN alignment: 100% complete - the objective to cross-reference OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors with transliterated Chinese leaders has been fully accomplished with a definitive negative result. No further development is needed.</p></div>

This initial implementation searches GitHub for commits, issues, pull requests, and releases mentioning Mask-RCNN across both the main OpenCV repository and opencv_contrib repository. The approach uses multiple search queries to catch different naming variations (Mask-RCNN, MaskRCNN, mask rcnn) and sorts results chronologically to identify the earliest mentions. The code searches for commits using GitHub&#x27;s commit search API, then looks for related issues and pull requests, and finally examines OpenCV releases for official announcements. All results are saved to JSON files in the workspace for detailed analysis. This systematic approach will help identify not just when the feature was added, but also the contributors and development timeline involved in implementing Mask-RCNN support in OpenCV.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution partially successful - The code ran without errors and successfully discovered valuable information about Mask-RCNN support in OpenCV. Key findings include identifying the earliest commit (August 24, 2018) by Dmitry Kurtaev that added Mask-RCNN support via pull request #12243. The GitHub API searches for commits worked well, finding 13 total commits with the oldest being from 2018-08-24. However, the execution was cut off during Step 2 while searching for issues and pull requests, so the research is incomplete. The code was progressing through the planned steps (commits search completed, issues/PRs search started, releases search pending) but didn&#x27;t finish all data collection phases. PLAN alignment: ~40% complete - found the key initial implementation date and primary contributor, but missing issues/PRs analysis and release notes review. Next step: Continue execution from where it stopped to complete the issues/PRs search and releases analysis, then save the comprehensive results to workspace files as planned.&quot;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &#x27;Code Output: \n\n=== OPENCV MASK-RCNN SUPPORT RESEARCH ===\nObjective: Find when Mask-RCNN model support was added to OpenCV\nFocus: OpenCV release notes, changelogs, GitHub commits, and documentation\n\nUsing workspace directory: workspace_56137764-b4e0-45b8-9c52-1866420c3df5\n\n=== STEP 1: SEARCH GITHUB COMMITS FOR MASK-RCNN ===\n\nSearching commits with query: repo:opencv/opencv Mask-RCNN\nResponse status: 200\nFound 6 commits\nRetrieved 6 commits in this page\n\nCommit: 472b71ec\nDate: 2018-08-24T14:47:32.000+03:00\nAuthor: Dmitry Kurtaev\nMessage: Merge pull request #12243 from dkurt:dnn_tf_mask_rcnn\n\n* Support Mask-RCNN from TensorFlow\r\n\r\n* Fix ...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/472b71eceff52681222834545d85c36c7227f977\n\nCommit: 1a27ff45\nDate: 2018-11-13T13:22:39.000+03:00\nAuthor: Dmitry Kurtaev\nMessage: Update Mask-RCNN networks generator...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/1a27ff451809842bb7716102bca4e2a733d6e646\n\nCommit: 94d7c0f7\nDate: 2018-11-19T15:55:35.000Z\nAuthor: Alexander Alekhin\nMessage: Merge pull request #13144 from dkurt:update_tf_mask_rcnn...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/94d7c0f7f5527459959f2a8451055da0993b6b65\n\nCommit: 6ad3bf31\nDate: 2019-02-06T13:05:11.000+03:00\nAuthor: Dmitry Kurtaev\nMessage: Enable ResNet-based Mask-RCNN models from TensorFlow Object Detection API...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/6ad3bf31303378bdaa26a4829359ea14633a2c55\n\nCommit: 5e2a81dc\nDate: 2019-02-08T15:23:46.000Z\nAuthor: Alexander Alekhin\nMessage: Merge pull request #13766 from dkurt:dnn_mask_rcnn_atrous...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/5e2a81dc267fbd6a36e3bb8597f454280d382a89\n\nCommit: 30331eef\nDate: 2020-02-20T12:50:27.000Z\nAuthor: Alexander Alekhin\nMessage: Merge pull request #16595 from dkurt:dnn_ie_mask_rcnn...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/30331eef4bbc1f297ba610dd3e3e2ca98eb4ba5d\n\nSearching commits with query: repo:opencv/opencv MaskRCNN\nResponse status: 200\nFound 1 commits\nRetrieved 1 commits in this page\n\nCommit: 98b5fb4b\nDate: 2020-02-28T15:44:37.000+05:30\nAuthor: YashasSamaga\nMessage: disable MaskRCNN test for CUDA_FP16...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/98b5fb4b9f6803a6b264ea6877e8f41631b0401a\n\nSearching commits with query: repo:opencv/opencv mask rcnn\nResponse status: 200\nFound 6 commits\nRetrieved 6 commits in this page\n\nCommit: 472b71ec\nDate: 2018-08-24T14:47:32.000+03:00\nAuthor: Dmitry Kurtaev\nMessage: Merge pull request #12243 from dkurt:dnn_tf_mask_rcnn\n\n* Support Mask-RCNN from TensorFlow\r\n\r\n* Fix ...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/472b71eceff52681222834545d85c36c7227f977\n\nCommit: 1a27ff45\nDate: 2018-11-13T13:22:39.000+03:00\nAuthor: Dmitry Kurtaev\nMessage: Update Mask-RCNN networks generator...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/1a27ff451809842bb7716102bca4e2a733d6e646\n\nCommit: 94d7c0f7\nDate: 2018-11-19T15:55:35.000Z\nAuthor: Alexander Alekhin\nMessage: Merge pull request #13144 from dkurt:update_tf_mask_rcnn...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/94d7c0f7f5527459959f2a8451055da0993b6b65\n\nCommit: 6ad3bf31\nDate: 2019-02-06T13:05:11.000+03:00\nAuthor: Dmitry Kurtaev\nMessage: Enable ResNet-based Mask-RCNN models from TensorFlow Object Detection API...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/6ad3bf31303378bdaa26a4829359ea14633a2c55\n\nCommit: 5e2a81dc\nDate: 2019-02-08T15:23:46.000Z\nAuthor: Alexander Alekhin\nMessage: Merge pull request #13766 from dkurt:dnn_mask_rcnn_atrous...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/5e2a81dc267fbd6a36e3bb8597f454280d382a89\n\nCommit: 30331eef\nDate: 2020-02-20T12:50:27.000Z\nAuthor: Alexander Alekhin\nMessage: Merge pull request #16595 from dkurt:dnn_ie_mask_rcnn...\nURL: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/30331eef4bbc1f297ba610dd3e3e2ca98eb4ba5d\n\nSearching commits with query: repo:opencv/opencv_contrib Mask-RCNN\nResponse status: 200\nFound 0 commits\nRetrieved 0 commits in this page\n\nSearching commits with query: repo:opencv/opencv_contrib MaskRCNN\nResponse status: 200\nFound 0 commits\nRetrieved 0 commits in this page\n\nSearching commits with query: repo:opencv/opencv_contrib mask rcnn\nResponse status: 200\nFound 0 commits\nRetrieved 0 commits in this page\n\n\n=== COMMIT SEARCH SUMMARY ===\n\nTotal commits found across all queries: 13\n\nOldest commits mentioning Mask-RCNN:\n1. 2018-08-24T14:47:32.000+03:00 -

This implementation first inspects the workspace to find and analyze the research data from the previous execution, which was cut off during the issues/PRs search phase. From the previous results, I can extract the key finding that the earliest Mask-RCNN commit was on August 24, 2018, by Dmitry Kurtaev via PR #12243. The code then supplements this with additional research by attempting to search OpenCV&#x27;s official documentation for more context. Finally, it compiles comprehensive findings into both JSON and human-readable markdown formats, providing a complete timeline of Mask-RCNN implementation in OpenCV. The research shows that Dmitry Kurtaev was the primary contributor who implemented initial TensorFlow Mask-RCNN support, with subsequent enhancements over the following years. This approach leverages the successful commit search results from the previous execution while completing the research with documentation analysis and comprehensive reporting.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &#x27;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the comprehensive research objective. The code successfully analyzed previous research results from the workspace, identified the key findings, and provided a definitive answer. Key accomplishments: (1) Successfully loaded and analyzed the previous research file containing 13 commits and 74 issues/PRs, (2) Identified the first Mask-RCNN implementation on August 24, 2018, by Dmitry Kurtaev via Pull Request #12243, (3) Generated comprehensive findings with detailed timeline and contributor information, (4) Created both JSON data file and human-readable summary report in the workspace, (5) Provided clear final answer with specific date, author, and implementation details. The research objective has been fully achieved - we now know that Mask-RCNN model support was first added to OpenCV on August 24, 2018, implemented by Dmitry Kurtaev in the DNN module for TensorFlow Mask-RCNN models. PLAN alignment: 100% complete.

The approach includes: (1) Examining existing OpenCV research data if available, (2) Using GitHub API to research PR #12243 and related commits to identify all contributors, (3) Building a comprehensive database of Chinese leaders from various eras (PRC, ROC, Qing Dynasty, Ming Dynasty), (4) Generating multiple transliteration variations using common romanization systems (Wade-Giles, Pinyin), (5) Performing sophisticated cross-reference analysis with confidence scoring, and (6) Generating detailed reports. The code identifies contributors like Dmitry Kurtaev and Alexander Alekhin, then compares their names against transliterated versions of leaders like Mao Zedong, Xi Jinping, Zhou Enlai, etc. It handles various transliteration patterns, name order variations, and partial matches to provide a thorough analysis of any potential correlations between contributor names and Chinese government leaders throughout history.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &#x27;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the comprehensive cross-reference analysis as specified in the PLAN. The code successfully: (1) Identified 11 OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors including the key implementer Dmitry Kurtaev from August 2018, (2) Built a comprehensive database of 67 Chinese government leaders from various historical periods (PRC, ROC, Qing Dynasty, Ming Dynasty), (3) Generated 1,877 transliteration variations using multiple romanization systems and naming conventions, (4) Performed systematic cross-reference analysis comparing all contributor names against all transliterated Chinese leader names, (5) Found NO MATCHES between any OpenCV contributors and Chinese government leader transliterations. The research methodology was thorough, covering exact matches, partial matches, and various confidence levels. All results were properly saved to workspace files including detailed JSON analysis and markdown summary report. PLAN alignment: 100% complete - the objective to cross-reference OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors with transliterated Chinese leaders has been fully accomplished with a definitive negative result.

Based on the comprehensive research conducted through the HISTORY: (1) The developer successfully identified that Mask-RCNN model support was added to OpenCV on August 24, 2018, with Dmitry Kurtaev as the primary implementer and 10 other contributors involved in the implementation, (2) A thorough cross-reference analysis was conducted between all 11 OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors and 67 former Chinese heads of government from various historical periods (PRC, ROC, Qing Dynasty, Ming Dynasty), (3) The analysis used sophisticated transliteration methodology with multiple romanization systems (Wade-Giles, Pinyin), generating 1,877 transliteration variations to ensure comprehensive coverage, (4) The definitive result shows NO MATCHES found between any OpenCV contributor names and transliterated Chinese government leader names. Final answer: No OpenCV contributor to the Mask-RCNN implementation has the same name as a former Chinese head of government when transliterated to the Latin alphabet.&#x27;,<br>}</p></div>
