## Final Answer
```
fluffy
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the specific word quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for dragon depictions in Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article published in a journal named after one of Hreidmar's sons. All members correctly identified: (1) Fafnir as Hreidmar's dragon son who guarded his house, (2) Fafnir Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research as the target journal, (3) Emily Midkiff's article 'Dragons are Tricksy: The Uncanny Dragons of Children's Literature' from June 2014. Individual evaluation: Member 1 provided comprehensive analysis with clear evidence extraction, identifying the key passage: 'Ruth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly cuddly, "fluffy" nature of dragons in children's literature.' Member 2 conducted thorough research with systematic PDF analysis, confirming the same finding with detailed verification. Member 3 initially suggested 'BEMOANED' but this represents the author's description of the scholars' actions, not the actual quoted word expressing their distaste. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on 'fluffy' as the specific word in quotation marks that both authors used to criticize dragon depictions. The evidence shows 'fluffy' appears in quotation marks, indicating direct quotation, while 'bemoaned' is Midkiff's paraphrasing of their critical stance. Synthesis validation: The task specifically asks for the word 'quoted from two different authors' - 'fluffy' meets this criterion as it appears in quotation marks representing the actual language both scholars used, whereas 'bemoaned' is the article author's characterization of their criticism. Final verification confirms 'fluffy' as the precise word both Ruth Stein and Margaret Blount used to express their distaste for the softened portrayal of dragons in children's literature.
