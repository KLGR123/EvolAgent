### City Where Homeless Shelter Conversion to Flats Was Approved in October 2019

**TASK**: "In October 2019, a developer received planning permission to convert a homeless shelter into flats in a city. This developer had developed a building located in an area along the Bournemouth Seafront, which includes the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum and the East Cliff Lift, contains historic villas from the 19th Century, and was designated as a conservation area in 1987. What is the name of this city?"

### First name of the firm that designed the Chicago landmark named for APOD horizon city namesake

**TASK**: During the first week of August 2015, one of the NASA Astronomy Pictures of the Day shows the lights of a city on the horizon.

    "description": "After comprehensive analysis of the HISTORY and multiple search attempts, I must conclude that the specific evidence sought by the PLAN - documentation of Heathrow Airport's energy harvesting infrastructure proposals that were non-shortlisted by assessment authorities - cannot be located through publicly accessible web search methods.\n\nKey findings from the extensive search efforts:\n\n1. **Search Scope Completed**: Multiple comprehensive search strategies were executed including:\n   - 120+ search results from initial expansion searches\n   - Government archive searches targeting .gov.uk, planninginspectorate.gov.uk, parliament.uk\n   - Academic database searches via ResearchGate, Academia.edu\n   - News archive searches for historical documentation\n   - Ultra-targeted searches using specific terminology combinations\n\n2. **Evidence Located**: The searches successfully confirmed:\n   - July 2013: Heathrow submitted three expansion proposals to the Airports Commission\n   - Assessment Authority: Davies Commission/Airports Commission (2012-2015)\n   - Energy harvesting technology discussions occurred during this period\n   - 19 results contained Airports Commission references\n   - Historical documentation exists for the relevant timeframe\n\n3. **Missing Critical Evidence**: Despite exhaustive searching, no results were found containing:\n   - Direct connection between energy harvesting infrastructure proposals and non-shortlisted outcomes\n   - Specific evidence of energy harvesting proposals being rejected or unsuccessful\n   - Critical combinations of energy harvesting + negative assessment outcomes\n\n4. **Technical Issues Resolved**: The persistent NameError with 'combined_text' variable scoping was identified and addressed in the final analysis, allowing successful processing of search data.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The specific historical information sought by the PLAN appears to be contained in:\n   - Confidential assessment reports not publicly accessible\n   - Restricted government archives requiring Freedom of Information requests\n   - Internal planning authority records not published online\n   - Documents that may be commercially or politically sensitive\n\n**PLAN Requirements Assessment**:\n- ✅ Submission timing identified: July 2013 to Airports Commission\n- ✅ Assessment authority identified: Davies Commission/Airports Commission  \n- ✅ Energy harvesting technology confirmed as discussed during relevant period\n- ❌ Specific evidence of non-shortlisted energy harvesting proposals: NOT FOUND\n\nThe comprehensive search approach has been exhaustively executed across government, academic, and news sources. The PLAN requirements are 75% met, but the critical evidence of non-shortlisted outcomes for energy harvesting infrastructure proposals is not accessible through public web search methods. Further research would require formal Freedom of Information Act requests or direct access to confidential government assessment archives.",

    "description": "TASK COMPLETED: Comprehensive investigation of London City Airport energy harvesting proposals has been successfully completed. Key findings: (1) London City Airport has confirmed energy infrastructure projects including an active microgrid development with solar PV and Combined Heat & Power (CHP) systems as part of the £630 million City Airport Development Programme, (2) Planning applications were initially rejected by Newham Council in July 2023 but later approved by government on appeal in August 2024, (3) No evidence found of specific 'energy harvesting tiles' proposals that were non-shortlisted, (4) The airport has approved and active energy projects rather than rejected energy harvesting proposals. CONCLUSION: London City Airport is NOT the correct airport for the original hypothesis about non-shortlisted energy harvesting infrastructure proposals. The comprehensive analysis has been saved to 'workspace/london_city_airport_comprehensive_search_summary.txt' containing detailed findings that definitively rule out this airport. The investigation successfully determined that London City Airport does not match the criteria specified in the PLAN - it has approved energy infrastructure rather than rejected energy harvesting tiles proposals.
