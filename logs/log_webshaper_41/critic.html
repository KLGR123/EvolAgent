                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                No such airport exists that meets both criteria<br><br>
                <strong>True Answer:</strong><br>
                July 2013<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task analysis: Identify a London international airport that (1) features energy harvesting floor tiles, (2) submitted expansion proposals including energy harvesting infrastructure, (3) had proposals assessed by an authority, and (4) received non-shortlisted status with specific month/year timing. Comprehensive evaluation of team solutions: Member 1 conducted systematic analysis of multiple London airports including Heathrow, Thames Estuary Airport, London City Airport, Stansted, and Luton, processing hundreds of search results but found no airport meeting all criteria simultaneously. Member 2 executed parallel comprehensive research covering Stansted, Luton, and smaller regional airports, analyzing 164+ results per airport with similar negative findings. Member 3 focused on Gatwick and Luton expansion proposals, confirming both had non-shortlisted DCO applications (Gatwick July 2023, Luton February 2023) but found no energy harvesting floor tiles at these locations. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence: All members independently confirmed (1) Heathrow Airport has Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles in Terminal 3 but no evidence of non-shortlisted expansion proposals including energy harvesting infrastructure, (2) Gatwick and Luton had expansion proposals rejected/non-shortlisted by Planning Inspectorate but no energy harvesting floor tiles installations, (3) Other London airports (City, Stansted, Southend, Oxford) showed no evidence of either component. Synthesis evaluation: Despite processing 500+ search results across official Planning Inspectorate documents, government records, and aviation industry sources, no single London international airport was found possessing both energy harvesting floor tiles AND non-shortlisted expansion proposals. The required combination appears to not exist in publicly accessible records. All three members reached identical conclusions through different methodological approaches, providing high confidence in the negative finding.
