## Task Description
```
I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.

### City where Kuznetzov’s Vietnamese specimens in Nedoshivina’s 2010 paper were deposited

**TASK**: Where were the Vietnamese specimens described by Kuznetzov in Nedoshivina's 2010 paper eventually deposited? Just give me the city name without abbreviations.

```

    "plan": "Search for Nedoshivina's 2010 scientific paper that includes descriptions of Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov. Focus on finding the complete publication with methods/materials sections or specimen repository information. Use these search approaches: (1) Academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or ResearchGate using keywords 'Nedoshivina 2010 Vietnamese specimens Kuznetzov', (2) Taxonomic databases that might reference specimen deposits, (3) Journal archives that published the paper in 2010. Look specifically for sections mentioning specimen deposition, museum collections, or institutional repositories where the Vietnamese materials were stored.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to locate the specific 2010 paper by Nedoshivina that mentions Kuznetzov's Vietnamese specimens, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the publication and identify specimen repository information, (4) This directly targets finding the deposition location mentioned in the paper",

### Absolute Difference in Tens of Thousands Between 2018 and 2020 Chinstrap Penguin Populations

**TASK**: What is the absolute difference in tens of thousands between the population of chinstrap penguins on the Wikipedia page for penguin species populations as of the end of 2018 and the population recorded in the Nature.com "global population assessment of the Chinstrap penguin" article from 2020, assuming two penguins per breeding pair?

The PLAN required searching for and accessing Wikipedia pages about penguin species populations to locate specific chinstrap penguin population data as of the end of 2018, extract the population figure with measurement type clarification, and document the exact source and context.\n\nCOMPLETE RESULTS ACHIEVED:\n\n**Population Figure Found**: 8 million specimens (individual penguins, not breeding pairs)\n\n**Source**: IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), 2018\n\n**Exact Quote**: "In 2018, the IUCN estimated that the population of chinstrap penguins was around 8 million specimens."\n\n**Source Context**: \n- Wikipedia page: "Chinstrap penguin" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinstrap_penguin)\n- Section: Conservation status\n- Full context: The quote continues to note that while the population is believed to be decreasing overall, it\'s not severely fragmented and is increasing or stable in many sites. The species is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List.\n\n**Measurement Type Confirmation**: The data explicitly states "specimens" indicating individual penguins rather than breeding pairs, which directly addresses the PLAN requirement to note whether the figure represents breeding pairs or individual penguins.\n\n**Research Process Summary**:\n1. Conducted systematic Google searches targeting Wikipedia pages with chinstrap penguin population data\n2. Identified 39 total search results across 4 targeted queries\n3. Located the primary Wikipedia page "Chinstrap penguin" containing the target information\n4. Fetched and parsed the HTML content using multiple extraction methods\n5. Applied regex pattern matching to isolate the specific 2018 IUCN population statement\n6. Verified the data through conservation status section analysis\n7. Compiled comprehensive documentation with full source attribution\n\n**Files Created**:\n- workspace/chinstrap_penguin_search_results.json (search data)\n- workspace/chinstrap_penguin_population_extraction.json (extraction results)\n- workspace/chinstrap_penguin_final_answer.json (complete final answer)\n- workspace/chinstrap_penguin.html (source Wikipedia page)\n- workspace/list_of_sphenisciformes_by_population.html (supporting page)\n\n**Confidence Level**: High - The information was extracted from an authoritative source (IUCN via Wikipedia) with clear 2018 attribution, specific numerical data, and explicit measurement type clarification.

The code successfully executed without errors and extracted the required clownfish occurrence data from USGS NAS database files. (2) Approach selection reasoning: The ultra-simple test approach worked perfectly by processing one file at a time with proper variable scoping, successfully extracting concrete data including Florida as location and 2018 as pre-2020 date from official USGS documentation. (3) How this advances the plan: This completes the entire PLAN objective by successfully identifying clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris) as Finding Nemo's main character species and locating official USGS data documenting it as a nonnative species with specific location (Florida) and temporal data (2018) before 2020. (4) Relationship to previous iterations and HISTORY feedback: The final iteration successfully resolved the persistent variable scope issue through the ultra-simple approach, building on all previous work including species identification, USGS database access, and HTML file downloads to achieve complete success. (5) File paths created in workspace/: Successfully created 'workspace/final_extraction_debug.txt' with debug information and 'workspace/clownfish_simple_test_results.json' containing the complete successful results. The PLAN objective is fully achieved with concrete findings: clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris) identified as Finding Nemo's main character species, official USGS NAS database documentation located (Species ID 3243), and specific nonnative occurrence data extracted showing clownfish documented in Florida in 2018 before 2020.
