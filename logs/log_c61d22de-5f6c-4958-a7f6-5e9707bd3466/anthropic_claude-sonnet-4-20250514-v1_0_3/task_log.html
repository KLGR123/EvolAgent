<p>Episodic Examples:<br>### Estimating Number of False-Positive Nature 2020 Papers with Mean p-Value of 0.04</p>
<p>**TASK**: If we assume all articles published by Nature in 2020 (articles, only, not book reviews/columns, etc) relied on statistical significance to justify their findings and they on average came to a p-value of 0.04, how many papers would be incorrect as to their claims of statistical significance?

Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the baseline number of Nature research articles from 2020 to calculate how many would be statistically incorrect, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the total count of research articles published by Nature in 2020, (4) This provides the foundation for applying the statistical significance error rate calculation based on the given p-value of 0.04&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - The PLAN has been fully executed and the definitive answer has been found. Through systematic analysis of Nature journal&#x27;s official 2020 research articles archive (https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?type=article&amp;year=2020), I successfully determined that Nature journal published 1,002 research articles in 2020. \n\nKEY FINDINGS:\n• Final Answer: 1,002 research articles published by Nature journal in 2020\n• Source: Official Nature journal archive with type=article filter\n• Verification: Pattern &#x27;Article (1002)&#x27; found 4 times in the archive content\n• Content Type: Peer-reviewed research articles only (excludes editorials, book reviews, columns, correspondence, and other non-research content as specified in the PLAN)\n• Confidence Level: High (direct extraction from authoritative source)\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n1. Accessed Nature journal&#x27;s official 2020 research articles archive\n2. Downloaded and analyzed archive content from multiple Nature journal pages\n3. Performed pattern matching to identify article count indicators\n4. Verified filters confirmed research articles only (type=article parameter)\n5. Cross-referenced findings across multiple archive files\n6. Documented comprehensive evidence and verification details\n\nOUTPUT FILES CREATED:\n• FINAL_ANSWER_Nature_2020_Research_Articles.json - Complete documentation with source verification, methodology, and confidence assessment\n• Multiple archive analysis files with detailed content extraction\n• Comprehensive verification of filter indicators and content types\n\nThe PLAN requirement to &#x27;focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing&#x27; has been satisfied through the type=article filter confirmation, which specifically excludes editorials, book reviews, columns, and other non-research content. The answer of 1,002 research articles is definitive and well-documented with high confidence from the official Nature journal source.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &quot;Calculate the number of statistically incorrect papers using the false positive rate principle. Given that Nature published 1,002 research articles in 2020, all assumed to rely on statistical significance with an average p-value of 0.04, determine how many would be incorrectly claiming statistical significance. Apply the concept that a p-value of 0.04 means there&#x27;s a 4% chance of a false positive (Type I error) when the null hypothesis is true. Calculate 1,002 × 0.04 and round up to the next integer as specified in the TASK.&quot;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have established that Nature published 1,002 research articles in 2020 from the previous research, (2) The TASK provides the statistical parameters (p-value of 0.04) and assumption that all articles relied on statistical significance, (3) Expected outcome is to apply the false positive rate calculation to determine how many papers would be statistically incorrect, (4) This completes the TASK by calculating the final answer with proper rounding as requested&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;Task completed successfully. The statistical calculation has been performed correctly according to the PLAN requirements. The code calculated that out of 1,002 Nature research articles from 2020 with an average p-value of 0.04, exactly 41 papers would be statistically incorrect due to false positive (Type I error) rates. The calculation used the formula: 1,002 × 0.04 = 40.08, which was properly rounded up to 41 using math.ceil() as specified. The tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with no errors and verified that all objectives were achieved including: (1) mathematical calculation performed correctly, (2) statistical concept explanation provided, (3) proper rounding methodology applied, and (4) comprehensive results saved to workspace/statistical_calculation_results.json. The final answer of 41 papers is mathematically sound and represents the expected number of studies that would incorrectly claim statistical significance when the null hypothesis is actually true, based on the false positive rate principle.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive analysis conducted: (1) Nature journal published 1,002 research articles in 2020 (verified from official Nature archive), (2) Given the assumption that all articles relied on statistical significance with an average p-value of 0.04, (3) Applied the false positive rate calculation: 1,002 × 0.04 = 40.08, (4) Rounded up to the next integer as specified: 41.

<p>### Development Step 2: Identify Year David Sklar Introduced Innovation Reports Section in Academic Medicine Journal</p>
<p>**Description**: Search for information about David Sklar and Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine journal. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Direct search for &#x27;David Sklar Innovation Reports Academic Medicine journal&#x27;, (2) Search Academic Medicine journal archives or database for articles by David Sklar, (3) Search for &#x27;Innovation Reports Academic Medicine introduction year&#x27;, (4) Look for historical information about when Innovation Reports section was established in Academic Medicine. Focus on identifying the specific year when David Sklar introduced or established the Innovation Reports feature in this medical journal.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Competitive intelligence for product teams: parse search engine results and press release archives to pinpoint the exact year a rival company introduced a flagship feature, enabling data-driven roadmap planning.<br>- Academic editorial research: mine online journal archives and search metadata to determine when a specific section (e.g., “Case Studies”) was first established and credit the founding editor with publication details.<br>- Legal compliance tracking: analyze government websites and legal databases to extract the enactment year of a new regulation by detecting keywords like “enacted” or “established” in legal snippets.<br>- Patent analytics for R&amp;D: aggregate patent office search results and automatically extract filing and grant years for key inventions in a target technology domain, ranking them by relevance.<br>- Marketing campaign monitoring: search news aggregators and corporate blogs to identify the introduction date of a major brand slogan or sustainability initiative, capturing launch year and source URLs.<br>- Public policy timeline building: scrape WHO, CDC, and other public health agency archives to confirm the publication year of critical guidelines, filtering for “published” or “launched” mentions in the text.<br>- Technical standards research: gather search results from ISO, IEEE, and industry consortium websites to establish when a new communication protocol or best practice standard was first released.<br>- Corporate heritage documentation: compile internal communications, annual reports, and press coverage to verify the inception year of a company’s flagship community outreach program, extracting evidence and timestamps.</p>

                <div class="content-text"><p>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully downloaded and analyzed 3 priority papers from June 2022. The script downloaded 3 PDFs totaling ~28MB, extracted full text content, and performed comprehensive figure analysis. **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: Paper 1 &#x27;Fairness in Agreement With European Values&#x27; (arXiv:2207.01510) contains exactly what we&#x27;re looking for - Figure 1 shows &#x27;Three identified axes along which the debate about regulation of fairness in AI falls&#x27; with clear axis labels: Standardized/Localized, Egalitarian/Utilitarian, Consequential/Deontological, Subjective/Objective, Hard to deploy/Easy to deploy, and Inclusive/Majoritarian. This appears to be the target figure with three axes containing label words at both ends. PLAN alignment: 90% complete - the specific figure has been located and the text extraction shows the six axis label pairs. Final step needed: Extract and clearly document all six axis label words (two words per axis for three axes total) from the identified Figure 1 context. Recommend saving the detailed analysis results and focusing on confirming the exact three-axis structure and six labels from this promising finding.</p></div>

The script successfully extracted the six axis label words from Figure 1 in paper 2207.01510 &#x27;Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation&#x27; from June 2022. The analysis clearly identified the figure with &#x27;Three identified axes along which the debate about regulation of fairness in AI falls&#x27; and systematically extracted all six axis label words organized into three axes: Axis 1 (Standardized/Localized), Axis 2 (Egalitarian/Utilitarian), and Axis 3 (Consequential/Deontological). The final results were properly saved to &#x27;final_axis_labels_extraction.json&#x27; with complete documentation. PLAN alignment: 100% complete - mission accomplished. The code successfully: (1) Found AI regulation papers from arXiv June 2022, (2) Located the specific figure with three axes containing label words at both ends, (3) Extracted all six axis label words as required. No further development is needed - the objective has been fully achieved.</p></div>

The analysis includes multiple detection methods: direct &#x27;June 2022&#x27; text, &#x27;2022-06&#x27; format, presence of both &#x27;june&#x27; and &#x27;2022&#x27;, and arXiv ID patterns like &#x27;2207&#x27; (July 2022 submissions often submitted in June). Each paper is scored based on relevance indicators and AI regulation keywords in the title. High-priority papers (score ≥5) are flagged for immediate download and analysis.

The script successfully parsed the search results, identified 25 June 2022 papers from 77 total arXiv links, and found 10 high-priority papers with strong June 2022 indicators. Key findings include &#x27;Fairness in Agreement With European Values&#x27; (arXiv:2207.01510) with the highest relevance score of 12, and 9 other priority papers. The analysis results were properly saved to &#x27;june_2022_papers_analysis.json&#x27; (23,550 bytes).

I first inspect the analysis file structure to understand the priority papers data, then download PDFs using proper headers and error handling. For each downloaded paper, I use PyPDFLoader to extract text content and systematically search for figure-related keywords, axis mentions, and three-dimensional patterns. The analysis includes regex searches for figure references and their contexts, looking for axis-related terminology and potential label word patterns like &#x27;low/high&#x27;, &#x27;left/right&#x27;, &#x27;positive/negative&#x27;. Each paper&#x27;s full text is saved for manual inspection, and comprehensive analysis results are stored in JSON format. This approach balances automated text analysis with the ability to manually examine promising contexts to locate the specific figure with three axes and six label words (two per axis).&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully downloaded and analyzed 3 priority papers from June 2022. The script downloaded 3 PDFs totaling ~28MB, extracted full text content, and performed comprehensive figure analysis. **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: Paper 1 &#x27;Fairness in Agreement With European Values&#x27; (arXiv:2207.01510) contains exactly what we&#x27;re looking for - Figure 1 shows &#x27;Three identified axes along which the debate about regulation of fairness in AI falls&#x27; with clear axis labels: Standardized/Localized, Egalitarian/Utilitarian, Consequential/Deontological, Subjective/Objective, Hard to deploy/Easy to deploy, and Inclusive/Majoritarian. This appears to be the target figure with three axes containing label words at both ends. PLAN alignment: 90% complete - the specific figure has been located and the text extraction shows the six axis label pairs. Final step needed: Extract and clearly document all six axis label words (two words per axis for three axes total) from the identified Figure 1 context. Recommend saving the detailed analysis results and focusing on confirming the exact three-axis structure and six labels from this promising finding.&quot;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &quot;Code Output: \n\n=== DOWNLOADING AND ANALYZING TOP JUNE 2022 AI REGULATION PAPERS ===\nObjective: Download priority papers and search for figures with three axes\nFocus: Find figures with label words at both ends of each axis\n\nStep 1: Inspecting analysis file structure...\nAnalysis data keys: [&#x27;analysis_timestamp&#x27;, &#x27;total_arxiv_papers&#x27;, &#x27;june_2022_papers_found&#x27;, &#x27;high_priority_papers&#x27;, &#x27;june_2022_papers&#x27;, &#x27;priority_papers_for_download&#x27;, &#x27;next_steps&#x27;]\nNumber of priority papers: 10\nFirst paper structure: [&#x27;title&#x27;, &#x27;arxiv_id&#x27;, &#x27;pdf_link&#x27;, &#x27;abstract_link&#x27;, &#x27;snippet&#x27;, &#x27;source_query&#x27;, &#x27;june_indicators&#x27;]\n\n=== STEP 2: DOWNLOADING TOP PRIORITY PAPERS ===\n\n--- DOWNLOADING PAPER 1/3 ---\nTitle: (PDF) Fairness in Agreement With European Values\narXiv ID: 2207.01510\nPDF Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01510\nMaking request to download PDF...\nResponse status: 200\nContent type: application/pdf\n✓ PDF downloaded successfully: paper_1_2207_01510.pdf (579,519 bytes)\n✓ Paper added to analysis queue\n\n--- DOWNLOADING PAPER 2/3 ---\nTitle: Contents\narXiv ID: 2207.094601\nPDF Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09460v11.pdf\nMaking request to download PDF...\nResponse status: 200\nContent type: application/pdf\n✓ PDF downloaded successfully: paper_2_2207_094601.pdf (27,694,997 bytes)\n✓ Paper added to analysis queue\n\n--- DOWNLOADING PAPER 3/3 ---\nTitle: global ai governance: where the challenge is the solution - ...\narXiv ID: 2503.04766\nPDF Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04766\nMaking request to download PDF...\nResponse status: 200\nContent type: application/pdf\n✓ PDF downloaded successfully: paper_3_2503_04766.pdf (617,950 bytes)\n✓ Paper added to analysis queue\n\n=== STEP 3: PARSING DOWNLOADED PAPERS FOR FIGURES ===\nSuccessfully downloaded papers: 3\n\n--- ANALYZING PAPER 1: (PDF) Fairness in Agreement With European Values... ---\nFile: workspace_c61d22de-5f6c-4958-a7f6-5e9707bd3466/paper_1_2207_01510.pdf (579,519 bytes)\nExtracting text from PDF...\nPDF successfully parsed: 33 pages\nTotal text length: 88,774 characters\nFigure-related mentions: 13\nAxis-related mentions: 24\nThree-axis mentions: 286\nPotential figure contexts found: 1\n\n*** PROMISING FIGURE CONTEXTS ***\n\nContext 1 - figure 1:\nures\n1Nash social welfare [50] is an exception.\n11\nStandardized\nLocalized\nEgalitarian\nUtilitarian\nConsequential\nDeontological\nSubjective\nHard to deploy\nInclusive\nObjective\nEasy to deploy\nMajoritarian\nFigure 1: Three identiﬁed axes along which the debate about regulation of fairness in AI falls; Here they\nare aligned along high-level characterizations and common arguments made for, and against, each of the\nends of the identiﬁed axes.\n(from Cambridge dictionary), speciﬁcally, through the creation of proto\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*** POTENTIAL AXIS LABEL CONTEXTS ***\n\nLabel Context 1:\nMatch: low risk, high\nContext: mum requirements speciﬁed in the legislation, requirements that become stricter as\nthe risk associated with the system increases (i.e., minimal risk, low risk, high risk, and unacceptable\n6\nrisk).

The script successfully extracted the six axis label words from Figure 1 in paper 2207.01510 &#x27;Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation&#x27; from June 2022. The analysis clearly identified the figure with &#x27;Three identified axes along which the debate about regulation of fairness in AI falls&#x27; and systematically extracted all six axis label words organized into three axes: Axis 1 (Standardized/Localized), Axis 2 (Egalitarian/Utilitarian), and Axis 3 (Consequential/Deontological). The final results were properly saved to &#x27;final_axis_labels_extraction.json&#x27; with complete documentation. PLAN alignment: 100% complete - mission accomplished. The code successfully: (1) Found AI regulation papers from arXiv June 2022, (2) Located the specific figure with three axes containing label words at both ends, (3) Extracted all six axis label words as required. No further development is needed - the objective has been fully achieved.&quot;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &#x27;Code Output: \n\n=== EXTRACTING SIX AXIS LABEL WORDS FROM IDENTIFIED FIGURE ===\nObjective: Extract the six axis label words from Figure 1 in paper 2207.01510\nTarget: Three axes with two label words at each end\n\nStep 1: Loading and inspecting the extracted text file...\nText file size: 88,774 characters\n\nStep 2: Locating Figure 1 with three axes...\nFigure contexts found: 4\n\nStep 3: Extracting axis label words...\n✓ Found the axis labels section!\n\n*** AXIS LABELS CONTEXT ***\nrences between standardization and localization.

<p>Episodic Examples:<br>### Development Step 4: Locate 1851 Atheistic Naturalism Phrenology Mesmerism Book and 2009 Reissuing Publisher</p>
<p>**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify a co-authored book from 1851 that advocated for atheistic naturalism, systematically explored phrenology and mesmerism, was controversial for these topics, and was reissued by a publisher in 2009. Search using keywords including &#x27;1851 book atheistic naturalism phrenology mesmerism co-authored&#x27;, &#x27;1851 controversial book phrenology mesmerism reissued 2009&#x27;, &#x27;atheistic naturalism 1851 publication&#x27;, and &#x27;phrenology mesmerism 1851 authors&#x27;. Focus on identifying both the original 1851 publication details and the specific publisher who reissued it in 2009.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- University research library digitization team using the multi-engine search script to locate and verify obscure 1851 scientific texts for digital archive inclusion and confirm 2009 reissue details.<br>- Historical society librarian employing automated Google Scholar, Bing, JSTOR, and archive.org queries to compile a complete bibliography of co-authored controversial phrenology and mesmerism treatises for a museum exhibition.<br>- Digital humanities scholar mapping the spread of atheistic naturalism by systematically harvesting primary sources and modern reprint information from multiple search engines for network analysis.<br>- Rare bookseller validating a potential 1851 first edition’s provenance by cross-referencing academic databases and general web searches to confirm authorship, publication history, and a 2009 specialty press reissue.<br>- PhD candidate in history of science leveraging the Python multi-method search to uncover mid-19th century philosophical works on phrenology and mesmerism across library catalogs and online archives for dissertation research.<br>- Independent publisher’s research team discovering forgotten public domain texts for annotated reissues by scanning academic sites and search engines to identify obscure co-authored volumes and track modern rights holders.<br>- Data journalist investigating the revival of fringe-science publications by extracting publication metadata and reissue patterns from search logs to illustrate how 19th-century controversial works reappear in contemporary niche markets.</p>

<p>### Development Step 9: Download Westerink’s &quot;A Dark Trace&quot; from Project MUSE and Extract Chapter 2’s Influential Author</p>
<p>**Description**: Access and download the full text of &#x27;A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt&#x27; by H. Westerink from Project MUSE using DOI 10.1353/book.24372. Since the book was confirmed to be open access, retrieve the complete text and save it to workspace/dark_trace_freud_book.pdf or appropriate format. Focus on locating and extracting Chapter 2 content to identify the author who influenced Freud&#x27;s belief in &#x27;endopsychic myths&#x27;. If the full book is not directly downloadable, extract Chapter 2 specifically or access the book&#x27;s table of contents to determine the exact chapter title and content structure.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Legal due diligence in corporate mergers: automatically download open-access regulatory codes in PDF, search for “antitrust” and “competition” term variations, extract and summarize context to identify potential deal blockers.<br>- Pharmaceutical literature review automation: fetch clinical trial protocols via DOI, load full-text PDFs, search for “double-blind” and “placebo” mentions, and extract methodological passages along with author names for evidence synthesis.<br>- Patent portfolio analysis for semiconductor R&amp;D: retrieve patent documents from public repositories, scan PDFs for “heterojunction” and “quantum well” variants, extract inventor citations and contextual explanations to map technology lineage.<br>- Historical philosophy research on Nietzsche and Kant: access digitized editions of 19th-century works, locate references to “categorical imperative” or “will to power,” and extract surrounding paragraphs to trace cross-author influences.<br>- Competitive intelligence from SEC filings: download publicly available 10-K and 10-Q reports, search for “risk factor,” “liquidity risk,” and “market volatility” variations, and pull relevant excerpts for financial analysis dashboards.<br>- Academic curriculum design from open textbooks: ingest complete PDF textbooks via DOIs, locate chapter summaries or “learning objectives” headings, extract and compile structured outlines for course syllabi.<br>- Investigative journalism document mining: import leaked policy PDFs, search for “whistleblower,” “confidential,” and “internal memo” terms, extract context with names and dates to support storytelling.<br>- Compliance monitoring in healthcare: load clinical guideline PDFs, scan for “contraindication,” “adverse effect,” and “off-label” variations, and extract detailed sections with authoring bodies for automated policy updates.</p>

<p>### Development Step 10: Total Peer-Reviewed Research Articles in Nature Journal in 2020</p>
<p>**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Academic library annual reporting: extracting the exact count of peer-reviewed Nature research articles published in 2020 to benchmark institutional subscription usage and justify renewals<br>- University research office trend analysis: automating retrieval of yearly article volumes from top journals to support faculty grant applications and strategic planning<br>- Science policy evaluation: government agencies compiling annual publication counts in high-impact journals like Nature to inform national R&amp;D funding allocations<br>- Bibliometric research automation: data scientists scraping journal archives to gather article counts for large-scale scientometric studies on publication trends<br>- Publisher compliance auditing: open-access officers verifying Nature’s reported yearly research output against funder mandates for public access to peer-reviewed work<br>- Competitive intelligence for scholarly publishers: market analysts comparing annual article volumes across leading journals to refine editorial and acquisition strategies<br>- Systematic review scoping: clinical researchers estimating the universe of Nature research articles in 2020 to determine workload and feasibility of a medical literature review</p>

Key findings include &#x27;Fairness in Agreement With European Values&#x27; (arXiv:2207.01510) with the highest relevance score of 12, and 9 other priority papers.

I first inspect the analysis file structure to understand the priority papers data, then download PDFs using proper headers and error handling. For each downloaded paper, I use PyPDFLoader to extract text content and systematically search for figure-related keywords, axis mentions, and three-dimensional patterns. The analysis includes regex searches for figure references and their contexts, looking for axis-related terminology and potential label word patterns like &#x27;low/high&#x27;, &#x27;left/right&#x27;, &#x27;positive/negative&#x27;. Each paper&#x27;s full text is saved for manual inspection, and comprehensive analysis results are stored in JSON format. This approach balances automated text analysis with the ability to manually examine promising contexts to locate the specific figure with three axes and six label words (two per axis).&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully downloaded and analyzed 3 priority papers from June 2022. The script downloaded 3 PDFs totaling ~28MB, extracted full text content, and performed comprehensive figure analysis. **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: Paper 1 &#x27;Fairness in Agreement With European Values&#x27; (arXiv:2207.01510) contains exactly what we&#x27;re looking for - Figure 1 shows &#x27;Three identified axes along which the debate about regulation of fairness in AI falls&#x27; with clear axis labels: Standardized/Localized, Egalitarian/Utilitarian, Consequential/Deontological, Subjective/Objective, Hard to deploy/Easy to deploy, and Inclusive/Majoritarian. This appears to be the target figure with three axes containing label words at both ends. PLAN alignment: 90% complete - the specific figure has been located and the text extraction shows the six axis label pairs. Final step needed: Extract and clearly document all six axis label words (two words per axis for three axes total) from the identified Figure 1 context. Recommend saving the detailed analysis results and focusing on confirming the exact three-axis structure and six labels from this promising finding.&quot;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &quot;Code Output: \n\n=== DOWNLOADING AND ANALYZING TOP JUNE 2022 AI REGULATION PAPERS ===\nObjective: Download priority papers and search for figures with three axes\nFocus: Find figures with label words at both ends of each axis\n\nStep 1: Inspecting analysis file structure...\nAnalysis data keys: [&#x27;analysis_timestamp&#x27;, &#x27;total_arxiv_papers&#x27;, &#x27;june_2022_papers_found&#x27;, &#x27;high_priority_papers&#x27;, &#x27;june_2022_papers&#x27;, &#x27;priority_papers_for_download&#x27;, &#x27;next_steps&#x27;]\nNumber of priority papers: 10\nFirst paper structure: [&#x27;title&#x27;, &#x27;arxiv_id&#x27;, &#x27;pdf_link&#x27;, &#x27;abstract_link&#x27;, &#x27;snippet&#x27;, &#x27;source_query&#x27;, &#x27;june_indicators&#x27;]\n\n=== STEP 2: DOWNLOADING TOP PRIORITY PAPERS ===\n\n--- DOWNLOADING PAPER 1/3 ---\nTitle: (PDF) Fairness in Agreement With European Values\narXiv ID: 2207.01510\nPDF Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01510\nMaking request to download PDF...\nResponse status: 200\nContent type: application/pdf\n✓ PDF downloaded successfully: paper_1_2207_01510.pdf (579,519 bytes)\n✓ Paper added to analysis queue\n\n--- DOWNLOADING PAPER 2/3 ---\nTitle: Contents\narXiv ID: 2207.094601\nPDF Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09460v11.pdf\nMaking request to download PDF...\nResponse status: 200\nContent type: application/pdf\n✓ PDF downloaded successfully: paper_2_2207_094601.pdf (27,694,997 bytes)\n✓ Paper added to analysis queue\n\n--- DOWNLOADING PAPER 3/3 ---\nTitle: global ai governance: where the challenge is the solution - ...\narXiv ID: 2503.04766\nPDF Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04766\nMaking request to download PDF...\nResponse status: 200\nContent type: application/pdf\n✓ PDF downloaded successfully: paper_3_2503_04766.pdf (617,950 bytes)\n✓ Paper added to analysis queue\n\n=== STEP 3: PARSING DOWNLOADED PAPERS FOR FIGURES ===\nSuccessfully downloaded papers: 3\n\n--- ANALYZING PAPER 1: (PDF) Fairness in Agreement With European Values... ---\nFile: workspace_c61d22de-5f6c-4958-a7f6-5e9707bd3466/paper_1_2207_01510.pdf (579,519 bytes)\nExtracting text from PDF...\nPDF successfully parsed: 33 pages\nTotal text length: 88,774 characters\nFigure-related mentions: 13\nAxis-related mentions: 24\nThree-axis mentions: 286\nPotential figure contexts found: 1\n\n*** PROMISING FIGURE CONTEXTS ***\n\nContext 1 - figure 1:\nures\n1Nash social welfare [50] is an exception.\n11\nStandardized\nLocalized\nEgalitarian\nUtilitarian\nConsequential\nDeontological\nSubjective\nHard to deploy\nInclusive\nObjective\nEasy to deploy\nMajoritarian\nFigure 1: Three identiﬁed axes along which the debate about regulation of fairness in AI falls; Here they\nare aligned along high-level characterizations and common arguments made for, and against, each of the\nends of the identiﬁed axes.\n(from Cambridge dictionary), speciﬁcally, through the creation of proto\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*** POTENTIAL AXIS LABEL CONTEXTS ***\n\nLabel Context 1:\nMatch: low risk, high\nContext: mum requirements speciﬁed in the legislation, requirements that become stricter as\nthe risk associated with the system increases (i.e., minimal risk, low risk, high risk, and unacceptable\n6\nrisk).

The script successfully extracted the six axis label words from Figure 1 in paper 2207.01510 &#x27;Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation&#x27; from June 2022. The analysis clearly identified the figure with &#x27;Three identified axes along which the debate about regulation of fairness in AI falls&#x27; and systematically extracted all six axis label words organized into three axes: Axis 1 (Standardized/Localized), Axis 2 (Egalitarian/Utilitarian), and Axis 3 (Consequential/Deontological). The final results were properly saved to &#x27;final_axis_labels_extraction.json&#x27; with complete documentation. PLAN alignment: 100% complete - mission accomplished. The code successfully: (1) Found AI regulation papers from arXiv June 2022, (2) Located the specific figure with three axes containing label words at both ends, (3) Extracted all six axis label words as required.

I successfully searched for AI regulation papers originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022, identified the specific paper &#x27;Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation&#x27; (arXiv:2207.01510), and extracted all six axis label words from Figure 1 which contains three axes with label words at both ends. The six axis label words are: 1. Standardized, 2. Localized, 3. Egalitarian, 4. Utilitarian, 5. Consequential, 6. Deontological. These are organized into three axes: Axis 1 (Standardized/Localized), Axis 2 (Egalitarian/Utilitarian), and Axis 3 (Consequential/Deontological). The figure is titled &#x27;Three identified axes along which the debate about regulation of fairness in AI falls&#x27; and shows the debate framework for AI regulation policy. All results have been documented and saved to workspace files including the original PDFs, extracted text, and final analysis.

This code implements a comprehensive search strategy using both Google search and the arXiv API to find articles in the physics.soc-ph category. I first execute 5 targeted Google search queries looking for arXiv physics and society articles from August 2016 (arXiv ID format 1608.XXXXX), then use the arXiv API with specific date ranges and category filters. For each paper found, I check the submission date to identify August 11, 2016 papers and search the title and abstract for any of the six target axis label words (Standardized, Localized, Egalitarian, Utilitarian, Consequential, Deontological). The search results are systematically organized and saved to JSON format, with special highlighting of papers that contain the target axis label words. This approach should identify the specific Physics and Society article from August 11, 2016 that contains one of the six axis label words used to describe societal types.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the physics.soc-ph paper search from August 11, 2016. The script successfully executed both Google searches and arXiv API queries, found 113 total physics.soc-ph papers with 8 papers specifically from August 11, 2016, and identified 1 paper with axis label words. **KEY FINDING**: Paper &#x27;Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints&#x27; (arXiv:1608.03637v1) published on August 11, 2016 contains the axis label word &#x27;egalitarian&#x27; - this appears to be the target paper. The comprehensive search results were saved to &#x27;physics_society_august_11_2016_search.json&#x27; (73,783 bytes). PLAN alignment: 100% complete - successfully identified the August 11, 2016 physics.soc-ph paper containing one of the six axis label words (Egalitarian).

Focus on identifying papers that discuss artificial intelligence regulation, policy, or governance submitted during June 2022. Look for papers that contain figures with three axes where each axis has label words at both ends. Extract and analyze these papers to identify the specific figure and document all six axis label words (two words per axis for three axes total).&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific AI regulation paper from June 2022 that contains the three-axis figure before we can find the label words, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to locate relevant AI regulation papers from June 2022 and identify which one contains the described figure with axis labels, (4) This establishes the foundation for subsequently searching Physics and Society articles from August 11, 2016 to find which label word describes a type of society&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;MISSION ACCOMPLISHED - The PLAN has been completely fulfilled. I successfully searched for AI regulation papers originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022, identified the specific paper &#x27;Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation&#x27; (arXiv:2207.01510), and extracted all six axis label words from Figure 1 which contains three axes with label words at both ends. The six axis label words are: 1. Standardized, 2. Localized, 3. Egalitarian, 4. Utilitarian, 5. Consequential, 6. Deontological. These are organized into three axes: Axis 1 (Standardized/Localized), Axis 2 (Egalitarian/Utilitarian), and Axis 3 (Consequential/Deontological). The figure is titled &#x27;Three identified axes along which the debate about regulation of fairness in AI falls&#x27; and shows the debate framework for AI regulation policy. All results have been documented and saved to workspace files including the original PDFs, extracted text, and final analysis. The objective is 100% complete.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Search for Physics and Society articles submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016 to identify which article contains one of the six axis label words (Standardized, Localized, Egalitarian, Utilitarian, Consequential, Deontological) used to describe a type of society. Focus on finding articles in the physics.soc-ph category or related social physics topics that use any of these terms to characterize different societal types or structures.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the necessary next step because: (1) The previous research successfully identified the AI regulation paper from June 2022 and extracted all six axis label words from the three-axis figure, (2) We now need to search Physics and Society articles from the specific date of August 11, 2016 to find which of these words describes a type of society, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the relevant Physics and Society article and identify which axis label word is used to describe a societal type, (4) This will complete the TASK by connecting the axis label word from the AI regulation paper to its usage in describing society types in the Physics and Society literature&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;MISSION ACCOMPLISHED - The PLAN has been completely fulfilled. I successfully searched for Physics and Society articles submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016, and identified the specific article containing one of the six target axis label words. **KEY FINDING**: The paper &#x27;Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints&#x27; (arXiv:1608.03637v1) was published on August 11, 2016, and contains the axis label word &#x27;egalitarian&#x27; - one of the six words used to describe types of society (Standardized, Localized, Egalitarian, Utilitarian, Consequential, Deontological). The comprehensive search executed both Google searches and arXiv API queries, found 113 total physics.soc-ph papers with 8 papers specifically from August 11, 2016, and successfully identified 1 paper with the target axis label words. The search results were systematically organized and saved to &#x27;physics_society_august_11_2016_search.json&#x27; (73,783 bytes). The objective is 100% complete - arXiv:1608.03637v1 is the answer to the search for a Physics and Society article from August 11, 2016 containing one of the six axis label words used to describe societal types.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted in the HISTORY: (1) The developer successfully identified the AI regulation paper &#x27;Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation&#x27; (arXiv:2207.01510) originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022, which contains Figure 1 with three axes having label words at both ends, (2) All six axis label words were extracted: Standardized, Localized, Egalitarian, Utilitarian, Consequential, and Deontological, (3) The developer then searched Physics and Society articles submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016 and found the paper &#x27;Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints&#x27; (arXiv:1608.03637v1), (4) This Physics and Society paper uses the word &#x27;egalitarian&#x27; - one of the six axis label words from the AI regulation paper - to describe a type of society. Final answer: egalitarian&quot;,<br>}</p></div>
