Focus on finding authoritative sources that confirm whether he was born in Lyon (Rhône department) or another location in France. Search for biographical information using keywords including 'Leo Arnaud birthplace France department', 'Noel Arnaud born Lyon Rhône', 'Leo Arnaud composer birth location France', and cross-reference multiple biographical sources to verify the specific French department name.",
    "description": 'This verification step is necessary because: (1) The previous research identified Leo Arnaud as the French-born composer who worked for MGM (a company that produced early Technicolor films) and composed Olympic theme music, but we need to confirm the exact French department of his birth, (2) The HISTORY mentions Lyon, France as his birthplace, which would place him in the Rhône department, but this needs definitive confirmation, (3) Expected outcome is to verify the specific French department name to provide the final answer to the original TASK, (4) This completes the task by identifying the precise geographical administrative division in France where this composer was born',
