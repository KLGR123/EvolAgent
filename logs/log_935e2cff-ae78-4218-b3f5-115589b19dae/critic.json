  "final_answer": "Research",
  "reason": "Task decomposition: The question requires (1) identifying content violations on the Legume Wikipedia page from 2022 before December, (2) determining the three core Wikipedia content policies that were violated, and (3) specifying what 'R' stands for in that policy framework. Member evaluation: Member 1 conducted the most comprehensive analysis, documenting 8 specific policy violation incidents through systematic examination of Wikipedia's public logs and revision history. Their research identified 'or' (original research) as the most common violation type and established the three core policies as NOR (No Original Research), NPOV (Neutral Point of View), and V (Verifiability). Member 2 provided correct identification of the three core policies and accurately stated that 'R' stands for 'Research' in the OR policy, but lacked detailed verification through actual log analysis. Member 3 performed thorough research identifying 7 violation incidents and confirmed the same three core policies, with 'R' representing 'RESEARCH' from No Original Research policy. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence: All members correctly identified Wikipedia's three core content policies (NOR/NPOV/V) and unanimously determined that 'R' stands for 'Research' in the NOR (No Original Research) framework. The consistency across independent analyses, combined with Members 1 and 3's documented evidence from actual Wikipedia logs showing original research violations in 2022, provides high confidence in this conclusion. Final validation: The answer 'Research' is supported by multiple comprehensive investigations and aligns with Wikipedia's established policy framework.",
