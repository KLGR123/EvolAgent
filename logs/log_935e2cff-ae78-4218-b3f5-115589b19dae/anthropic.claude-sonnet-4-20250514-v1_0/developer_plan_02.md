# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 935e2cff-ae78-4218-b3f5-115589b19dae  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 05:20:12

## Plan Content
```
Analyze the detailed policy violations report in workspace/complete_policy_violations_report.txt and workspace/legume_policy_violations_final_report.json to identify the specific three core policies that were violated and determine what the letter 'R' represents in that policy framework. Focus on extracting the exact policy names or acronyms that were referenced in the violation incidents, and identify which three-letter policy system was being applied where 'R' is one of the components.
```

## Plan Description
```
This analysis step is necessary because: (1) The developer found 8 policy violation incidents and documented them, but we need to extract the specific three-core-policy framework to identify what 'R' stands for, (2) Previous search successfully located violation logs from 2022 before December on the Legume Wikipedia page, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the exact three-letter policy acronym system and determine R's meaning, (4) This directly answers the TASK question about what 'R' represents in the three core policies framework
