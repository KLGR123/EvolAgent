    "plan": "Search OpenReview.net for papers accepted at the NeurIPS 2022 Conference by authors named Yuri. Focus on identifying papers where an author's first name is 'Yuri' and extract their acceptance status and recommendation details. Look for papers with 'certain' recommendation status specifically. Use OpenReview's search functionality or API to filter by conference (NeurIPS 2022), author name (Yuri), and acceptance status.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify all papers by authors named Yuri at NeurIPS 2022 before filtering by recommendation status, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain a list of NeurIPS 2022 papers with authors named Yuri and their corresponding recommendation details, (4) This establishes the foundation for counting papers with 'certain' recommendation status",
