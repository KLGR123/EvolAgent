    "description": "This implementation searches OpenReview.net for NeurIPS 2022 papers by authors named Yuri, focusing on extracting acceptance status and recommendation details. The approach is comprehensive and systematic:\n\n**Current Task Stage Analysis**: Initial search phase for OpenReview NeurIPS 2022 papers by authors with first name 'Yuri', with focus on finding papers with 'certain' recommendation status.\n\n**Approach Selection Reasoning**: \n1. **Multi-pattern venue search**: Testing various NeurIPS 2022 venue identifier formats since OpenReview uses different naming conventions\n2. **Author name filtering**: Searching for authors whose first name matches 'Yuri' (case-insensitive)\n3. **Detailed review extraction**: Fetching comprehensive review data including recommendations, decisions, ratings, and confidence scores\n4. **Targeted 'certain' status detection**: Specifically looking for papers with 'certain' recommendation status as requested\n5. **Comprehensive data collection**: Gathering acceptance status, venue information, and full recommendation details\n\n**How This Advances the Plan**: This code implements the complete workflow to find NeurIPS 2022 papers by Yuri authors and extract their acceptance/recommendation details. It handles the OpenReview API structure, filters by author names, and specifically searches for 'certain' recommendation statuses.\n\n**Relationship to Previous Iterations**: This is the initial implementation with no previous history. The approach uses systematic API exploration, multiple venue pattern matching, and thorough data extraction to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n**File Paths Created**: Will create `workspace/openreview_neurips_2022_yuri_authors.json` with detailed results including paper information, acceptance status, recommendations, and specific 'certain' status findings. Additional files may be created for search attempts or failed searches for debugging purposes.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code ran without crashing but failed to retrieve any NeurIPS 2022 papers due to API issues. Two main problems occurred: (1) Error parsing venue information - 'str' object has no attribute 'get' suggests the API response format was unexpected, and (2) All venue pattern searches returned HTTP 400 errors, indicating incorrect API parameters or endpoint usage. The code produced a failed search data file but achieved 0% of the **PLAN** objectives since no papers were found or analyzed. The OpenReview API appears to require different search parameters or endpoint structure than what was attempted. Recommended fixes: (1) Debug the venues API response format to handle the actual data structure, (2) Research OpenReview's current API documentation to find the correct venue identifiers and search parameters for NeurIPS 2022, (3) Try alternative search approaches like using different API endpoints or search filters.",

It then systematically filters for Yuri authors and extracts their acceptance status and recommendation details, specifically targeting 'certain' recommendations as requested.\n\n**Relationship to Previous Iterations**: This directly addresses the HTTP 400 errors and 'str' object parsing issues from the previous attempt. It uses the failed search data as a starting point and implements alternative API approaches based on OpenReview's actual response structure.\n\n**File Paths Created**: Will create `workspace/openreview_neurips_2022_yuri_authors_fixed.json` with successful results, and potentially `workspace/openreview_neurips_2022_all_papers.json` for reference data. The code includes comprehensive debugging output to understand API responses and paper structures for better analysis.",
