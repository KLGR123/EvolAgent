    "plan": "Search OpenReview.net for papers accepted at the NeurIPS 2022 Conference by authors named Yuri. Focus on identifying papers where an author's first name is 'Yuri' and extract their acceptance status and recommendation details. Look for papers with 'certain' recommendation status specifically. Use OpenReview's search functionality or API to filter by conference (NeurIPS 2022), author name (Yuri), and acceptance status.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to systematically search OpenReview.net for NeurIPS 2022 papers by authors named Yuri to establish the baseline dataset, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to identify all papers by authors named Yuri at NeurIPS 2022 and their recommendation statuses, (4) This provides the foundation for filtering specifically for papers with 'certain' recommendations and counting the results",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive analysis conducted by the developer: (1) A systematic search of OpenReview.net was performed for NeurIPS 2022 Conference papers by authors named Yuri, (2) The search identified 1 paper by Yuri authors: 'Statistical Learning and Inverse Problems: A Stochastic Gradient Approach' by Yuri Fonseca and Yuri Saporito, (3) This paper was accepted at NeurIPS 2022 with detailed review information extracted (ratings of 8: Strong Accept, 5: Borderline Accept, 7: Accept, and official Accept decision), (4) Crucially, the analysis found 0 papers with a 'certain' recommendation status - none of the papers by Yuri authors had this specific recommendation type. Final answer: 0 papers by an author named Yuri were accepted with a 'certain' recommendation at NeurIPS 2022.",
