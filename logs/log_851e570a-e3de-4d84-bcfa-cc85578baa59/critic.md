## Final Answer
```
BRINIEST
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Find the longest English word from a 4x4 Boggle board (ABRL/EITE/IONS/FPEI) using the words_alpha dictionary from GitHub, with alphabetical tie-breaking for equal-length words. All three members executed identical comprehensive approaches: (1) Downloaded the words_alpha dictionary (369,652-370,105 words depending on filtering), (2) Implemented systematic Boggle solvers using depth-first search with proper 8-directional adjacency rules, (3) Ensured no cell reuse within individual word paths through backtracking, (4) Validated all discovered words against the dictionary. Cross-analysis shows perfect convergence: All members found exactly 443 valid words and identified four 8-letter words as the longest: BRINIEST, BRIONIES, INERTIAE, and POINTREL. All correctly applied alphabetical ordering to select BRINIEST as the final answer. Individual evaluation reveals high methodological soundness across all approaches - Member 1 used class-based recursive DFS, Member 2 used systematic DFS with comprehensive validation, Member 3 used iterative stack-based algorithm. All implementations properly handled Boggle rules, adjacency checking, and dictionary validation. The unanimous result of BRINIEST with identical supporting evidence (443 total words, 4 eight-letter words) provides extremely high confidence in solution accuracy. No contradictions or gaps identified in any approach.
