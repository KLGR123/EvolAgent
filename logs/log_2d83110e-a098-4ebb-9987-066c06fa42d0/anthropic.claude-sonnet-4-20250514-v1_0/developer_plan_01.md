**Task ID:** 2d83110e-a098-4ebb-9987-066c06fa42d0  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

## Plan Content
```
Analyze the given sentence '.rewsna eht sa "tfel" drow eht fo etisoppo eht etirw ,ecnetnes siht dnatsrednu uoy fI' to determine if it requires decoding or translation. The sentence appears to be written in reverse character order. Reverse the entire sentence character by character to reveal the original English text, then follow the instructions contained within the decoded message.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) The TASK contains a sentence that appears to be encoded or reversed, requiring decoding to understand the actual instruction, (2) No previous analysis has been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to decode the sentence and reveal the true task requirements, (4) This directly addresses the core need to understand what the TASK is actually asking for before proceeding with execution

I\'ll reverse the entire string character by character to decode it, then follow the instructions contained within the decoded message.

The implementation correctly identified that the sentence was encoded using character-by-character reversal, successfully decoded the message to reveal \'If you understand this sentence, write the opposite of the word "left" as the answer.\', and properly followed the decoded instructions by determining that the opposite of \'left\' is \'right\'.
