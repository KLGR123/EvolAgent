Based on the comprehensive research conducted in the HISTORY, the original TASK premise contained a factual error - Arthur Morris never scored over 300 runs in any Test innings (his highest was 206). The research corrected this and identified that Don Bradman scored the first 300+ run Test innings (334 runs against England at Leeds in 1930), with Bill Woodfull as the Australian captain in that match. Further research confirmed that Bill Woodfull passed away on August 11, 1965, at age 67 in Tweed Heads, New South Wales, Australia. Final answer: 1965.',
