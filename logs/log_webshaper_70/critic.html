                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                The question premise appears to be factually incorrect - no MLB team in July 2010 replaced their manager with an interim manager who had his number retired by the Detroit Tigers.<br><br>
                <strong>True Answer:</strong><br>
                A. J. Hinch<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task analysis: Identify the manager replaced by an interim manager in July 2010, where the interim manager had his number retired by Detroit Tigers. All three members conducted extensive research but reached different conclusions about the question's validity. Member 1 performed the most systematic analysis: (1) Identified all July 2010 MLB managerial changes (Arizona Diamondbacks: A.J. Hinch fired July 1, replaced by Kirk Gibson; plus Washington Nationals and Seattle Mariners changes), (2) Comprehensively analyzed Detroit Tigers retired numbers (10 total numbers, including managers Sparky Anderson #11), (3) Critically verified Kirk Gibson's retirement status - confirmed he wore #23 but this number was NOT retired by Detroit Tigers, (4) Systematically eliminated all other candidates through cross-reference verification. Member 2 reached identical conclusions through independent verification, confirming Kirk Gibson's #23 was not retired and no other July 2010 interim managers had Detroit Tigers retired numbers. Member 3 initially suggested Kirk Gibson as the answer but failed to properly verify the retirement status requirement. Cross-analysis shows strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on the factual impossibility of the scenario, while Member 3's conclusion contains a critical verification gap. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that while Kirk Gibson became interim manager in July 2010 and had Detroit Tigers connections, his number was never retired by Detroit, making the question premise invalid. Confidence level: Very high based on systematic elimination of all possibilities.
