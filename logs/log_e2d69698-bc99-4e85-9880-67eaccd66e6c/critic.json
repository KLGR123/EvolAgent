  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the only US Survivor winner born in May as of August 2023, requiring comprehensive research of all winners and their birth dates. Member evaluation reveals significant contradictions: Member 1 identified 2 May-born winners (Tina Wesson and Vecepia Towery) but noted data quality issues with birth years showing 2001/2002 which are clearly inaccurate. Member 2 conducted the most rigorous analysis, achieving 70.5% success rate (31/44 winners) with birth date extraction and definitively identified Michele Fitzgerald (Season 32, born May 5, 1990) as the sole May-born winner through cross-verification of multiple official sources. Member 3 found no May-born winners with only 45.5% success rate (20/44 winners) and incomplete data coverage. Cross-analysis shows Member 1's data contains acknowledged inaccuracies, while Member 3's lower success rate likely missed key winners including Michele Fitzgerald. Member 2's methodology demonstrates superior research depth, higher data completeness, systematic cross-verification, and explicit confidence validation. Convergence assessment: Members 1 and 2 both identified May-born winners, while Member 3 found none, indicating data completeness issues in Member 3's approach. Resolution: Member 2's identification of Michele Fitzgerald is most reliable based on comprehensive coverage, official source verification, and methodological rigor. Final validation confirms Michele Fitzgerald from Season 32 as the definitive answer.",
