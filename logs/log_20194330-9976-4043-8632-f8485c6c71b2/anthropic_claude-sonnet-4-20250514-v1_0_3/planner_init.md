The analysis processed all 61 extracted frames, found birds in 59 frames (96.7%), with Giant Petrels appearing most frequently (83.6% of frames), followed by Emperor Penguins (16.4%) and Adelie Penguins (3.3%). Comprehensive results saved to 'bird_species_analysis_results.json' with detailed frame-by-frame analysis, species occurrence statistics, and methodology documentation.

### Determine hex color of 11th move landing cell on Excel grid avoiding blue cells

**TASK**: You are given this Excel file as a map. You start on the START cell and move toward the END cell. You are allowed to move two cells per turn, and you may move up, down, left, or right. You may not move fewer than two cells, and you may not move backward. You must avoid moving onto any blue cells. On the eleventh turn, what is the 6-digit hex code (without prefix) of the color of the cell where you land after moving?
