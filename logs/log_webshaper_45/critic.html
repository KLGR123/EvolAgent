                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                Mariano Sabino Otero<br><br>
                <strong>True Answer:</strong><br>
                Mariano S. Otero<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task analysis: Identify the non-voting delegate elected to U.S. Congress in 1879 from a territory that (1) established its first public high school in 1879, and (2) whose building later housed the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted systematic research identifying New Mexico Territory as meeting both criteria, with Las Vegas High School as the first public high school and Mariano Sabino Otero as the 1879 delegate, demonstrating methodical approach and accurate territorial identification. Member 2 employed similar comprehensive methodology, initially identifying New Mexico Territory and Las Vegas Academy, but then switched to Trinidad Romero as the delegate - showing strong research foundation but potential confusion in delegate identification. Member 3 initially pursued Dakota Territory and Richard F. Pettigrew, correctly identified the geographic inconsistency with the New Mexico Heart Institute connection, then self-corrected to focus on New Mexico Territory, ultimately reaching Mariano Sabino Otero as the final answer. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on New Mexico Territory as the correct territory (all members eventually agreed), with Las Vegas/Albuquerque high school establishment in 1879 consistently identified. Divergence occurred in delegate identification: Members 1 and 3 converged on Mariano Sabino Otero, while Member 2 identified Trinidad Romero. Resolution analysis: Historical verification shows Mariano Sabino Otero served as New Mexico Territory's delegate from 1879-1881, while Trinidad Romero served a different term. Member 3's self-correction process and geographic logic validation strengthens confidence in the New Mexico Territory identification. Synthesis evaluation: The combination of territorial identification (unanimous final agreement) and delegate verification (2/3 consensus with historical support) provides high confidence in Mariano Sabino Otero as the definitive answer.
