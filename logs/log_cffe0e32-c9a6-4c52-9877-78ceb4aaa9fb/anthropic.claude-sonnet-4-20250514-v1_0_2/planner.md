## Task Description
```
An office held a Secret Santa gift exchange where each of its twelve employees was assigned one other employee in the group to present with a gift. Each employee filled out a profile including three likes or hobbies. On the day of the gift exchange, only eleven gifts were given, each one specific to one of the recipient's interests. Based on the information in the document, who did not give a gift? Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/cffe0e32-c9a6-4c52-9877-78ceb4aaa9fb.docx

### Determining a no-backtracking closed walk through all Earl Smith’s plots in the spreadsheet

**TASK**: Each cell in the attached spreadsheet represents a plot of land. The color of the cell indicates who owns that plot. Green cells are plots owned by Earl Smith. Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking? For this question, consider backtracking to be any instance where Earl would enter a plot of land he had already entered since leaving his starting plot.

Key findings: Earl Smith owns 49 contiguous land plots covering a 16x6 area, with complete cell addresses and coordinates documented. Output files created: workspace/earl_smith_analysis_initial.json (initial analysis) and workspace/earl_smith_complete_analysis.json (comprehensive results with spatial analysis).

Apply graph theory algorithms to check if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in Earl's connected land area, considering movement constraints between adjacent plots only.",
    "description": "This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have the complete mapping of Earl's 49 land plots from the previous Excel analysis, (2) The core question about traversing all plots without backtracking remains unanswered - this is a classic Hamiltonian cycle problem, (3) Expected outcome is a definitive yes/no answer with path verification if one exists, (4) This directly addresses the main TASK requirement to determine if Earl can complete the specified traversal",

    "description": "**HAMILTONIAN PATH ANALYSIS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**\n\nThe PLAN has been fully executed with definitive results:\n\n**FINAL ANSWER: NO** - Earl cannot walk through every plot he owns exactly once and return to his starting plot without backtracking.\n\n**Complete Analysis Summary:**\n\n1. **Data Extraction (✅ Complete)**: Successfully loaded Earl's 49 green plots from the workspace analysis file, extracting precise row/column coordinates for each plot.\n\n2. **Graph Construction (✅ Complete)**: Built an adjacency graph with 49 nodes (plots) and 58 edges, connecting only horizontally and vertically adjacent plots. Verified the graph is connected (essential prerequisite for Hamiltonian cycle possibility).\n\n3. **Hamiltonian Cycle Detection (✅ Complete)**: Implemented backtracking algorithm that systematically explored all possible paths through Earl's connected land area. The algorithm completed efficiently in 0.050 seconds and definitively determined that no Hamiltonian cycle exists.\n\n**Technical Results:**\n- Graph structure: 49 nodes, 58 edges, average degree 2.37\n- Graph connectivity: CONNECTED (necessary condition met)\n- Hamiltonian cycle: DOES NOT EXIST (sufficient condition failed)\n- Algorithm: Backtracking with complete path exploration\n- Computation time: 0.050 seconds\n\n**Practical Implications for Earl:**\nEarl's desired walking route is mathematically impossible given his land layout. The adjacency constraints of his 49 plots do not permit a path that visits each plot exactly once and returns to the starting point. Earl would need to either:\n- Accept visiting some plots more than once during his walk, or\n- Accept not returning to his starting plot (pursue a Hamiltonian path instead of cycle)\n\n**Output Files Created:**\n- `workspace/earl_hamiltonian_graph.json`: Complete graph structure and adjacency data\n- `workspace/hamiltonian_cycle_results.json`: Detailed algorithm results and conclusions\n\nThe graph theory analysis is complete and the Hamiltonian path problem has been definitively solved. No further algorithmic analysis is required.",
