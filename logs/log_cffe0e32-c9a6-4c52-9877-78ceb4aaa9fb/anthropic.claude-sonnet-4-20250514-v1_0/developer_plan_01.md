# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** cffe0e32-c9a6-4c52-9877-78ceb4aaa9fb  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 20:41:52

## Plan Content
```
Parse and analyze the attached Word document data/gaia/2023/validation/cffe0e32-c9a6-4c52-9877-78ceb4aaa9fb.docx to extract information about the Secret Santa gift exchange. Identify all twelve employees, their assigned gift recipients, their profile information including likes/hobbies, and the eleven gifts that were actually given on the exchange day. Create a comprehensive mapping to determine which employee failed to give their assigned gift.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the document structure and extract all Secret Santa assignment data before determining who didn't participate, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete employee profiles, gift assignments, and actual gift distribution data, (4) This provides the foundation needed to identify the missing gift-giver by comparing assigned vs. actual gift exchanges

    "description": "Performing final analysis to definitively identify which employee failed to give their assigned gift. I'm systematically matching each of the 11 given gifts to their most likely givers based on recipient interests and assignment mappings. The approach involves: (1) First identifying gifts with clear, unique giver matches, (2) Then resolving ambiguous cases by cross-referencing assignment relationships, and (3) Finally determining which of the 12 assigned givers is not accounted for in the gift-to-giver mapping. This systematic elimination process will reveal the one employee who failed to participate in the Secret Santa exchange, completing the comprehensive analysis required by the plan.",
