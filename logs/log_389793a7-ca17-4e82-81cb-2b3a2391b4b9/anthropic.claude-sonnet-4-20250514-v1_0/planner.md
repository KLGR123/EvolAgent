## Task Description
```
You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. In the reference file is a layout of the road and nearby houses. Each dash, "-", is a marker indicating a mile. Each capital H indicates a house located next to a mile marker, appearing above or below the stretch of road. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt

### Title: Find the non-tautological equivalence among six logical biconditionals

The one that doesn’t fit is:
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)

**TASK**: ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B)
¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B)
(A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A)
(A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B)
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)
¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B)

Which of the above is not logically equivalent to the rest? Provide the full statement that doesn't fit.

Systematically evaluate: (1) ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B) - De Morgan's Law, (2) ¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B) - De Morgan's Law, (3) (A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A) - Contrapositive, (4) (A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B) - Implication equivalence, (5) (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B) - Modified implication, (6) ¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B) - Negated implication. For each statement, verify whether both sides of the biconditional (↔) are logically equivalent by constructing truth tables with all possible combinations of A and B values (TT, TF, FT, FF). Identify which statement contains sides that are not equivalent to each other.",
    "description": "This is the optimal approach because: (1) The task requires identifying logical non-equivalence among biconditional statements, (2) No previous analysis exists, (3) Expected outcome is to systematically verify each biconditional and identify the false one, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to find the statement that doesn't represent a logical equivalence",

    "description": "Task completion confirmed - The logical equivalence analysis has been successfully completed with perfect execution. The code systematically analyzed all six given logical statements using comprehensive truth tables and identified the key findings: (1) Five statements are logically equivalent: ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B), ¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B), (A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A), (A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B), and ¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B). (2) One statement is NOT equivalent: Statement 5: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B) - this is the statement that contains sides which are not equivalent to each other. The analysis used proper truth tables with all possible combinations (TT, TF, FT, FF) and verified established logical laws including De Morgan's Laws, Contrapositive rule, and Implication equivalences. Detailed results were saved to workspace/logical_equivalence_analysis.json. The PLAN objective has been fully achieved - all six statements were systematically evaluated and the non-equivalent statement was successfully identified. No further development is required.",

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive logical equivalence analysis conducted by the developer using truth tables for all possible combinations of A and B values (TT, TF, FT, FF), the results show that five of the six statements are valid logical equivalences, while one is not. The statement that is NOT logically equivalent to the rest is: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B). This biconditional statement is false because the left side (¬A → B) and right side (A ∨ ¬B) do not have the same truth values across all possible input combinations. Final answer: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)',
