## Plan Content
```
Calculate the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses using the 4-mile radius coverage constraint. Apply an optimal tower placement algorithm considering that each tower can cover houses within 4 miles in either direction from its position. Use the house positions at miles 1, 9, 12, 21, 25, and 30 from the previous mapping analysis to determine the most efficient tower locations that provide complete coverage with minimum towers.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the critical final step because: (1) We have precise house locations mapped to specific mile markers from the previous analysis, (2) The developer has confirmed 7 houses at miles 1, 9, 12, 21, 25, and 30 with complete position data, (3) Expected outcome is to solve the coverage optimization problem using the 4-mile radius constraint and return the minimum number of towers as a positive integer, (4) This directly answers the TASK requirement for the minimum tower count needed to cover all houses.

    "description": 'Implementing a greedy algorithm for the minimum interval covering problem to find optimal cell tower placement. The algorithm works by: (1) Starting with the leftmost uncovered house, (2) Placing a tower at the rightmost position that can still cover this house, which maximizes coverage for subsequent houses, (3) Repeating until all houses are covered. This approach ensures the minimum number of towers needed. Each tower covers an 8-mile diameter (4 miles in each direction), and houses are located at miles 1, 9, 12, 21, 25, and 30. The solution will determine both the minimum number of towers and their optimal positions for complete coverage.',
