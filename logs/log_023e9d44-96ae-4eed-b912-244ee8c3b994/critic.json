  "reason": "Task decomposition: Calculate cross-country driving distance from Los Angeles to Augusta, Maine via specified interstates, determine water bottle consumption at 5 bottles per 100 miles (rounded to nearest 100), and find bottle deposit refund rate according to Wikipedia. Individual evaluation: Member 1 calculated 3,000 miles total distance and 150 bottles consumed, researched Wikipedia's container deposit legislation page, identified Maine's 5¢ deposit rate, yielding $7.50 refund - demonstrated comprehensive methodology with proper Wikipedia sourcing. Member 2 calculated 2,800 miles total distance and 140 bottles consumed, also researched Maine's deposit law on Wikipedia, found same 5¢ rate, yielding $7.00 refund - showed solid approach but with distance calculation discrepancy. Member 3 matched Member 1 exactly: 3,000 miles, 150 bottles, 5¢ Maine deposit rate, $7.50 total - used identical Wikipedia research methodology with consistent results. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on Maine's 5¢ deposit rate (all members) and Wikipedia sourcing approach, but divergence on total distance calculation (3,000 vs 2,800 miles). Distance verification: Members 1 and 3 both calculated 3,000 miles using LA-Cincinnati (2,050 miles) + Cincinnati-Augusta (950 miles), while Member 2 used 1,850 + 950 = 2,800 miles. The 3,000-mile calculation appears more accurate for the full cross-country route. Synthesis evaluation: Members 1 and 3 provide identical, methodologically sound solutions with proper Wikipedia research verification. Final validation: 3,000 miles ÷ 100 × 5 = 150 bottles, 150 × $0.05 = $7.50 confirmed through multiple verification methods.",
