    "plan": 'Research the driving distance from Los Angeles, California to Cincinnati, Ohio via Interstate 40, and then from Cincinnati, Ohio to Augusta, Maine via Interstate 90. Calculate the total mileage for this cross-country route and determine how many water bottles will be consumed based on the rate of 5 bottles per 100 miles traveled (rounded to the nearest 100 miles).',
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the total driving distance to calculate water bottle consumption, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this route, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain accurate mileage data for both I-40 (LA to Cincinnati) and I-90 (Cincinnati to Augusta) segments, (4) This provides the foundation needed to calculate the number of water bottles that will be recycled and determine the refund amount according to Wikipedia's bottle deposit information",

    "description": 'Task completion confirmed. The previous implementation successfully fulfilled all PLAN requirements: (1) Researched driving distances from Los Angeles to Cincinnati via Interstate 40 (2,050 miles) and Cincinnati to Augusta via Interstate 90 (950 miles), (2) Calculated total cross-country route mileage of 3,000 miles, (3) Applied rounding to nearest 100 miles (3,000 miles was already at nearest 100), and (4) Determined water bottle consumption of 150 bottles based on 5 bottles per 100 miles traveled. The tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with comprehensive route analysis, proper calculations, well-formatted results, and detailed documentation files created in workspace. All objectives met with no further development needed.',

    "plan": 'Research bottle deposit laws and refund rates in Maine according to Wikipedia, since Augusta, Maine is the final destination where the water bottles will be recycled. Extract the specific refund amount per bottle that Maine provides for recycling water bottles, and then calculate the total refund amount for the 150 water bottles that will be consumed during the 3,000-mile cross-country trip.',
    "description": "This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have established that 150 water bottles will be consumed during the 3,000-mile trip from Los Angeles to Augusta via I-40 and I-90, (2) The bottles will be recycled at the end destination (Augusta, Maine), so Maine's bottle deposit laws apply, (3) Expected outcome is to find Maine's specific bottle deposit refund rate from Wikipedia and calculate the total dollar amount for 150 bottles, (4) This will complete the TASK by determining exactly how many dollars will be received back for recycling the water bottles according to Wikipedia's information on bottle deposit laws",

    "description": "Task completion confirmed. The previous implementation successfully fulfilled all PLAN requirements: (1) Researched Maine bottle deposit laws via Wikipedia's 'Container deposit legislation in the United States' page, (2) Successfully extracted the specific refund amount of 5¢ ($0.05) per bottle for water bottles according to Maine's Returnable Beverage Container Law from 1978, and (3) Calculated the total refund amount of $7.50 for the 150 water bottles that will be consumed during the 3,000-mile cross-country trip (150 bottles × $0.05 = $7.50). The Wikipedia research was comprehensive, finding multiple Maine references including the key information that Maine charges '5¢ on fruit juice, soda, beer and bottled water.' The tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with thorough research documentation, accurate calculations, and proper file outputs created in workspace. The final answer of $7.50 total refund amount has been clearly established and documented.",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive analysis conducted by the developer: (1) The total driving distance from Los Angeles to Augusta via I-40 (LA to Cincinnati) and I-90 (Cincinnati to Augusta) was calculated as 3,000 miles, (2) Using the consumption rate of 5 bottles per 100 miles, this results in 150 water bottles consumed during the trip, (3) Research of Maine's bottle deposit laws via Wikipedia's 'Container deposit legislation in the United States' page revealed that Maine provides a 5¢ ($0.05) refund per water bottle under their Returnable Beverage Container Law, (4) The total refund calculation: 150 bottles × $0.05 = $7.50.
