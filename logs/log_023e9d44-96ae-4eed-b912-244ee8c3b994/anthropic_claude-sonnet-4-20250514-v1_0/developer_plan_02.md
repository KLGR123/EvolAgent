# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Calculate the total number of water bottles consumed during the 3,000-mile trip (5 bottles per 100 miles, rounded to nearest 100), then research bottle deposit refund rates by state according to Wikipedia. Focus on identifying which states along the I-40/I-90 route from Los Angeles to Augusta have bottle deposit laws and determine the applicable refund rate for 12-ounce water bottles. Since the trip ends in Augusta, Maine, prioritize Maine's bottle deposit rate as the likely location for recycling.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have established the total driving distance of 3,000 miles from the previous analysis, (2) We need to calculate water bottle consumption: 3,000 miles = 30 hundreds, so 30 × 5 = 150 bottles total, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the bottle deposit refund rate in Maine (end destination) or other applicable states along the route according to Wikipedia, (4) This will enable us to calculate the total dollar amount received from recycling 150 water bottles and complete the TASK

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Indiana’s First Governor, 23.6-Mile I-65 Naming Resolution, and 1783 County Origins

**Description**: Research Indiana's first governor to identify who this person was, then search for information about a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 that was named in their honor. Focus on finding when the Indiana legislative body passed the resolution to designate this highway section. Additionally, identify which Indiana county was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 to determine the specific location of this Interstate 65 section.

**Use Cases**:
- State transportation departments automating extraction of legislative resolutions and highway naming details to update GIS asset databases and ensure accurate route signage
- Historical societies compiling interconnected colonial-era county boundaries and modern infrastructure designations for curated museum exhibits and educational materials
- Urban planners integrating memorial highway designations and legislative history into comprehensive city development reports and public consultation documents
- Academic researchers conducting comparative analyses of state commemorative practices by correlating governors’ tenures with named transportation corridors and passage dates
- Newsrooms generating enriched multimedia timelines for feature articles on infrastructure naming controversies by programmatically retrieving legislative records and historical county data
- Legal teams verifying the legislative authority and specific dates behind highway naming agreements to support compliance audits and drafting of municipal ordinances
- Tourism app developers embedding contextual historical narratives—such as colonial county origins and governor memorial dedications—into driving route guides to enhance traveler engagement

### Development Step 1: 2011 Nickel, Cobalt, PGM Recovery from Automotive Catalysts via Lithium-Calcination and Bioleaching

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify academic works, technical publications, or books from 2011 that cover hydrometallurgical processes for recovering nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals from spent automotive catalysts. Focus on searching for keywords including '2011 nickel cobalt platinum recovery automotive catalysts', 'calcination lithium salts metal recovery 2011', 'Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bioleaching cobalt 2011', 'two-stage bioleaching low-grade cobalt ores', and 'spent catalyst metal recovery 2011 publisher'. Look for technical books, conference proceedings, journal special issues, or industry publications that detail both the calcination process with lithium salts and the specific bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for cobalt ore processing.

**Use Cases**:
- Mining R&D team conducting a patent and literature landscape analysis on 2011 hydrometallurgical methods for nickel, cobalt, and platinum recovery to inform the development of a new recycling process.
- Environmental consultancy compiling case studies on Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bioleaching from 2011 publications to evaluate bioremediation strategies for heavy-metal-contaminated soils near automotive dismantling sites.
- Academic librarian curating a graduate-level syllabus on advanced metal recovery techniques, ensuring all seminal 2011 works on calcination with lithium salts and bioleaching are included for materials science students.
- Government regulatory body auditing an industrial catalyst recycling facility’s compliance by cross-referencing 2011 technical standards and industry publications on spent automotive catalyst metal recovery.
- Battery manufacturer’s supply-chain sustainability group examining 2011 hydrometallurgical research to identify proven cobalt-recycling routes and integrate closed-loop recovery into their production line.
- Scientific publisher scouting high-impact 2011 conference proceedings and special journal issues on platinum-group metal recovery to plan a retrospective special edition on recycling technologies.
- Materials engineering consultancy performing competitive intelligence on two-stage bioleaching and lithium-salt calcination processes by extracting 2011 technical book and journal references to advise clients.
- Industrial equipment supplier researching historical implementations from 2011 of bioleaching reactors and calcination systems in automotive catalyst recycling plants to tailor new process-automation solutions.

### Development Step 4: Indiana’s First Governor’s Namesake 23.6-Mile I-65 Section: Resolution Date and County

**Description**: Research Indiana's first governor to identify who this person was, then search for information about a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 that was named in their honor. Focus on finding when the Indiana legislative body passed the resolution to designate this highway section. Additionally, identify which Indiana county was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 to determine the specific location of this Interstate 65 section.

**Use Cases**:
- Transportation GIS asset management and memorial highway resolution indexing for state Departments of Transportation
- Legislative archival workflow automation and metadata extraction for public records in state archives
- Historical tourism app content curation and timeline generation linking colonial counties to modern infrastructures
- Government affairs monitoring and analysis of highway naming resolutions for lobbying firms and policy consultants
- Educational module development and interactive timeline creation for university state history courses
- Map publisher compliance verification and design validation of memorial highway naming based on legislative statutes
- Civic tech transparency dashboard creation for citizens to explore transportation asset naming and resolution data
- Academic geospatial research and demographic analysis correlating 18th-century county boundaries with present-day highway routes

### Development Step 1: Indiana’s First Governor and 23.6-Mile I-65 Section: Dedication Date and County Location

**Description**: Research Indiana's first governor to identify who this person was, then search for information about a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65 that was named in their honor. Focus on finding when the Indiana legislative body passed the resolution to designate this highway section. Additionally, identify which Indiana county was established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783 to determine the specific location of this Interstate 65 section.

**Use Cases**:
- Local history digital archive curation and highway naming timeline verification for state archives departments
- State transportation department resolution tracking and GIS tagging of memorial highways for infrastructure management
- Tourism board historical tours planning and digital mapping of commemoration routes for travel guide apps
- University history department archival research and dataset creation for Indiana statehood and infrastructure studies
- Legislative affairs monitoring and automated retrieval of statutes and resolutions for policymaker briefing reports
- Nonprofit heritage society documentation and interactive web mapping for commemorative highway markers
- Journalism deep-dive into regional history and factual verification for investigative news features on state memorial roads
- Educational technology platform content generation and fact-checking for interactive textbooks on Indiana history
