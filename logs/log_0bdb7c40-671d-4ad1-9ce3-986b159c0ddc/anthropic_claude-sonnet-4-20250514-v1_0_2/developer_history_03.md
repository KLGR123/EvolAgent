The implementation follows a comprehensive extraction strategy: (1) Downloads the complete HTML page from the official NASA APOD archive, (2) Parses the content using BeautifulSoup to extract the title, main image details, and explanation text, (3) Searches for astronaut-related keywords like 'astronaut', 'spacewalk', 'EVA', and 'space suit', (4) Looks for size/perspective references such as 'smaller', 'distance', 'perspective', and 'scale' to identify the visual effect described in the plan, (5) Extracts credit information and attempts to identify specific astronaut names using regex patterns, (6) Saves all extracted data in multiple formats (HTML, text, and JSON) for thorough analysis. The code includes extensive print statements to show the extraction progress and findings, making it easy for the tester to verify that we're successfully accessing the correct APOD entry and identifying the two astronauts with the size difference effect.",

Charles \'Pete\' Conrad appears much smaller as a reflection in Bean\'s helmet visor, along with the lunar horizon. This creates the dramatic size difference effect where one astronaut (Conrad) appears much smaller than the other (Bean) due to the perspective - Bean fills the frame as the main subject while Conrad is visible only as a small reflection in the helmet.\n\n**Complete APOD Content Extracted:**\n- Full title and description documenting this as a masterpiece of space photography\n- Image details and source path\n- Credit information identifying Charles Conrad as photographer\n- Complete explanation text describing the lunar soil collection activities\n- Mission context: Apollo 12, November 1969, Moon\'s Ocean of Storms\n\nAll required information has been successfully extracted and saved to workspace files (HTML, text, and JSON formats).

The code includes extensive print statements to show the research progress and findings, making it easy to track the identification of Conrad's group and the compilation of all group members.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful with partial completion - Code successfully confirmed Charles 'Pete' Conrad was a member of NASA Astronaut Group 2 (selected 1962, nicknamed 'The New Nine') and extracted comprehensive research data. The Wikipedia verification clearly shows Conrad listed among the nine astronauts. However, the member list extraction failed - the code captured 128 items including many non-astronaut entries like 'About Wikipedia', 'Bahasa Melayu', dates ('In March', 'In July'), and book titles instead of the actual 9 astronaut names. While the code found some correct names (Neil Armstrong, Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, Ed White, John Young), the extraction logic was too broad and pulled irrelevant text. **PLAN** alignment: 70% complete - Conrad's group identified correctly, but the complete accurate member list still needs proper extraction. Next step: Fix the member extraction logic to specifically target the 9 astronaut names from NASA Astronaut Group 2, filtering out non-name entries and focusing on the core roster.",

The code specifically highlights Charles 'Pete' Conrad as the target astronaut and provides complete context about his Group 2 membership, ensuring the **PLAN** objective is fully accomplished with accurate, verified information about all 9 group members.",

    "description": 'This implementation begins the spaceflight duration research by first inspecting the existing workspace files to understand what astronaut data we have from previous research. The code: (1) Searches for and examines any existing NASA Astronaut Group 2 roster files, carefully inspecting the JSON structure before loading to avoid errors, (2) Extracts the complete list of 9 astronauts with their known missions from previous research, (3) Creates a comprehensive research framework identifying what data we need (total cumulative flight time in days/hours/minutes for each astronaut as of August 2023), (4) Establishes a research strategy using official NASA records and authoritative spaceflight databases, (5) Notes special cases like Elliot See (killed in training, 0 flight time) and John Young (longest career spanning Gemini, Apollo, and Shuttle programs), (6) Saves the research plan and astronaut list to workspace for the next phase. The code includes extensive print statements showing the current astronaut roster and research objectives, setting up the foundation for detailed spaceflight duration data collection in subsequent iterations.',

    "feedback": "Execution failed - Code encountered a NameError: name 'astronaut_names' is not defined at line 262. The code successfully inspected existing workspace files and found astronaut group data, confirmed the research objective, and set up the research framework. However, the execution failed when trying to save research data because the variable 'astronaut_names' was not properly defined in the execution path taken. The code found existing roster data but couldn't locate the expected 'complete_member_roster' key, then attempted to use a fallback list of historically documented astronauts, but the variable assignment failed due to conditional logic issues. **PLAN** alignment: 30% - workspace inspection and research strategy completed, but the core objective of compiling spaceflight duration data was not achieved due to the runtime error. Recommended fix: Define the astronaut_names variable properly in all code paths, or restructure the conditional logic to ensure the variable is always defined before use in the final data compilation section.",

The code: (1) Starts with an empty astronaut_names list to prevent NameError, (2) First attempts to load data from the complete roster JSON file, carefully inspecting its structure before accessing keys, (3) If the complete roster is found, extracts the member data including names, nicknames, missions, and distinctions, (4) If no complete roster is available, falls back to the alternative group members file (while noting its problematic 128-entry structure), (5) Finally uses historically documented NASA Astronaut Group 2 members as a failsafe, ensuring astronaut_names is always properly populated, (6) Creates a comprehensive research framework with all 9 astronauts, their known missions, research complexity assessments, and special cases, (7) Saves both detailed JSON research data and a text summary for easy reference. The code includes extensive debugging output and proper error handling to prevent runtime issues while setting up the foundation for spaceflight duration research.",

The code established a comprehensive research plan specifying the need for cumulative flight time data in days/hours/minutes format as of August 2023, identified multiple authoritative data sources (NASA records, Spacefacts.de, Wikipedia), and noted special cases like Elliot See (0 flight time - killed in training) and John Young (extensive multi-program career). Research framework and astronaut list saved to workspace files. **PLAN** alignment: 25% complete - astronaut identification and research strategy established, but actual spaceflight duration data collection still needed.

    "description": 'This implementation conducts comprehensive spaceflight duration research for all 9 NASA Astronaut Group 2 members by: (1) Loading the research framework from previous iterations to get the complete astronaut list with known missions, (2) Implementing robust duration parsing functions that can handle various time formats (days/hours/minutes, d/h/m notation, time stamps) and convert everything to standardized total minutes for accurate comparison, (3) Creating a systematic research function that handles special cases (Elliot See - 0 flight time, Ed White - only Gemini 4), attempts Wikipedia searches for official flight time data, and falls back to mission-based duration estimation using historically accurate mission durations, (4) Researching each astronaut individually with proper error handling, saving Wikipedia pages for reference, and adding respectful delays between requests, (5) Compiling comprehensive results with detailed source attribution, research notes, and formatting flight times back to days/hours/minutes format, (6) Creating ranked summary tables sorted by total flight time and calculating group statistics including combined flight time and averages, (7) Saving both detailed JSON results and human-readable summary reports to workspace files. The code includes extensive progress reporting and handles the full scope of the **PLAN** objective to research spaceflight duration records for all Group 2 members as of August 2023.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code successfully researched and compiled spaceflight duration records for all 9 NASA Astronaut Group 2 members. The implementation loaded the research framework from previous work, systematically researched each astronaut using Wikipedia and mission-based estimation, and produced comprehensive results. For most astronauts, Wikipedia didn't contain explicit flight time data, so the code used historically accurate mission durations to calculate totals. Key findings: Pete Conrad leads with 49 days, 3 hours, 38 minutes; John Young has 34 days, 19 hours, 42 minutes; Jim Lovell accumulated 29 days, 19 hours, 5 minutes. The code properly handled special cases (Elliot See: 0 flight time - killed in training; Ed White: only Gemini 4 before Apollo 1 fire). Complete results show the group's combined flight time of 181 days, 14 hours, 35 minutes across 8 astronauts who flew in space. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - All 9 Group 2 members researched with total spaceflight duration in days/hours/minutes format, results saved to comprehensive JSON and summary files.
