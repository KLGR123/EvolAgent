# Developer Plan #2 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** dc28cf18-6431-458b-83ef-64b3ce566c10  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 04:42:24

## Plan Content
```
Manually list every attending adult and every attending kid who will eat carbs based on the narrative description, calculate total potatoes needed (adults at 1.5 potatoes each, kids at 0.5 each), convert total potatoes to pounds (0.5 lb per potato), compute the number of 5-lb bags by dividing total pounds by 5 and rounding up to the next whole bag, and report that integer.
```

## Plan Description
```
The prior plan requested a JSON file that does not exist; however, the narrative provides all necessary counts. This plan extracts counts directly from the description (11 adults eating carbs and 3 kids eating carbs), computes total potatoes (11 × 1.5 + 3 × 0.5 = 18 potatoes), converts to weight (18 × 0.5 lb = 9 lb), and determines bags needed (ceil(9 ÷ 5) = 2). This produces the final answer efficiently without external data files.
```

    "description": "Implementation rationale:\n(1) Current task stage: This code completes the final calculation of how many 5-lb bags of potatoes are needed.\n(2) Approach: Manually define two Python lists for attending adults and kids who will eat carbs (based on the narrative). Then use the given per-person rates (1.5 potatoes/adult, 0.5 potatoes/kid), convert total potatoes to pounds (0.5 lb each), and compute the number of 5-lb bags rounding up.\n(3) Advances the PLAN: It performs the arithmetic steps and outputs the single integer result as required by the PLAN.\n(4) Relationship to previous iterations: There is no HISTORY for this simple calculation; this is the first implementation of the PLAN.\n(5) File output: Creates 'workspace/potato_bag_count.txt' containing the integer number of bags needed. The script also prints intermediate variables for verification.",
