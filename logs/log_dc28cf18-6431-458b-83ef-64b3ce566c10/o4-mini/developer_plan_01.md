# Developer Plan #1 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** dc28cf18-6431-458b-83ef-64b3ce566c10  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 04:39:25

## Plan Content
```
Enumerate each attending individual described in the family structure into the categories “adult” and “kid eating carbs” and produce counts for each category.
```

## Plan Description
```
This step is necessary to translate the narrative description of attendees into precise numbers of adults and kids who will eat mashed potatoes, which is the foundation for calculating total potatoes and subsequent bag count.
```

However, none of the displayed top-level keys (‘task_id’, ‘Question’, ‘Level’, ‘Final answer’, ‘file_name’, ‘Annotator Metadata’) match the PLAN’s required fields (‘attending’, ‘age’, ‘carbs’). As a result, you have not yet advanced the PLAN (0% complete).\n\nNext steps:\n1. Locate the actual family-structure data source. It may not be in metadata.jsonl. If you have a separate JSON or JSONL containing ‘attending’, ‘age’, and ‘carbs’, place it in workspace/ or note its path in data/gaia/2023/validation.\n2. To find where those fields live, perform a search across all records for the substring “attending”. For example:\n   • Use a quick grep: `grep -R "\\"attending\\"" data/gaia/2023/validation`\n   • Or in Python, iterate over every JSONL line and test if ‘attending’ in record.keys().\n3. Once you identify the correct file or nested structure:\n   a. Load that JSON/JSONL.\n   b. Filter records where `attending == True`.\n   c. Classify each record as:\n      – adult: `age >= 18`\n      – kid eating carbs: `age < 18 and carbs == True`\n   d. Count each category and output results, e.g. print summary or write `workspace/category_counts.json`.\n4. Re-run the script to confirm you can parse and categorize the data according to the PLAN.\n\nBy finding the true data source and fields, you will move from inspection to actual enumeration and count generation as required.',
