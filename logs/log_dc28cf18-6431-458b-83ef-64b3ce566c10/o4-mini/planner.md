## Task Description
```
My family reunion is this week, and I was assigned the mashed potatoes to bring. The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma and her brother, her brother's daughter, and his daughter's family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato of mashed potatoes, except my second cousins don't eat carbs. The average potato is about half a pound, and potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. How many whole bags of potatoes do I need? Just give the number.

### Van Helsing’s Șirnea Vampire Puzzle: Determining Vampire Count via Truth and Lies

**TASK**: You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.

You travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.

In the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: "How many vampires are living in Șirnea". Everyone in the village gives the same response, "At least one of us is a human."

How many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?

    "description": "This is a classic logic puzzle that can be solved through logical deduction without requiring external research or computation. Let me analyze the scenario: (1) All 100 residents give the same answer: 'At least one of us is a human', (2) We know humans always tell the truth and vampires always lie, (3) If any humans exist in the village, then the statement 'At least one of us is a human' would be true, and humans would say it truthfully, (4) However, if vampires also say this same statement, they must be lying (since vampires always lie), which means the statement must be false, (5) For the statement to be false, there would need to be zero humans in the village, (6) But this creates a contradiction - if there are no humans, then vampires saying 'At least one of us is a human' would be telling the truth, which vampires cannot do, (7) The only logical resolution is that there must be exactly 99 vampires and 1 human - the human tells the truth about at least one human existing, while the 99 vampires lie by claiming the same thing (their lie being that they are implying they themselves might be the human). Final answer: 99 residents have been turned into vampires.",

### Determine missing edge piece’s two colors in jumbled Rubik’s Cube puzzle

**TASK**: A standard Rubik’s cube has been broken into cubes making up its sides. The cubes are jumbled, and one is removed. There are 6 cubes with one colored face, 12 edge cubes with two colored faces, and 8 corner cubes with three colored faces. All blue cubes have been found. All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube. The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow. For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found. The removed cube has two colors on its faces. What are they? Answer using a comma separated list, with the colors ordered alphabetically.

```
{
    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": "Analyze the Rubik's cube structure and systematically determine which cubes have been found based on the given constraints. Start by establishing the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cube composition: 6 center cubes (one colored face each), 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each), and 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each). Then work through each constraint: (1) All blue cubes found, (2) All cubes adjacent to orange center found plus orange center itself, (3) All green corners found, (4) All green that borders yellow found, (5) For all found orange cubes, their opposite face cubes are also found. Create a logical framework to track which specific cubes remain unfound, focusing on the edge cubes since the removed cube has exactly two colors. Determine the colors of the missing edge cube by process of elimination.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first approach because: (1) The task requires systematic logical deduction about cube positions and colors in a standard Rubik's cube, (2) No previous analysis exists in the history, (3) Expected outcome is to establish the cube structure and systematically apply the given constraints, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to identify the two colors on the removed cube through logical elimination",

    "description": "The **PLAN** has been successfully completed. The systematic analysis of the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube structure determined that exactly one edge cube is missing: 'White-Green' with colors White and Green. The analysis was accomplished through the following steps: (1) Established the standard cube composition with 6 centers, 12 edges, and 8 corners, (2) Applied all five constraints systematically to identify found cubes, (3) Used process of elimination to determine missing cubes, and (4) Verified that only one edge cube remains unfound. The tester has confirmed the analysis is correct and complete. The missing cube with exactly two colors has been definitively identified as having White and Green colors. All output files have been saved to workspace/rubiks_cube_analysis.json for reference.",

### Title: Find the non-tautological equivalence among six logical biconditionals

The one that doesn’t fit is:
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)

**TASK**: ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B)
¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B)
(A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A)
(A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B)
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)
¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B)

Which of the above is not logically equivalent to the rest? Provide the full statement that doesn't fit.

For each statement, verify whether both sides of the biconditional (↔) are logically equivalent by constructing truth tables with all possible combinations of A and B values (TT, TF, FT, FF). Identify which statement contains sides that are not equivalent to each other.",
    "description": "This is the optimal approach because: (1) The task requires identifying logical non-equivalence among biconditional statements, (2) No previous analysis exists, (3) Expected outcome is to systematically verify each biconditional and identify the false one, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to find the statement that doesn't represent a logical equivalence",

    "description": "Task completion confirmed - The logical equivalence analysis has been successfully completed with perfect execution. The code systematically analyzed all six given logical statements using comprehensive truth tables and identified the key findings: (1) Five statements are logically equivalent: ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B), ¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B), (A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A), (A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B), and ¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B). (2) One statement is NOT equivalent: Statement 5: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B) - this is the statement that contains sides which are not equivalent to each other. The analysis used proper truth tables with all possible combinations (TT, TF, FT, FF) and verified established logical laws including De Morgan's Laws, Contrapositive rule, and Implication equivalences. Detailed results were saved to workspace/logical_equivalence_analysis.json. The PLAN objective has been fully achieved - all six statements were systematically evaluated and the non-equivalent statement was successfully identified. No further development is required.",

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive logical equivalence analysis conducted by the developer using truth tables for all possible combinations of A and B values (TT, TF, FT, FF), the results show that five of the six statements are valid logical equivalences, while one is not. The statement that is NOT logically equivalent to the rest is: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B). This biconditional statement is false because the left side (¬A → B) and right side (A ∨ ¬B) do not have the same truth values across all possible input combinations. Final answer: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)',
