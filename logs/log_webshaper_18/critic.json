  "final_answer": "United Kingdom",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the publication country of a book about the only V-bomber converted into a tanker aircraft. This requires: (1) identifying which V-bomber was uniquely converted to tanker role, (2) locating books about this conversion, and (3) determining publication country. Individual member evaluation: All three members demonstrated excellent systematic research methodology and reached identical conclusions. Member 1 identified the Handley Page Victor as the sole V-bomber extensively converted for aerial refueling (K.1 and K.2 variants), found 5 books covering this conversion, and confirmed UK publication through publishers like Pen & Sword Aviation, Grub Street, Ian Allan Publishing, and Midland Publishing. Member 2 employed similar comprehensive approach, identifying Victor as primary tanker conversion with K.1/K.2 variants serving as RAF strategic tankers 1960s-1993, located 5 relevant books, all published in UK by British aviation publishers including Crowood Press, Grub Street, Warpaint Books. Member 3 conducted equally thorough research, distinguishing Victor from other V-bombers (Vulcan had limited tanker trials, Valiant retired early), identified specific books including 'Handley Page Victor: The History and Development of a Classic Jet' by Tim McLelland, 'Victor Boys' by Tony Blackman, 'RAF Victor Units' by Andrew Brookes, all published in UK. Convergence analysis: Perfect agreement across all members on key findings - Victor as only extensively converted V-bomber tanker, multiple books documenting conversion, UK as publication country. Cross-validation through multiple independent research paths confirms reliability. Final validation: All evidence consistently points to United Kingdom as publication country for books about Victor tanker conversions, which is logical given V-bombers were British aircraft with specialized UK aviation publishers covering this topic.",
