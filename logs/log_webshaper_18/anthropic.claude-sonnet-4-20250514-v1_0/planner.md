### Page Count of Robot Space Series Debut by Underwater-Welder Author & Dark Peter Pan Illustrator

**TASK**: "What is the number of pages in the book that is the first volume of a series, features a robot protagonist, takes place in space, is written by an author who also wrote a graphic novel about an underwater welder set in the deep ocean exploring the theme of unresolved paternal trauma, and is illustrated by an illustrator whose work is a graphic novel series that is a dark reimagining of Peter Pan's 'never grow up' theme, featuring immortal children surviving in a post-apocalyptic world, exploring themes of moral conflict between retaining innocence and fulfilling predatory instincts, includes non-linear storytelling with origin stories from the 1763 Black Forest and 1945 Hiroshima, is illustrated with black and white art punctuated by red accents, has a narrative structure emphasizing existential monotony through sparse dialogue, and ends with an unresolved cliffhanger involving tragic loss during human confrontation?"

**TASK**: In 2011, which publisher published a work covering a process that recovers nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals from spent automotive catalysts using calcination with lithium salts, and detailing a two-stage bioleaching method employing Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans targeting low-grade cobalt ores?

### Identify weight and adjacent-column swap causing checksum errors in modified ISBN-13 numbers

**TASK**: The following numbers function similarly to ISBN 13 numbers, however, their validation methods are slightly different. Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.
