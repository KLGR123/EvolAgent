    "description": "I'm researching the Unlambda programming language to understand its syntax and execution model, particularly focusing on the 'r' combinator. This is the foundational step to understand how the given code works. I'm gathering comprehensive information about Unlambda's combinatory logic system, its core combinators, execution model, and specifically how the 'r' (read) combinator functions. The research covers: (1) Basic language overview and design principles, (2) Core combinators and their functions, (3) Execution model and evaluation rules, (4) Detailed explanation of the 'r' combinator, (5) Church numeral representation system, (6) Example programs demonstrating 'r' usage. I'm saving this research to workspace/unlambda_research.txt for reference and to build upon in subsequent iterations. This establishes the foundation needed to analyze and understand any Unlambda code involving the 'r' combinator.",
