# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 4fc2f1ae-8625-45b5-ab34-ad4433bc21f8  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-02 17:04:55

## Plan Content
```
Search for English Wikipedia Featured Articles that were promoted in November 2016, specifically focusing on dinosaur-related articles. Use web search with targeted queries such as 'Wikipedia Featured Articles promoted November 2016 dinosaur', 'site:en.wikipedia.org Featured Article candidates November 2016', and 'Wikipedia FAC archive November 2016'. Look for the Featured Article Candidates (FAC) archive pages or Wikipedia project pages that list articles promoted to Featured Article status during that specific month, then identify which one is about a dinosaur and extract the nomination information including who submitted the nomination.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific dinosaur Featured Article promoted in November 2016 before finding its nominator, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate Wikipedia's Featured Article promotion records from November 2016 and identify the dinosaur article, (4) This directly targets the core TASK of finding the nomination details for that specific article

### Development Step 4: Extract July 3 2023 LOTR Wikipedia Internal Links Toward A Song of Ice and Fire

**Description**: Access the archived Wikipedia page for 'The Lord of the Rings' (book) as it appeared at the end of July 3, 2023. Use the Wayback Machine or Wikipedia's revision history to retrieve the specific version from that date. Extract all outbound links from the page content, focusing on internal Wikipedia links that could potentially lead toward 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. Create a comprehensive list of linked pages including literature, fantasy, author, publisher, and genre-related links that might serve as stepping stones in the path-finding process.

**Use Cases**:
- Competitive product mapping for market intelligence teams: archive the Wikipedia page of a rival’s flagship product, extract outbound links, and use BFS to uncover related technologies and collaborators leading to a specific emerging competitor.
- Academic literature exploration for research librarians: retrieve an archived revision of a foundational theory page, scrape internal links, and trace a path through related journals and authors to locate a target contemporary study.
- SEO internal linking audit for digital marketing agencies: load a historical snapshot of a high-traffic Wikipedia article, extract its link network, and identify the shortest chain of links that leads to pages optimized for a target keyword.
- Educational curriculum design for e-learning platforms: access the archived “Introduction to Biology” page, gather its outbound topic links, and map a learning path toward advanced genetics content using breadth-first search.
- Historical content evolution analysis for digital archivists: pull the July 2023 version of a political event page, extract links, and reconstruct how references to a specific legislation article appeared over time by finding link paths.
- Knowledge graph augmentation for AI research teams: scrape a past revision of an ontology page, collect entity links, and build a linkage chain to a new domain-specific concept to enrich the graph with contextual relationships.
- Due diligence support for consulting firms: obtain an archived corporate biography page, scrape its network of partner and subsidiary links, and run BFS to identify the shortest route to a target industry regulation page.

### Development Step 8: Extract July 3 2023 LOTR Wikipedia Outbound Links Toward A Song of Ice and Fire

**Description**: Access the archived Wikipedia page for 'The Lord of the Rings' (book) as it appeared at the end of July 3, 2023. Use the Wayback Machine or Wikipedia's revision history to retrieve the specific version from that date. Extract all outbound links from the page content, focusing on internal Wikipedia links that could potentially lead toward 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. Create a comprehensive list of linked pages including literature, fantasy, author, publisher, and genre-related links that might serve as stepping stones in the path-finding process.

**Use Cases**:
- Digital humanities research: mapping interlinking between fantasy literature pages on Wikipedia to analyze the thematic evolution from “The Lord of the Rings” to “A Song of Ice and Fire”
- Fan community website automation: extracting and categorizing internal links from the July 3, 2023 LOTR archive to automatically update character, location, and lore indexes
- Publishing market intelligence: analyzing Tolkien‐related outbound links and award categories to identify emerging authors and genre trends for editorial acquisition strategies
- Educational content auditing: retrieving archived Wikipedia snapshots and extracting author and genre links to ensure digital course materials cover all relevant literary themes
- Recommendation engine enhancement: using categorized fantasy and literature links to build graph-based book suggestions connecting Tolkien’s works to George R.R. Martin in a subscription reading platform
- Library digital archives quality control: monitoring Wikipedia revision history and link extraction to validate and enrich metadata for epic fantasy holdings
- SEO optimization for a literature blog: auditing outbound Wikipedia links from archived articles to update affiliate and resource pages with accurate genre and author cross‐references
- Wikipedia editorial QA: extracting archived link structures to detect missing or broken internal references and automate edit suggestions for epic fantasy articles

### Development Step 3: Extract 3 July 2023 LotR Wikipedia Links Toward A Song of Ice and Fire

**Description**: Access the archived Wikipedia page for 'The Lord of the Rings' (book) as it appeared at the end of July 3, 2023. Use the Wayback Machine or Wikipedia's revision history to retrieve the specific version from that date. Extract all outbound links from the page content, focusing on internal Wikipedia links that could potentially lead toward 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. Create a comprehensive list of linked pages including literature, fantasy, author, publisher, and genre-related links that might serve as stepping stones in the path-finding process.

**Use Cases**:
- Literary influence mapping for a graduate thesis: tracing thematic and authorial connections from “The Lord of the Rings” to “A Song of Ice and Fire” using archived Wikipedia link paths
- Recommendation engine enhancement for an online bookstore: leveraging BFS-driven Wikipedia link graphs to suggest related fantasy series and authors to shoppers
- Knowledge graph enrichment for a publisher’s metadata system: automatically linking books, genres, and authors by crawling archived Wikipedia pages and extracting internal link relationships
- Digital humanities classroom project: teaching students graph algorithms through hands-on exploration of real Wikipedia revisions and path-finding between classic fantasy novels
- SEO optimization for a fan news website: identifying high-traffic internal Wikipedia links between iconic fantasy properties to improve cross-linking and search rankings
- Virtual library assistant development: automating conversational context by dynamically finding shortest Wikipedia link routes between user queries on Tolkien and Martin works
- Game narrative tool for RPG designers: analyzing themed link networks in archived Wikipedia content to inspire quest chains and world-building elements based on fantasy literature lineages

### Development Step 6: Extract 2023-07-03 Internal Wikipedia Links from ‘The Lord of the Rings’ for ASOIAF Pathfinding

**Description**: Access the archived Wikipedia page for 'The Lord of the Rings' (book) as it appeared at the end of July 3, 2023. Use the Wayback Machine or Wikipedia's revision history to retrieve the specific version from that date. Extract all outbound links from the page content, focusing on internal Wikipedia links that could potentially lead toward 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. Create a comprehensive list of linked pages including literature, fantasy, author, publisher, and genre-related links that might serve as stepping stones in the path-finding process.

**Use Cases**:
- Fantasy literature scholars constructing a directed graph of narrative connections between major fantasy series by extracting and tracing internal Wikipedia links from archived page revisions
- Academic librarians automating the curation of dynamic bibliographies for genre collections by mining historic Wikipedia links to authors, publishers, and related works
- Digital marketing teams mapping competitive landscapes in the publishing industry by analyzing outbound link networks from high-priority genre pages to spot emerging authors
- Curriculum designers building thematic learning pathways across medieval literature and modern fantasy by following internal Wikipedia links between key topics and revisions
- Data analysts auditing shifts in public interest by comparing fantasy-related link centrality on Wikipedia before and after major book releases or media adaptations
- Recommendation engine developers enriching knowledge graphs with genre relationships by harvesting and connecting fantasy author and series links from historical Wikipedia snapshots
- Diversity audit researchers examining the evolution of author representation in fantasy literature by extracting and analyzing link patterns from archived page versions

    "description": 'This code implements a comprehensive search strategy to find Wikipedia Featured Articles promoted in November 2016, specifically focusing on dinosaur-related articles. The approach uses multiple search vectors: (1) Direct access to Wikipedia Featured Article Candidates (FAC) archive pages using common URL patterns, (2) Searching main Wikipedia FAC pages for November 2016 references, and (3) Targeted searches of specialized pages like WikiProject Dinosaurs and Featured Article logs. For each successful page access, the code analyzes content for dinosaur-related keywords (dinosaur, fossil, paleontology, etc.) and November 2016 date references, extracts potential article candidates with their context, and saves all HTML content to workspace files for detailed analysis. The comprehensive results are saved to a JSON file that tracks search metadata, successful results, and promising leads. This systematic approach maximizes the chances of finding the specific dinosaur-related Featured Article promoted in November 2016 along with its nomination details.',

The code accessed the correct FAC archive page for November 2016 but reported no dinosaur content (this needs verification). One key success: found 'Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Featured_log/November_2016' which is exactly what we need for the PLAN. However, the variable scope error prevented proper analysis of 2 important dinosaur-related pages. PLAN alignment: 60% - found the right pages but can't analyze them due to the bug. Immediate fix needed: Define 'page_text = soup.get_text().lower()' before the content analysis section in the log search loop. Also recommend manually analyzing the saved 'main_fac_page_3.html' file since it contains the November 2016 Featured Article log we need.",

    "description": "This code fixes the critical NameError bug from the previous execution by properly defining the 'page_text' variable before using it in content analysis. The implementation provides a comprehensive analysis of the collected Wikipedia data with multiple improvement layers: (1) First inspects the workspace inventory and JSON structure to understand available data, (2) Focuses on the most promising file 'main_fac_page_3.html' which contains the November 2016 Featured Article log with 452 November 2016 references, (3) Searches for dinosaur-related content using comprehensive keyword lists including scientific terms like 'paleontology', 'cretaceous', 'mesozoic', and specific dinosaur types, (4) Extracts contexts around dinosaur mentions to identify Featured Article nominations, (5) Looks for article links and nomination patterns that combine dinosaur content with November 2016 promotion dates, and (6) Re-analyzes the FAC archive file with the bug fix to ensure no content was missed. The code saves detailed analysis results and provides clear next steps based on whether dinosaur Featured Articles are found in the November 2016 data.",

The analysis discovered a dinosaur Featured Article: **Giganotosaurus** was nominated by **FunkMonk** on September 30, 2016, and underwent Featured Article Candidate review throughout October-November 2016. The code found 12 mentions of 'dinosaur' and 4 mentions of 'cretaceous' in the November 2016 Featured Article log, with detailed nomination contexts showing the complete FAC discussion. However, execution failed with another NameError ('article_lower' not defined) in the article links section, but this didn't prevent the core discovery. **PLAN alignment: 95% complete** - we found the dinosaur Featured Article (Giganotosaurus), the nominator (FunkMonk), and the November 2016 promotion timeframe. The detailed analysis results have been saved to 'detailed_analysis_results.json'. Only minor cleanup needed: fix the article_lower variable error, but the main objective is achieved.",

FunkMonk (talk) 17:38, 8 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nI haven\'t run into this before; I\'ll post on WT:FAC and try to get more opinions.  My feeling is that it\'s fine for a Wikipedian to make a picture, and it doesn\'t have to be considered original research, but it should be possible for a reader to understand where the picture came from and why it\'s reliable.  I don\'t think that\'s the case here.  Let\'s see what others say. Mike Christie (talk - contribs -  library) 10:18, 9 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nIt was discussed at length at the "no original research" talk page[24], with the consensus mentioned above. So feel free to start a new discussion, but please make clear that it has already been discussed with a favourable outcome, with emphasis on WP:OI and WP:PERTINENCE.

FunkMonk (talk) 10:35, 9 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nCan you use the pictures here to support the description?  The dune buggy shows up there a couple of times, and in at least one shot I can see tools. I know these are user-contributed pictures, but tripadvisor exercises editorial control over what gets displayed, so I think this would count as a reliable source. Mike Christie (talk - contribs -  library) 10:57, 9 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nIn that case, this[27] Tripadvisor review specifically states "El Buggy que utilizaba Ruben Carolini cuando encontró al Dinosaurio mas grande del mundo". So perhaps better than citing an image? FunkMonk (talk) 11:14, 9 November 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nYes, that\'s better; I think I\'d cite the image too, just to make sure nobody complains about the user-generated nature of the quote. Can\'t use that for the tools, though, but the buggy is the main point, since it was clearly set up to look like the discovery scene.
