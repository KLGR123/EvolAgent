## Final Answer
```
FunkMonk
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the nominator of the only dinosaur Featured Article promoted on English Wikipedia in November 2016. All three team members demonstrated excellent systematic approaches and reached identical conclusions through independent research methodologies. Member 1 used a two-phase approach: first identifying Giganotosaurus from the Wikipedia Featured Article log (finding promotion on November 19, 2016 by Ian Rose via FACBot), then tracing back to the original FAC nomination archive to identify FunkMonk as the nominator on September 30, 2016. Member 2 employed comprehensive archive analysis of the November 2016 FA log (2MB+ of data), systematically identifying Giganotosaurus through content analysis and confirming FunkMonk's nomination with detailed verification. Member 3 used targeted search methodology, successfully identifying Giganotosaurus as the sole dinosaur FA from November 2016, then accessing FAC archives to confirm FunkMonk's original nomination. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: all members independently identified (1) Giganotosaurus as the only dinosaur Featured Article promoted in November 2016, (2) November 19, 2016 as the specific promotion date, (3) FunkMonk as the original nominator on September 30, 2016. No contradictions exist between approaches - all three used rigorous Wikipedia archive analysis with proper source verification. Integration assessment: All members demonstrated strong research methodology, accessing official Wikipedia FAC archives and Featured Article logs. The unanimous identification of FunkMonk across three independent research approaches provides high confidence in accuracy. Final validation: Multiple verification points confirm FunkMonk submitted the Giganotosaurus nomination on September 30, 2016, leading to Featured Article promotion on November 19, 2016.
