# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for and access the Wikipedia pages for each day of August (August 1 through August 31) using the Wayback Machine to retrieve the specific versions from June 2023. Start with a systematic approach to locate these pages, such as 'August 1', 'August 2', etc., and extract the archived versions from late June 2023. For each page, analyze the references section and identify any citations that reference Twitter or X posts, counting the total number of such citations per page.

## Description
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to establish the scope by identifying all 31 Wikipedia pages for each day of August and accessing their June 2023 archived versions, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the archived Wikipedia pages and begin systematic analysis of Twitter/X citations in their reference sections, (4) This creates the foundation for comprehensive citation counting across all August day pages as they appeared in June 2023

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 4: Extract July 3 2023 LOTR Wikipedia Internal Links Toward A Song of Ice and Fire

**Description**: Access the archived Wikipedia page for 'The Lord of the Rings' (book) as it appeared at the end of July 3, 2023. Use the Wayback Machine or Wikipedia's revision history to retrieve the specific version from that date. Extract all outbound links from the page content, focusing on internal Wikipedia links that could potentially lead toward 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. Create a comprehensive list of linked pages including literature, fantasy, author, publisher, and genre-related links that might serve as stepping stones in the path-finding process.

**Use Cases**:
- Competitive product mapping for market intelligence teams: archive the Wikipedia page of a rival’s flagship product, extract outbound links, and use BFS to uncover related technologies and collaborators leading to a specific emerging competitor.
- Academic literature exploration for research librarians: retrieve an archived revision of a foundational theory page, scrape internal links, and trace a path through related journals and authors to locate a target contemporary study.
- SEO internal linking audit for digital marketing agencies: load a historical snapshot of a high-traffic Wikipedia article, extract its link network, and identify the shortest chain of links that leads to pages optimized for a target keyword.
- Educational curriculum design for e-learning platforms: access the archived “Introduction to Biology” page, gather its outbound topic links, and map a learning path toward advanced genetics content using breadth-first search.
- Historical content evolution analysis for digital archivists: pull the July 2023 version of a political event page, extract links, and reconstruct how references to a specific legislation article appeared over time by finding link paths.
- Knowledge graph augmentation for AI research teams: scrape a past revision of an ontology page, collect entity links, and build a linkage chain to a new domain-specific concept to enrich the graph with contextual relationships.
- Due diligence support for consulting firms: obtain an archived corporate biography page, scrape its network of partner and subsidiary links, and run BFS to identify the shortest route to a target industry regulation page.

### Development Step 10: Filter Wikipedia revision history to count page edits through June 30, 2023

**Description**: Filter the extracted revision data from the comprehensive Wikipedia history to count only the edits made from the page's inception until the end of June 2023. Exclude any revisions that occurred after June 30, 2023, and provide the exact count of edits within the specified timeframe.

**Use Cases**:
- Digital humanities research on cultural heritage: counting edits to historical monument Wikipedia pages through June 2023 to gauge community-driven documentation growth
- Political journalism analytics: measuring the volume of revisions on election-related articles up to June 2023 to identify periods of peak editorial activity
- Corporate brand compliance audit: auditing all edits on a company’s Wikipedia page until mid-2023 to verify no unauthorized content changes occurred
- Machine learning dataset preparation: filtering Wikipedia revision histories before July 2023 to build a time-bounded corpus for change-detection model training
- Educational content stability assessment: evaluating the number of edits on science and math topic pages until June 2023 to select stable resources for textbook references
- NGO transparency reporting: quantifying community edits on environmental policy articles through June 2023 to demonstrate stakeholder engagement over time
- SEO and digital marketing performance review: tracking cumulative edits on product and service Wikipedia pages before July 2023 to inform content strategy adjustments
- Fact-checking and misinformation studies: analyzing revision counts on high-profile news event pages up to June 2023 to correlate editorial activity with misinformation spikes

### Development Step 8: Count Wikipedia page edits from inception through June 30, 2023

**Description**: Filter the extracted revision data from the comprehensive Wikipedia history to count only the edits made from the page's inception until the end of June 2023. Exclude any revisions that occurred after June 30, 2023, and provide the exact count of edits within the specified timeframe.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical research in digital humanities: quantifying edit frequency of the “World War II” Wikipedia article from creation until June 30, 2023 to study shifts in collective memory
- Crisis communication analysis: counting revisions on the “COVID-19 pandemic” page up to June 2023 to correlate spikes in edits with major outbreak events
- Journalism data visualization: compiling the number of edits on the “United States presidential election” article before July 2023 to illustrate media attention cycles
- Machine learning dataset preparation: selecting only revisions made to the “Climate change” page until mid-2023 to train time-aware text generation models
- Corporate competitive intelligence: tracking edit counts on rival product pages (e.g., “iPhone”) up to June 2023 to gauge public information update frequency
- NGO impact assessment: measuring contribution activity on environmental initiative articles until June 2023 to identify key volunteer editors
- Legal e-discovery and audit: auditing revision counts for contentious biography pages to establish timelines of content changes before July 2023

### Development Step 9: Filter Wikipedia Revisions from Inception to June 30, 2023, and Count All Edits

**Description**: Filter the extracted revision data from the comprehensive Wikipedia history to count only the edits made from the page's inception until the end of June 2023. Exclude any revisions that occurred after June 30, 2023, and provide the exact count of edits within the specified timeframe.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical audit of a high-traffic political article to report the exact number of edits from its creation through June 30, 2023 for a government transparency review
- Legal compliance verification of a corporate product documentation page by counting all edits made before the July 2023 launch cutoff
- Academic analysis of contributor activity on the “Climate Change” Wikipedia entry up to June 30, 2023 to correlate edit bursts with major IPCC report releases
- Data journalism investigation tracking the volume of corrections on COVID-19–related pages from inception until mid-2023 to illustrate information stability
- Software documentation freeze monitoring by tallying updates to the “Docker” page before the June 2023 feature-freeze deadline for release planning
- Competitive market research quantifying revision counts on flagship smartphone pages through June 2023 to benchmark public interest trends
- Non-profit grant application support by auditing edits made to the NGO’s mission statement article up to June 2023 funding deadline

### Development Step 3: Wikipedia 'Dragon' Page: Leap Day (Feb 29, 2000 & 2004) Edits Removing Jokes or Humor Content

**Description**: Search for Wikipedia revision history of the 'Dragon' page to identify edits made on leap days (February 29) before 2008. Focus on February 29, 2000 and February 29, 2004 as the only leap days in that timeframe. Look for edit summaries or revision comparisons that mention joke removal, humor deletion, or similar content changes. Extract the specific revision data showing what content was removed on those dates.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical Wikipedia content auditing to verify removal of informal or humorous material for compliance with encyclopedic standards
- Academic research into the evolution of Wikipedia article tone and editorial practices over time
- Automated detection and documentation of joke or prank edits in high-profile Wikipedia pages for digital humanities studies
- Quality assurance for Wikipedia administrators seeking to identify and review non-encyclopedic content edits on significant dates (e.g., leap days, anniversaries)
- Training dataset generation for machine learning models that classify humorous versus formal content in collaborative knowledge bases
- Media fact-checking to trace the origin and removal of viral or meme-like phrases from public knowledge resources
- Educational curriculum development illustrating the importance of editorial oversight and tone in open-source encyclopedias
- Archival preservation projects aiming to document the cultural history of online communities through notable content changes
