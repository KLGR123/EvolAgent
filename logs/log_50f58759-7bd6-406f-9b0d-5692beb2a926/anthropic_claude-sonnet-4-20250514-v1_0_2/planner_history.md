    "plan": "Search for and access the archived Wikipedia pages for each day of August (August 1st through August 31st) as they appeared in June 2023. Use the Wayback Machine or Wikipedia's revision history to retrieve the specific versions from late June 2023. For each daily August page, extract all references and citations, then count how many of these references are Twitter/X posts (looking for URLs containing twitter.com, x.com, or t.co domains). Create a comprehensive analysis showing the count of Twitter/X citations for each August day's Wikipedia page.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to systematically access 31 different Wikipedia pages (August 1-31) from their June 2023 archived versions, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this specific citation analysis, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the archived content for all August daily pages and begin extracting Twitter/X reference counts, (4) This establishes the foundation for comprehensive citation analysis across all August days to answer the TASK's requirement for Twitter/X post citation frequency on each day's Wikipedia page",
