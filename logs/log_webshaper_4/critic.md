## Final Answer
```
Austria Wien 2-1 BFC Dynamo
```

## True Answer
```
BFC Dynamo lost 2-1
```

## Reasoning
```
Task decomposition: This complex question required identifying (1) the Berlin club that won the last East German Cup in 1984, (2) the Austrian club that faced a specific Maltese team, (3) the Maltese club that lost 0-8 to Rangers FC in Cup Winners' Cup, and (4) the final score of their October 2, 1985 match. Individual evaluation: All three members conducted systematic research but with varying accuracy on the core premise. Member 1 and Member 2 both correctly identified that NO Berlin club actually won the 1984 East German Cup - Dynamo Dresden won, with BFC Dynamo as runners-up. Member 3 also reached this same conclusion. All members correctly identified BFC Dynamo as the relevant Berlin club (1984 Cup finalist) and Austria Wien as their European opponent. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence: All members independently confirmed (1) BFC Dynamo reached the 1984 FDGB-Pokal final but lost to Dynamo Dresden, (2) Austria Wien was the Austrian club that faced BFC Dynamo in 1985-86 European Cup, (3) Valletta FC was the Maltese club that lost 0-8 to Rangers FC in Cup Winners' Cup, (4) The October 2, 1985 return leg final score was Austria Wien 2-1 BFC Dynamo. Methodological assessment: All members demonstrated thorough research capabilities with comprehensive web searches, proper source verification, and systematic documentation. Member 1 provided the most detailed match information including goalscorers (Nyilasi 60', Steinkogler 82' for Austria Wien; Schulz 90' for BFC Dynamo), attendance (9,500), and referee details. Synthesis validation: Multiple independent sources confirm Austria Wien defeated BFC Dynamo 2-1 in the European Cup first round return leg on October 2, 1985 at Gerhard Hanappi Stadion in Vienna. The aggregate score was 4-1 to Austria Wien. All complex cross-references in the question were properly resolved through systematic identification of the interconnected clubs and competitions.
