### Title:  
Calculate % Difference from US Standard Butterfat in Ice Cream Using 2020 Wikipedia Data

**TASK**: If this whole pint is made up of ice cream, how many percent above or below the US federal standards for butterfat content is it when using the standards as reported by Wikipedia in 2020? Answer as + or - a number rounded to one decimal place. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/b2c257e0-3ad7-4f05-b8e3-d9da973be36e.jpg

The corrected analysis properly distinguished between international standards and US-specific federal regulations.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Wikipedia Analysis**: Retrieved and analyzed the complete Wikipedia Ice cream article (46,794 characters) using both API access and HTML scraping to ensure complete content coverage.\n\n4. **Regulatory Authority Confirmed**: Identified the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) as the regulatory authority establishing these federal standards for ice cream classification in the United States.\n\n5. **Strong Supporting Evidence**: Found multiple supporting sentences from Wikipedia, including:\n   - "In the US, the FDA rules state that to be described as \'ice cream\', a product must have the following composition: greater than 10% milk fat"\n   - "American federal labelling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 10% milk fat"\n\n6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: All analysis results, corrections, and supporting evidence have been saved to workspace files:\n   - `us_federal_ice_cream_butterfat_standard_corrected.json` (final corrected results)\n   - `wikipedia_ice_cream_html_scraped.txt` (complete Wikipedia content)\n   - Multiple intermediate analysis files for reference\n\n**Final Result**: The US federal minimum butterfat content for ice cream is **10%**, as established by FDA regulations and reported by Wikipedia based on 2020 information.
