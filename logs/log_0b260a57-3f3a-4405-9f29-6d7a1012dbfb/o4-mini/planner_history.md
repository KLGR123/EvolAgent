    "plan": 'Navigate to the ScienceDirect website, select the Life Sciences subject area, apply the content‐type filter for “Reference Works,” then record the number of Reference Works displayed for each Life Sciences sub‐category and save these counts in workspace/life_sciences_reference_counts.csv.',
    "description": 'This step is required to gather the raw counts of Reference Works for each Life Sciences sub‐category on ScienceDirect as of 2022. These counts form the data set needed to compute the sample standard deviation for Life Sciences. Once collected, these values will enable us to calculate the Life Sciences sample standard deviation and later compare it against the Health Sciences sample standard deviation to determine their difference.',
