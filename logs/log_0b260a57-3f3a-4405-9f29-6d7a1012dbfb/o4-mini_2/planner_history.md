{
    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": 'Access ScienceDirect Advanced Search at https://www.sciencedirect.com/advanced-search, set Document Type filter to ‘Reference Works’ and Publication Year filter to ‘2022’, then capture the Subject-Area facet counts for every entry listed under the ‘Life Sciences’ category and for every entry listed under the ‘Health Sciences’ category; save those counts in workspace/life_health_reference_counts.json.',
    "description": 'This step gathers the raw counts of Reference Works in each sub-subject of Life Sciences and Health Sciences for 2022 directly from ScienceDirect. Those counts are the data points needed to compute each category’s sample standard deviation and then determine the difference between the Life Science domains and Health Sciences. No prior data exists, so this establishes the foundation for all subsequent statistical calculations.',
