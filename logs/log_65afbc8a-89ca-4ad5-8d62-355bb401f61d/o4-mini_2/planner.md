## Task Description
```
You are given this Excel file as a map. You start on the START cell and move toward the END cell. You are allowed to move two cells per turn, and you may move up, down, left, or right. You may not move fewer than two cells, and you may not move backward. You must avoid moving onto any blue cells. On the eleventh turn, what is the 6-digit hex code (without prefix) of the color of the cell where you land after moving?

### Compute odds of today’s Sunset Picnic Trip using a steam locomotive

**TASK**: The attached file lists the locomotives owned by a local railroad museum. It gives each locomotive’s identifying number, operating status, and the name of the daily excursion it heads, if operational.
