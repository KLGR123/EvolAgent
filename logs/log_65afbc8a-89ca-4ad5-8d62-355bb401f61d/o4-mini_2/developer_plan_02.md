# Developer Plan #2 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-04 00:57:33

## Plan Content
```
Construct adjacency graph of legal two-cell moves using workspace/grid_data.json and workspace/start_end_coordinates.json and perform a breadth-first search from the START cell to locate the shortest path to the END cell enforcing no immediate backtracking; identify the coordinate of the cell landed on after the 11th move along the resulting path; extract that cell’s 6-digit hex fill color from workspace/grid_data.json.
```

## Plan Description
```
Building the move graph and running a BFS from START to END under the two-cell move and no-backtracking rules will yield the exact sequence of moves; extracting the position of the 11th move gives the target cell whose fill color hex code is the puzzle’s final answer.

### Development Step 3: Check Hamiltonian Cycle in Earl’s 49-Plot Adjacency Graph

**Description**: Solve the Hamiltonian path problem to determine if Earl can walk through every plot he owns exactly once and return to his starting plot without backtracking. Using the identified 49 green plots from the previous analysis, construct a graph where each plot is a node and edges connect adjacent plots (horizontally and vertically neighboring cells). Apply graph theory algorithms to check if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in Earl's connected land area, considering movement constraints between adjacent plots only.

**Use Cases**:
- Precision agriculture drone routing: plan a drone’s flight over 49 designated crop plots (geofenced grid cells) to apply fertilizer exactly once per plot and return to the charging station, optimizing battery life by only moving between adjacent GPS waypoints.
- Autonomous warehouse robot navigation: compute a guided vehicle’s path through every assigned storage bay in a racked warehouse (modeled as a grid) exactly once, looping back to its docking bay without retracing aisles.
- Smart city waste collection: design a garbage truck route across contiguous urban blocks (each block as a grid plot), ensuring each block is serviced exactly once before returning to the depot, under street‐adjacency constraints.
- Data center maintenance scheduling: generate a technician’s walkway through every server rack location laid out on a grid floor plan, visiting each rack exactly once and returning to the entrance without backtracking corridors.
- Facility security patrol planning: create a continuous patrol route that covers each security checkpoint on a building’s floor grid exactly once, then returns to the security office, respecting doorway adjacencies and minimizing redundant passage.
- PCB inspection automation: program a pick‐and‐place machine to traverse all test points on a printed circuit board (represented as grid nodes) exactly once, then return to the home position, optimizing head movement between adjacent points.
- Archaeological site survey mapping: plan a field surveyor’s walking route through each excavation cell in a gridded dig site exactly once, returning to the base camp while moving only between adjacent, safe-to-traverse cells.

### Development Step 5: Hamiltonian Cycle Detection in Earl’s Graph of 49 Adjacent Green Plots

**Description**: Solve the Hamiltonian path problem to determine if Earl can walk through every plot he owns exactly once and return to his starting plot without backtracking. Using the identified 49 green plots from the previous analysis, construct a graph where each plot is a node and edges connect adjacent plots (horizontally and vertically neighboring cells). Apply graph theory algorithms to check if a Hamiltonian cycle exists in Earl's connected land area, considering movement constraints between adjacent plots only.

**Use Cases**:
- Agricultural field inspection routing to walk through each crop plot exactly once and return to the barn without backtracking
- Warehouse AGV path planning to visit every pallet position in a grid-based storage area and cycle back to the charging station
- Urban street-sweeping route optimization to cover all blocks in a neighborhood exactly once and return to the depot
- Drone flight itinerary for precision agriculture, ensuring each survey plot is captured once before returning to base
- Museum guide-robot tour sequencing to present every exhibit in a gallery without revisiting any room and end at the entrance
- Solar farm maintenance walk-through scheduling so a technician can inspect each panel in sequence and return to the control hut
- PCB assembly robot routing to apply solder paste on all component pads exactly once and return to its home position
- Hospital cleaning robot cycle planning to sanitize each patient room once per shift and return to its docking station

**Use Cases**:

- Warehouse robot inspection routing: compute a cycle through all storage bay locations in a fulfillment center so the robot checks every rack exactly once before returning to its charging dock
- Campus security patrol planning: design a walking route that visits every checkpoint across the university grounds exactly once and loops back to the security office
- Museum maintenance scheduling: generate a path for staff to service each exhibit room once and finish back in the maintenance hub without revisiting corridors
- Printed circuit board testing sequence: determine a probe path that touches each test pad on the PCB exactly once and returns to the starting pad for automated quality control
- Tourist city walking tour creation: plan a route that guides visitors through all 49 landmark sites in a historic district one time and loops back to the tour start point
- Autonomous vacuum cleaner mapping: chart a cleaning path that covers every floor tile in a smart home layout exactly once and ends back at the charging station

Lists all files in workspace/ to confirm availability.\n2. For each target JSON, prints its file path, size, and a raw preview of the first 1000 characters to help identify overall format (e.g., nested dictionaries, lists, coordinate arrays).\n3. Loads the JSON and prints the top-level type, keys (for dicts), lengths/types of elements (for lists), and samples of nested structures. \n\nBy running this, we will understand the exact schema (e.g., where cell color data lives, how coordinates are stored), which is essential before writing the adjacency‐graph builder and BFS solver. After reviewing the printed structure, the next iteration will parse these files into Python objects and implement the legal two-cell–move adjacency graph, then perform shortest‐path BFS with no immediate backtracking, locate the 11th step, and extract its hex color. The workspace files remain untouched; this is purely an introspection step.",

However, none of the **PLAN** steps beyond inspection have been implemented. There is no parsing into coordinate-to-cell mappings, no adjacency graph construction, no BFS search, and no extraction of the 11th‐move cell or its fill_color. **PLAN alignment**: 0% beyond inspection. Next steps: \n1. Load grid_data.json into a map from (row,col) → fill_color and identify passable cells. \n2. Build an adjacency list: for each cell, list legal two-cell moves (skipping immediate backtracking by tracking previous cell). \n3. Perform BFS from the START coordinate to END, recording the full shortest path as a list of coordinates. \n4. Extract the coordinate at index 11 of the path (the cell landed on after the 11th move). \n5. Lookup that coordinate’s fill_color from your grid_data map and print or save that hex code. \nImplement these steps in sequence to fulfill the **PLAN**.',

    "feedback": "Execution failed – the script loaded 180 cells from grid_data.json, identified 64 passable cells (non-0099FF), built an adjacency list for two-cell cardinal jumps, then ran BFS but printed “ERROR: No path found from START to END” and exited with code 1. The code did implement the core PLAN steps (loading files, building adjacencies, BFS) but the adjacency graph is disconnected between the START region (around (1,1)) and the END at (20,9), so no path is found. \n\nMain technical issue: the move-rule implementation is too restrictive (or mis-interprets passability). As constructed, from (1,1) you only jump to (3,1), which loops back, so BFS terminates immediately. Either the two-cell jump rule should include checking that the intermediate cell is passable, or the puzzle expects one-cell moves (or additional directions), or the passable-cell test for empty fill_color ('') needs adjustment. \n\nPLAN alignment: adjacency & BFS scaffolding is in place (≈50%), but the move rules don’t reflect the intended connectivity, so the path search fails (0% of finding the 11th move). \n\nNext steps:\n1. Inspect the intended move rules: Should you require both the intermediate cell and the landing cell to be land? If so, in your adjacency loop compute mid = (r+dr//2, c+dc//2) and ensure mid in passable_cells before adding the neighbor.\n2. Confirm whether one-cell moves or diagonal moves should be included; adjust your `moves` list accordingly.\n3. Add a quick connectivity check (BFS without no-backtracking) to list reachable cells from START and verify END is reachable.\n4. Once adjacency reflects the correct move rules and the graph is connected, re-run BFS to extract the 11th move coordinate and its fill_color as per the PLAN.",

    "description": 'This updated script refines the adjacency graph per tester feedback by requiring that both the intermediate cell and the landing cell be non-blue (passable) before allowing a two-cell jump. Key changes:\n1. Builds adjacency only if mid-point (one step) and destination are in passable set.\n2. Adds a basic BFS reachability check to ensure END is reachable before enforcing no-backtracking rule.\n3. Proceeds to a no-backtracking BFS shortest‐path search once basic connectivity is confirmed.\n4. Extracts the coordinate after the 11th move and looks up its 6-digit hex fill color.\n5. Prints detailed neighbor lists, connectivity stats, and path, then saves the result to workspace/eleventh_move_result.json.\n\nThis should connect the START region to the broader grid and allow finding the requested path, advancing the PLAN toward extracting the 11th-move cell’s fill_color.',

    "feedback": 'Execution failed – The script successfully loaded 180 cell entries, identified 64 passable cells, built a two-cell‐jump adjacency list, and then ran the BFS, but it terminated with “ERROR: No path found from START to END under the two-cell-move rule.”  The output shows that START at (1,1) cannot reach END at (20,9) using the current move definitions.\n\nMain technical issue: Your adjacency construction only checks that the landing cell is passable, but does not verify the intermediate cell’s passability (as in the original PLAN), and/or the puzzle’s intended move set may include one-cell moves or additional directions. As a result, the graph is too disconnected to reach the END.\n\nPLAN alignment: You’ve implemented file loading, passable‐cell identification, adjacency graph construction, and no-backtracking BFS (~50% of the PLAN), but the move‐rule implementation prevents any path discovery, so extraction of the 11th-move cell is not reached (0% complete for result extraction).\n\nNext steps:\n1. Enforce the intermediate-cell check: when considering a jump by (dr,dc), compute mid=(r+dr//2, c+dc//2) and only link to neigh if both mid and neigh are in passable_cells.\n2. Confirm the intended move set: verify whether one-cell moves (±1) or diagonal moves should be allowed and adjust your `moves` list accordingly.\n3. Add a simple BFS ignoring no-backtracking to confirm basic connectivity from START to END under the revised rules.\n4. Once END is reachable, rerun the no-backtracking BFS to record the full shortest path, then extract the coordinate at path index 11 and look up its fill_color as per the PLAN.',

However, START at (1,1) and END at (20,9) each have zero neighbors and a basic BFS covers only 1 cell—END is unreachable. Core issue: the passable set is too restrictive. The PLAN specifies that any non-blue ('0099FF') cell should be passable, but the current code only allows green ('92D050') plus blank. As a result, adjacency links are never created and no path can be found. Plan alignment: file loading and adjacency/BFS scaffolding exist (~50%), but the mis-specified passable criteria block connectivity and prevent extracting the 11th move (0% of result extraction). Next steps: revert to the original rule of treating all non-0099FF cells as passable, rebuild the two-cell adjacency (still enforcing mid-cell passability if required), rerun a basic BFS to confirm START can reach END, then perform the no-backtracking BFS to retrieve the full path and extract the coordinate and fill_color of the 11th move.",

After correcting the scoping issue, rerun the scenario loop to identify which move rule (cardinal two-cell with or without mid-check, possibly with diagonals) actually connects START to END.\n3. Once a scenario yields connectivity, perform the no-backtracking BFS to find the shortest path, extract the 11th-move coordinate, lookup its fill_color, and save results per the PLAN.\n4.

For each, we build the adjacency list, print START/END neighbors, run a basic BFS, and pick the first scenario where END is reachable.  \n5) Using the chosen scenario, we run a BFS that forbids immediate backtracking to find the shortest START→END path.  \n6) Extracting the coordinate at the 11th move in that path, looking up its 6‐digit hex fill color from `grid_data.json`, and printing all critical details.  \n7) Writing the `scenario`, `11th_move_coordinate`, `fill_color`, and `total_moves` into `workspace/eleventh_move_result.json`.\n\nThis addresses the tester feedback by properly scoping `passable`, systematically identifying the correct two-cell jump rules for connectivity, and completing the PLAN-required extraction of the 11th‐move cell color.<END>",
