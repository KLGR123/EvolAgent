## Final Answer
```
Berkshire
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the typical American name for the locomotive type used by the railroad museum for their Murder Mystery Express service, requiring Excel file analysis and locomotive classification knowledge. All three team members demonstrated exemplary analytical rigor and reached identical conclusions through systematic approaches. Member evaluation: (1) Member 1 successfully parsed the Excel file, identified locomotive #266 as assigned to Murder Mystery Express, determined its 2-8-4 wheel configuration, and correctly classified it as a 'Berkshire' type with comprehensive historical context including its 1925 Boston & Albany Railroad origins. (2) Member 2 employed identical methodology with equally thorough analysis, proper data cleaning to remove category headers, and accurate mapping of the 2-8-4 wheel arrangement to 'Berkshire' classification. (3) Member 3 followed the same systematic approach, successfully completing all analytical steps and providing additional technical details about the locomotive's historical usage in mainline passenger and freight service. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: All members identified locomotive #266, confirmed its 2-8-4 wheel configuration, and unanimously determined 'Berkshire' as the correct American locomotive type name. No contradictions or divergences detected. Integration assessment: The consistent methodology across all members (Excel parsing → locomotive identification → wheel configuration analysis → American type classification) demonstrates robust analytical framework. All members provided complementary historical context validating the Berkshire designation. Final validation: Multiple independent analyses confirming locomotive #266 with 2-8-4 configuration assigned to Murder Mystery Express, with unanimous 'Berkshire' classification supported by comprehensive locomotive type knowledge. Confidence level: maximum.
