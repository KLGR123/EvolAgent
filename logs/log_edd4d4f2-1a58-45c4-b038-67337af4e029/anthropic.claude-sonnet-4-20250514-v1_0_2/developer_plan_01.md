## Plan Content
```
Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/edd4d4f2-1a58-45c4-b038-67337af4e029.xlsx to extract the complete locomotive inventory data from the local railroad museum. Identify the locomotive assigned to the 'Murder Mystery Express' service, then determine its type or classification to provide the typical American name for that locomotive type.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the Excel file structure and extract all locomotive data to identify which locomotive serves the Murder Mystery Express, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete locomotive inventory with service assignments and locomotive type classifications identified, (4) This provides the foundation needed to determine the specific locomotive type used for the Murder Mystery Express and provide its typical American name as requested in the TASK

### Development Step 1: Extract Locomotive Info from Excel: Sunset Picnic Trip Steam vs Other Probability Odds

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/4d0aa727-86b1-406b-9b33-f870dd14a4a5.xlsx to extract locomotive data including identifying numbers, operating status, and assigned daily excursions. Specifically identify all locomotives assigned to the 'Sunset Picnic Trip' and determine how many are steam locomotives versus other types to calculate the probability odds.

**Use Cases**:
- Railway excursion scheduling and resource optimization for heritage lines, determining how many steam engines versus diesel are assigned to the Sunset Picnic Trip each day
- Heritage tourism capacity planning and passenger experience forecasting by calculating the odds of a steam locomotive powering the Sunset Picnic Trip
- Safety compliance auditing and operational reporting for special event rail services, automatically flagging any excursions lacking required steam-engine assignments
- Predictive maintenance scheduling for locomotive fleets, prioritizing steam engines based on their frequency of assignment to high-visibility trips like the Sunset Picnic Trip
- Insurance risk modeling and premium calculation for scenic rail excursions by analyzing probabilities of steam versus non-steam locomotive deployment
- Academic transportation research on historical locomotive utilization, conducting statistical comparisons of steam and diesel assignments extracted from operational Excel logs
- Real-time dashboard automation for excursion managers, integrating locomotive status and Sunset Picnic Trip assignment odds into daily reporting tools
- Operational cost analysis and budget forecasting for railway heritage operations, comparing maintenance and fuel expenses between steam and other locomotive types on key excursions

### Development Step 2: Extract locomotive details and calculate steam vs non-steam odds for Sunset Picnic Trip

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/4d0aa727-86b1-406b-9b33-f870dd14a4a5.xlsx to extract locomotive data including identifying numbers, operating status, and assigned daily excursions. Specifically identify all locomotives assigned to the 'Sunset Picnic Trip' and determine how many are steam locomotives versus other types to calculate the probability odds.

**Use Cases**:
- Heritage railway event planning: automatically identify which steam locomotives are assigned to the upcoming “Sunset Picnic Trip” and calculate the odds of running a steam engine versus diesel to optimize marketing materials.
- Tourist excursion operations: integrate daily assignment data to determine locomotive type distribution on scenic trips and adjust staffing levels for boiler tenders versus diesel mechanics.
- Maintenance scheduling automation: parse weekly Excel rosters to flag steam engines on high-profile excursions, calculate their usage probability, and prioritize preventive maintenance windows.
- Safety compliance reporting: filter out locomotives operating on specific passenger routes, classify them by steam or diesel, and generate probability-based risk summaries for regulatory submissions.
- Historical performance research: extract assignment patterns for nostalgic steam excursions from archival spreadsheets, quantify steam-versus-diesel frequency, and support academic studies on heritage railway trends.
- Asset allocation optimization: analyze Excel-based locomotive rosters to compute odds of steam deployment on themed trips, informing fuel stock purchasing decisions and crew training allocations.
- Real-time excursion monitoring: automate ingestion of daily assignment sheets to classify locomotives by type, calculate steam-to-diesel ratios on special trips, and feed live dashboards for operations control.
- Financial forecasting for excursion tours: use historical locomotive assignment and type-probability data to predict operating costs on future “Sunset Picnic Trip” runs, factoring in steam fuel and maintenance overhead.

### Development Step 1: Parse Excel to Identify Steam Locomotives in North American Railroad Museum and Calculate Total Wheels

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx to extract locomotive data from the North American railroad museum collection. Identify all steam locomotives in the collection by examining locomotive types, wheel configurations, or other identifying characteristics, then calculate the total number of wheels for all steam locomotives listed.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum collection inventory automation for the North American Railroad Museum, extracting steam locomotive types and calculating total wheel counts to streamline maintenance schedules
- Historical research data extraction for mechanical engineering theses, analyzing wheel configurations of 19th-century steam engines from archival Excel records
- Digital exhibit content generation for a virtual railway tour app, transforming locomotive specifications and wheel arrangements into interactive user interfaces
- Restoration project planning for heritage railway societies, using aggregated wheel counts and configuration data to estimate material needs and labor costs
- Grant proposal preparation and KPI reporting for museum curators, leveraging steam locomotive prevalence and wheel-count metrics to support funding requests
- University data science coursework on real-world Excel parsing, teaching students to identify steam locomotives and compute total wheels using openpyxl and pandas
- Archival metadata ingestion for library and museum catalogs, automating extraction of locomotive builder, class, and wheel configuration details into digital repositories
- Performance benchmarking of Python Excel-processing workflows in industrial heritage analysis, comparing data-only loads and regex searches on locomotive collections

    "description": "This is the initial examination phase where I'm analyzing the Excel file structure to understand the locomotive inventory data format. I'm examining both the raw Excel structure using openpyxl and the parsed data using pandas to identify: (1) Column headers and data organization, (2) Location of 'Murder Mystery Express' service assignments, (3) Locomotive identification and type/classification columns, (4) Overall data structure and content patterns. This comprehensive analysis will help me locate the specific locomotive assigned to the Murder Mystery Express and determine its type for the typical American locomotive name classification.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully parsed the Excel file containing the railroad museum locomotive inventory. The analysis clearly identified the locomotive assigned to the 'Murder Mystery Express' service: locomotive number 266 with wheel configuration '2-8-4'. The code found exactly what was needed in Row 7/index 7 of the data. However, the **PLAN** requires one additional step that wasn't completed - determining the typical American name for the 2-8-4 locomotive type. The current output shows the technical wheel configuration but doesn't provide the common American classification name (which would be 'Berkshire'). **PLAN** alignment: 90% complete. Next step: Add logic to map the wheel configuration '2-8-4' to its typical American locomotive type name to fully answer the question.",

Based on the previous analysis, I know locomotive #266 with wheel configuration '2-8-4' is assigned to the Murder Mystery Express. Now I'm: (1) Loading and cleaning the locomotive inventory data, (2) Filtering for the Murder Mystery Express assignment, (3) Extracting the locomotive's wheel configuration (2-8-4), (4) Using a comprehensive dictionary of American locomotive wheel arrangements to map '2-8-4' to its typical American name 'Berkshire', (5) Providing additional context about the Berkshire locomotive type, and (6) Saving the complete analysis results. This fully addresses the PLAN requirement to identify the locomotive and provide its typical American classification name.",
