The HISTORY shows that the code executed perfectly and definitively identified Gustave Eiffel as the engineer who designed the lock system for the French Panama Canal project that was abandoned in 1889. The research provided comprehensive evidence including:\n\n1. **Primary Answer Confirmed**: Gustave Eiffel designed the lock system for the abandoned 1880s Panama Canal project\n2. **Timeline Verified**: Eiffel was contracted around 1887-1888 when the project shifted from sea-level to lock-based design\n3. **Search Verification**: 24 relevant search results confirmed the findings with specific evidence like 'Work on the lock canal started on January 15, 1888. Gustave Eiffel, builder of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, would construct the canal locks' and 'In 1887 Eiffel agreed to build the locks of the Panama canal'\n4. **Historical Context**: The research provided complete context about the French Panama Canal project (1881-1889) led by Ferdinand de Lesseps, the design evolution from sea-level to locks, and Eiffel's specific role\n5. **Data Preservation**: All research findings were properly saved to workspace files (panama_canal_lock_designer_research.json and panama_canal_search_results.json)\n\nThe tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with the feedback: 'Code ran without errors and completely fulfilled the **PLAN** requirements... the specific engineer who designed the lock system has been definitively identified with supporting evidence. No further development is needed.'\n\nThe research question has been thoroughly answered with historical accuracy and supporting evidence. The task is complete.",
