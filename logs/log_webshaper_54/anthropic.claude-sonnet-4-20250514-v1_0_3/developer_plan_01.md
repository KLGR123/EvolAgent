**Task ID:** webshaper_54  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-12 03:46:44

## Plan Content
```
Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify Superfund sites in Montana that were formerly part of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. Focus on finding which specific city in Montana contains such a Superfund site. Search for keywords including 'Montana Superfund sites Anaconda Copper Mining Company', 'Anaconda Copper Company contaminated sites Montana cities', 'EPA Superfund Montana mining contamination', and 'former Anaconda Copper operations Montana locations'. Extract the city names and details about the Superfund designation to identify the target location.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific Montana city that contains a Superfund site with Anaconda Copper Mining Company history, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the Montana city that will serve as the foundation for finding the baseball team, (4) This directly addresses the first requirement in the complex multi-part TASK before we can trace the collegiate summer baseball league and team information

### Development Step 1: 2011 Nickel, Cobalt, PGM Recovery from Automotive Catalysts via Lithium-Calcination and Bioleaching

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify academic works, technical publications, or books from 2011 that cover hydrometallurgical processes for recovering nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals from spent automotive catalysts. Focus on searching for keywords including '2011 nickel cobalt platinum recovery automotive catalysts', 'calcination lithium salts metal recovery 2011', 'Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bioleaching cobalt 2011', 'two-stage bioleaching low-grade cobalt ores', and 'spent catalyst metal recovery 2011 publisher'. Look for technical books, conference proceedings, journal special issues, or industry publications that detail both the calcination process with lithium salts and the specific bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for cobalt ore processing.

**Use Cases**:
- Mining R&D team conducting a patent and literature landscape analysis on 2011 hydrometallurgical methods for nickel, cobalt, and platinum recovery to inform the development of a new recycling process.
- Environmental consultancy compiling case studies on Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bioleaching from 2011 publications to evaluate bioremediation strategies for heavy-metal-contaminated soils near automotive dismantling sites.
- Academic librarian curating a graduate-level syllabus on advanced metal recovery techniques, ensuring all seminal 2011 works on calcination with lithium salts and bioleaching are included for materials science students.
- Government regulatory body auditing an industrial catalyst recycling facility‚Äôs compliance by cross-referencing 2011 technical standards and industry publications on spent automotive catalyst metal recovery.
- Battery manufacturer‚Äôs supply-chain sustainability group examining 2011 hydrometallurgical research to identify proven cobalt-recycling routes and integrate closed-loop recovery into their production line.
- Scientific publisher scouting high-impact 2011 conference proceedings and special journal issues on platinum-group metal recovery to plan a retrospective special edition on recycling technologies.
- Materials engineering consultancy performing competitive intelligence on two-stage bioleaching and lithium-salt calcination processes by extracting 2011 technical book and journal references to advise clients.
- Industrial equipment supplier researching historical implementations from 2011 of bioleaching reactors and calcination systems in automotive catalyst recycling plants to tailor new process-automation solutions.

### Development Step 3: Confirm 2011 Extractive Metallurgy of Ni, Co, PGM Includes Lithium Calcination and Two-Stage Bioleaching

**Description**: Verify the identified 2011 Elsevier publication 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by conducting a targeted search to confirm it specifically covers both the calcination process with lithium salts for recovering metals from spent automotive catalysts AND the two-stage bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for low-grade cobalt ores. Search for the book's table of contents, chapter summaries, or detailed reviews that explicitly mention these two specific processes. Cross-reference with academic databases, publisher catalogs, and technical literature citations to ensure this publication contains both required methodologies described in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Patent due diligence for materials science: verifying that a 2022 WO patent application covers both reinforced polymer composites and flame-retardant additive processing steps by targeted SerpAPI queries to patent office and scholarly sources
- Pharmaceutical guideline confirmation: ensuring the 2020 WHO monograph explicitly includes renal dosage adjustment protocols and adverse reaction monitoring procedures by searching chapter summaries and section titles
- Automotive supplier audit: confirming an ISO/TS 16949 supplier manual online covers both heat-treatment procedures for chassis parts and corrosion-resistance testing protocols using focused Google searches
- Open-source software compliance check: verifying that a cryptography library‚Äôs documentation details both RSA key generation methods and AES-GCM encryption usage via structured search queries on GitHub Pages and developer blogs
- Market intelligence white-paper analysis: ensuring a competitor‚Äôs 2021 market study contains consumer behavior segmentation for North America and side-by-side feature comparisons with key rivals by scanning executive summaries and table of contents
- Academic textbook syllabus alignment: confirming a 2023 engineering thermodynamics textbook includes both entropy analysis chapters and exergy efficiency case studies as mandated by a university course outline
- GDPR compliance verification: checking that the EU‚Äôs official GDPR guidelines PDF addresses both data subject access rights and data breach notification requirements by targeted searches of section headings and legal commentary
- Environmental impact report validation: verifying that a 2019 EPA assessment document covers both greenhouse gas emission quantification methods and carbon capture technology evaluations through focused online catalog and summary searches

### Development Step 6: Verify 2011 Extractive Metallurgy Book Covers Lithium-Salt Calcination and Two-Stage Bioleaching Methods

**Description**: Verify the identified 2011 Elsevier publication 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by conducting a targeted search to confirm it specifically covers both the calcination process with lithium salts for recovering metals from spent automotive catalysts AND the two-stage bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for low-grade cobalt ores. Search for the book's table of contents, chapter summaries, or detailed reviews that explicitly mention these two specific processes. Cross-reference with academic databases, publisher catalogs, and technical literature citations to ensure this publication contains both required methodologies described in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Patent prior-art verification and targeted confirmation of lithium-salt calcination and bioleaching methods in chemical patent examinations
- Battery recycling R&D literature validation and extraction of calcination with lithium salts for spent automotive catalyst recovery processes
- Metallurgical process adoption risk assessment and cross-referencing of two-stage Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bioleaching protocols in industrial scale-up proposals
- Academic grant proposal due diligence with automated searches to confirm cited Elsevier references include both nickel‚Äìcobalt recovery techniques
- Environmental consultancy remediation planning and auditing of published process descriptions for spent catalyst treatment and cobalt ore leaching
- University thesis committee automated reference auditing to ensure textbooks cited in graduate research actually cover specified calcination and bioleaching methods
- Systematic review authors‚Äô bibliometric analysis and methodology mapping of extractive metallurgy approaches across multiple academic and publisher catalogs

Despite the error, the code achieved the core **PLAN** objective by identifying the target city: **Anaconda, Montana** contains the Anaconda Co. Smelter Superfund site (EPA ID: 0800403) that was formerly part of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. The search found 140 total results with 126 mentioning Montana cities, and successfully saved comprehensive data to 'workspace_webshaper_54/montana_superfund_anaconda_search_results_20250812_034817.json'. The output clearly shows Anaconda as the primary city with multiple EPA references confirming it's on the National Priorities List since 1983. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - the main research objective is fulfilled. The minor variable error at the end doesn't affect the core findings. No further development needed for the primary research goal, though the final analysis code could be fixed if detailed government source analysis is required.",

    "description": 'Implementation of comprehensive analysis of the Montana Superfund search results to identify the specific city containing a Superfund site formerly part of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. This code first inspects the structure of the saved JSON search results file, then systematically analyzes all search data to extract Montana cities mentioned, Superfund site references, and Anaconda Copper Mining Company connections. The analysis categorizes results by city, identifies sites with both Superfund and Anaconda Copper connections, and determines the primary target city based on evidence strength. The code provides detailed output showing city-specific mentions, Superfund site details including EPA site IDs, and creates a comprehensive summary report. The final output clearly identifies Anaconda, Montana as the target city containing the Anaconda Co. Smelter Superfund site (EPA ID: 0800403) that was formerly part of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company operations and was listed on the National Priorities List in 1983.',

Based on the extensive search results from 10 targeted queries using SerpAPI, the specific city in Montana that contains a Superfund site formerly part of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company is **ANACONDA, MONTANA**. Key findings: (1) The Anaconda Co. Smelter Superfund site (EPA ID: 0800403) is located in Anaconda, Montana, (2) This site was formerly part of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company operations, (3) The site was placed on the EPA National Priorities List in September 1983, (4) The contamination resulted from over a century of milling and smelting operations producing high concentrations of arsenic, lead, copper, cadmium, and zinc, (5) The search yielded 140 total results with 126 specifically mentioning Montana cities, with Anaconda being the most frequently referenced city in connection with both Superfund designation and Anaconda Copper Mining Company operations. The comprehensive search data has been saved to 'workspace/montana_superfund_anaconda_search_results_20250812_034817.json' for reference.
