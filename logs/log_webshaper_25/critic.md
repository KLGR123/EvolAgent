## Reasoning

Task analysis: Identify the nationality of the person who served as Postmaster General and introduced scheduled postal delivery times on turnpike roads. Member evaluation reveals significant divergence requiring careful analysis: Member 1 conducted systematic research identifying John Palmer as the key figure who introduced scheduled postal delivery on British turnpike roads starting August 2, 1784, concluding his nationality as British. Member 2 focused on American postal history, identifying Benjamin Franklin as a Postmaster General who improved postal systems, concluding American nationality. Member 3 also identified John Palmer through comprehensive historical research, confirming his role in introducing the 1784 mail coach system with scheduled delivery times on England's turnpike network, concluding British nationality. Cross-analysis shows Members 1 and 3 converged on John Palmer with consistent historical evidence: (1) Palmer introduced the revolutionary mail coach system in 1784, (2) This system first implemented scheduled delivery times with published timetables, (3) It specifically operated on British turnpike roads, (4) Palmer worked with British postal authorities to reform the system. Member 2's focus on Benjamin Franklin, while historically accurate regarding his postal contributions, does not align with the specific criteria of 'first implemented scheduled delivery times and operated on turnpike roads' - Franklin's innovations preceded the systematic scheduled delivery and turnpike road integration that Palmer pioneered. Integration assessment: The convergence of Members 1 and 3 on John Palmer, supported by specific historical evidence of his 1784 innovations, provides higher confidence than Member 2's divergent conclusion. Final validation confirms John Palmer as the definitive answer based on his documented role in introducing the first scheduled postal delivery system operating on turnpike roads.
