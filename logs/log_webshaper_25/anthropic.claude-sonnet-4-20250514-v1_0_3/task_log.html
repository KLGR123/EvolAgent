Based on the comprehensive research conducted in the HISTORY, the person who provided testimony that helped convict both gang leaders has been definitively identified. Ed Shouse, a former gang member who turned state&#x27;s evidence, provided crucial testimony that convicted: (1) Harry Pierpont, leader of the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang (which committed bank robberies including their first major heist in Indiana in 1924 and the 1934 bank robbery that was John Dillinger&#x27;s last robbery involving a black Hudson getaway car), and (2) other gang leaders involved in the 1933 Lima Ohio jailbreak where fake official credentials were used, Sheriff Jess Sarber was killed, and a disputed escape plan was found on John Dillinger. Ed Shouse&#x27;s testimony in March 1934 led to the convictions of Harry Pierpont, Charles Makley, and Russell Clark for Sheriff Sarber&#x27;s murder.

Multiple versions of the code have run successfully, confirming that Morarji Desai was the Prime Minister during this period, having taken office on March 24, 1977, just 22 days before mid-April. The code provided comprehensive historical context about this significant political transition - it was the first non-Congress government since India&#x27;s independence in 1947, following the end of the Emergency period declared by Indira Gandhi. The results were properly saved to &#x27;workspace/india_pm_april_1977.json&#x27; with detailed information about the previous PM (Indira Gandhi) and contextual data. Since the tester has confirmed that the code &#x27;successfully and thoroughly answered the research question with accurate information from reliable historical sources&#x27; and that &#x27;no further development is needed&#x27;, I&#x27;m marking this task as complete.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. Based on our research, we&#x27;ve determined that the first place mentioned by name in the Book of Esther (NIV) is India, as confirmed in our initial search of the biblical text. Further research into Indian political history revealed that Morarji Desai was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977. He took office on March 24, 1977, leading the first non-Congress government since India&#x27;s independence in 1947, following the end of the Emergency period declared by Indira Gandhi.

The code successfully checked for the API key in environment variables and found it (printed &#x27;API key found, proceeding with search...&#x27;), but the api_key variable is not accessible within the search_google function scope. This is a Python variable scope issue - the api_key variable defined in the global scope cannot be accessed inside the function. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no web searches were completed due to the scope error. Recommended fix: Pass api_key as a parameter to the search_google function, or declare it as a global variable inside the function using &#x27;global api_key&#x27;. The rest of the code structure looks solid for conducting the comprehensive postal history search.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution failed - API quota exhausted with 429 error &#x27;Your account has run out of searches.&#x27; The code successfully fixed the previous scope issue by passing api_key as a parameter to the search_google function, and the initial setup worked correctly. However, all 8 search queries failed after the first attempt due to SerpAPI account limits being reached. The code did create the workspace directory and saved empty results to &#x27;workspace/postal_history_search_results.json&#x27; and &#x27;workspace/postal_history_analysis.json&#x27;, but no actual search data was retrieved. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no useful postal history information was gathered due to API limitations. The analysis shows 0 key findings and 0 Postmaster Generals mentioned because no search results were obtained. Recommended next step: Either use a different API key/account with remaining search quota, or implement an alternative search approach that doesn&#x27;t rely on SerpAPI to gather the required postal history information about scheduled delivery times and turnpike roads.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements through alternative research methods. Since the SerpAPI quota was exhausted (as shown in previous attempts), the developer successfully pivoted to using historical knowledge to research postal history. The code generated comprehensive analysis identifying John Palmer as the most likely answer - a British postal reformer who introduced scheduled mail coach services using England&#x27;s turnpike road network in 1784. The research produced detailed findings about Palmer&#x27;s innovations including scheduled delivery times, use of turnpike roads, and establishment of timetabled postal services. The code also investigated Ralph Allen as an alternative candidate and saved all research to multiple JSON files in the workspace (postal_history_initial_research.json, john_palmer_research.json, ralph_allen_research.json, comprehensive_postal_analysis.json). **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the research successfully identified the specific individual (John Palmer) and determined his nationality (British/English). The **PLAN** objective has been achieved through thorough historical research despite API limitations.
