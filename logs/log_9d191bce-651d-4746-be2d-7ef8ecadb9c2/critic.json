  "final_answer": "Extremely",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify Teal'c's exact response to the question 'Isn't that hot?' from a specific YouTube video. All three team members conducted comprehensive video analysis using different technical approaches but reached identical conclusions. Member 1 evaluation: Used video download, audio extraction with pydub, and speech recognition with normalization techniques. Successfully transcribed Teal'c's response as 'extremely' and provided character-consistent analysis noting this matches his direct speaking pattern from Stargate SG-1. Member 2 evaluation: Employed YouTube auto-generated subtitle extraction after initial speech recognition challenges. Located the dialogue at specific timestamps (question at 00:00:24.680, response at 00:00:26.720) and identified 'extremely' as the response, though noted this seemed atypical for Teal'c's usual speech patterns. Member 3 evaluation: Utilized faster-whisper transcription technology to process the 29.2-second audio file, identifying the question at 24.0s and Teal'c's response 'Extremely' at 26.0s, providing full dialogue context about coffee conversation. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: All three members independently identified identical response 'extremely/Extremely' using different technical methodologies (speech recognition, subtitle extraction, faster-whisper transcription). No contradictions exist between approaches. Synthesis validation: Multiple independent technical approaches confirming same result provides high confidence. The response occurs in context of coffee-related dialogue, consistent with known Stargate SG-1 scene where Teal'c tries coffee. Final answer 'Extremely' represents definitive conclusion supported by three independent analyses with different verification methods.",
