# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** cca70ce6-1952-45d2-acd4-80c903b0bc49  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-06 19:07:21

## Plan Content
```
Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/cca70ce6-1952-45d2-acd4-80c903b0bc49.png to examine the math quiz and identify each problem type. Determine which problems involve adding/subtracting fractions (5 points), multiplying/dividing fractions (10 points), forming improper fractions (15 points), or forming mixed numbers (20 points). Check each answer for correctness and calculate the total score including the 5 bonus points.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to examine the quiz image to see the actual problems and student answers before scoring, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this image file, (3) Expected outcome is to identify all problem types, verify answer correctness, and apply the scoring rubric, (4) This directly addresses the TASK by analyzing the quiz to determine the student's total earned points.

### Development Step 2: Analyze Python code file to understand logic, trace execution, and find its final numeric output.

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Python code file data/gaia/2023/validation/f918266a-b3e0-4914-865d-4faa564f1aef.py to understand its structure and logic. Read the complete code content, identify the main execution flow, trace through any calculations or operations, and determine what the final numeric output will be when this code is executed.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated security auditing of financial services Python scripts to detect unexpected exception paths and harmful random value usages before deployment
- Integration into a CI/CD pipeline for e-commerce microservices to trace code flow changes and prevent regressions in discount calculation logic
- Pre-release validation of healthcare analytics tools, ensuring that data sampling routines (randomized values) meet compliance criteria and don’t silently fail
- Educational platform feature that step-by-step parses student-submitted Python assignments, highlighting execution flow and exception handling for teaching programming concepts
- Quality assurance automation in IoT firmware code, analyzing logic paths that generate sensor threshold alerts to catch misconfigurations early
- Documentation generator for enterprise DevOps teams that reads source files, maps function and class structures, and produces human-readable execution overviews
- Research lab tool to validate stochastic simulation scripts by tracing random number generation criteria and logging first valid outcomes for reproducibility
- Government software compliance verifier that parses public sector codebases, traces exception-raising conditions, and produces audit-ready reports of code logic paths

- Static analysis of configuration and orchestration scripts in cloud infrastructure repositories to identify potential security vulnerabilities and resource misconfigurations
- Automated grading and feedback for computer science students by parsing submitted Python assignments, checking for required functions, loops, and print statements
- Quality assurance for educational content platforms by scanning tutorial code examples to ensure consistency, presence of docstrings, and accurate execution flow descriptions
- Code migration and refactoring planning for legacy systems by inventorying existing Python modules, mapping variable assignments and control structures, and estimating complexity
- Documentation generation for an open-source machine learning library by extracting function and class definitions, usage examples, and operation details from source files

### Development Step 1: Parse File Road Layout, Locate Houses, Mile Markers, Define Coordinates, Compute House-Tower Distances

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached file data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt to understand the road layout, identify all house positions, and map their locations relative to mile markers. Extract the visual representation showing dashes (-) as mile markers and H symbols as houses, then determine the coordinate system and calculate distances between houses and potential tower locations.

**Use Cases**:
- Rural broadband deployment planning: parse the ASCII road layout to extract house locations by mile marker, then calculate optimal fiber cable routes to bring high-speed internet to each home.
- Emergency medical services optimization: analyze the distances between mapped house positions and candidate ambulance station sites to determine the fastest response coverage along a remote highway.
- Postal delivery route automation: ingest the text-based road map to pinpoint rural mailbox locations, then compute the shortest delivery loop for mail carriers using mile-marker coordinates.
- Electric grid maintenance scheduling: map household positions relative to power line inspection crews’ depots to sequence pipeline or line checks by proximity and minimize downtime.
- Mobile network coverage analysis: identify service gaps by measuring distances from village houses to existing cell towers and recommend new tower installations to fill black spots.
- Environmental sensor network design: use the extracted house coordinates along farmland roads to position weather or soil-moisture sensors at optimal intervals for agricultural research.
- Real estate site evaluation: chart the distribution of roadside properties via mile markers to spotlight high-density clusters for targeted development and marketing campaigns.

### Development Step 1: Excel Grid Parsing: Record Cell Coordinates, Text, Fill Colors, Identify START and END Cells

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx to extract the complete grid structure: record for each cell its row–column coordinate, displayed text, and fill color as a 6-digit hex code, then identify the coordinates of the cell containing 'START' and the cell containing 'END'.

**Use Cases**:
- Project timeline extraction for construction management: parse a color-coded Gantt chart in Excel to import each task’s grid position, label, and scheduling colors, then automatically locate the “START” kickoff milestone and “END” completion point.
- Retail shelf planogram automation: extract the full store shelving grid with product names and color-coded stock levels from an Excel layout, identify the beginning (“START”) and end (“END”) of each aisle for dynamic planogram updates.
- AGV navigation map generation in manufacturing: read an Excel-based factory floor grid with zones highlighted by fill color, output precise coordinates for every cell, and locate the “START” docking station and “END” delivery bay for autonomous guided vehicles.
- Classroom seating performance analysis: parse a teacher’s Excel seating chart where student names and test scores are color-coded, record each desk’s coordinates and find designated “START” and “END” rows for group activities arrangement.
- Game level prototyping: convert a level design represented in Excel cells (with obstacles and power-ups color-coded) into JSON; pinpoint the “START” spawn cell and “END” exit cell for rapid engine import.
- Real estate floorplan digitization: extract room labels, dimensions, and color-coded zones (e.g., living, kitchen, bedrooms) from an Excel blueprint, capturing each cell’s coordinates and fill color, then identify the main “START” entrance and emergency “END” exits.
- High-throughput screening data mapping in biotech: interpret a microtiter plate layout from Excel, record each well’s row–column address, sample identifier, and color-coded assay result, and locate the “START” reference well and “END” control well for automated analysis.

I'm using GPT-4o multimodal capabilities to examine the image and identify each math problem, classify them by type (adding/subtracting fractions, multiplying/dividing fractions, forming improper fractions, or forming mixed numbers), verify the correctness of each answer, and calculate the total score. The code loads the image file, encodes it to base64, sends it to the GPT-4o API with detailed analysis instructions, and saves the results to workspace for further processing. This approach will give me a comprehensive understanding of all problems in the quiz before proceeding with detailed score calculations.",
