  "reason": "Task analysis: Grade a fraction quiz using specific point values (add/subtract: 5 points, multiply/divide: 10 points, improper fraction: 15 points, mixed number: 20 points) plus 5 bonus points for all students. Individual solution evaluation: Member 1 conducted comprehensive analysis identifying 10 problems, correctly classified each by type, verified student answers through detailed calculations, and determined 6 correct answers (problems with 10+5+20+5+15+5 = 60 points) plus 5 bonus points for 65 total. Member 2 performed similar systematic analysis but identified only 4 correct answers (problems 1, 5, 9, 10 earning 50 points) plus 5 bonus points for 55 total. Member 3 provided thorough analysis matching Member 1's approach, identifying 6 correct answers (problems 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10) earning 60 points plus 5 bonus points for 65 total. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 3 on methodology and final answer, while Member 2 diverged on answer correctness evaluation. Divergence resolution: Members 1 and 3 both provided detailed mathematical verification showing 6 correct answers, while Member 2's analysis appears to have missed 2 correct answers in the evaluation process. Synthesis evaluation: The consensus between Members 1 and 3, combined with their detailed mathematical work and verification processes, provides highest confidence. Both members demonstrated rigorous problem classification, thorough answer checking, and consistent scoring methodology. Final validation confirms 65 points as the most reliable and well-supported answer.",
