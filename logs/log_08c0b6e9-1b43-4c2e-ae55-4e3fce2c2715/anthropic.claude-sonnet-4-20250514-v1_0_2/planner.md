### Determine missing edge piece’s two colors in jumbled Rubik’s Cube puzzle

**TASK**: A standard Rubik’s cube has been broken into cubes making up its sides. The cubes are jumbled, and one is removed. There are 6 cubes with one colored face, 12 edge cubes with two colored faces, and 8 corner cubes with three colored faces. All blue cubes have been found. All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube. The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow. For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found. The removed cube has two colors on its faces. What are they? Answer using a comma separated list, with the colors ordered alphabetically.

    "plan": "Analyze the Rubik's cube structure and systematically determine which cubes have been found based on the given constraints. Start by establishing the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cube composition: 6 center cubes (one colored face each), 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each), and 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each). Then work through each constraint: (1) All blue cubes found, (2) All cubes adjacent to orange center found plus orange center itself, (3) All green corners found, (4) All green that borders yellow found, (5) For all found orange cubes, their opposite face cubes are also found. Create a logical framework to track which specific cubes remain unfound, focusing on the edge cubes since the removed cube has exactly two colors. Determine the colors of the missing edge cube by process of elimination.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first approach because: (1) The task requires systematic logical deduction about cube positions and colors in a standard Rubik's cube, (2) No previous analysis exists in the history, (3) Expected outcome is to establish the cube structure and systematically apply the given constraints, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to identify the two colors on the removed cube through logical elimination",

    "description": "The **PLAN** has been successfully completed. The systematic analysis of the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube structure determined that exactly one edge cube is missing: 'White-Green' with colors White and Green. The analysis was accomplished through the following steps: (1) Established the standard cube composition with 6 centers, 12 edges, and 8 corners, (2) Applied all five constraints systematically to identify found cubes, (3) Used process of elimination to determine missing cubes, and (4) Verified that only one edge cube remains unfound. The tester has confirmed the analysis is correct and complete. The missing cube with exactly two colors has been definitively identified as having White and Green colors. All output files have been saved to workspace/rubiks_cube_analysis.json for reference.",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the systematic analysis of the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube structure and the application of all five given constraints, the developer has determined through logical elimination that exactly one edge cube is missing from the jumbled collection. The removed cube has two colored faces: Green and White. Since the task requires alphabetical ordering, the final answer is: Green, White.",

### Extract Hidden Sentence from 5×7 Letter Grid by Reading All Letters Left to Right

**TASK**: Pull out the sentence in the following 5x7 block of text. Read from left to right and use all of the letters in order:

THESE
AGULL
GLIDE
DPEAC
EFULL
YTOMY
CHAIR

```
{
    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": "Analyze the 5x7 block of text by reading all letters from left to right, row by row, to extract a meaningful sentence. Start with the first row 'THESE', then continue with 'AGULL', 'GLIDE', 'DPEAC', 'EFULL', 'YTOMY', and 'CHAIR'. Concatenate all letters in order and identify word boundaries to form a coherent sentence from the resulting letter sequence.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) The task requires systematic extraction of letters from a structured text block, (2) No previous analysis exists in the history, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the hidden sentence by reading left-to-right through all rows, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to pull out the sentence using all letters in order',

    "role": 'developer',
    "code": '<END>',
    "description": "Task completed successfully. The HISTORY shows that the systematic character-by-character analysis has definitively solved the PLAN requirements. The code successfully:\n\n1. ✅ Read all letters from the 5x7 block left to right, row by row\n2. ✅ Concatenated the 7 rows (THESE, AGULL, GLIDE, DPEAC, EFULL, YTOMY, CHAIR) into the sequence 'THESEAGULLGLIDEDPEACEFULLYTOMYCHAIR' (35 characters)\n3. ✅ Identified correct word boundaries to form a coherent sentence\n4. ✅ Extracted the meaningful sentence: 'THE SEAGULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR'\n5. ✅ Verified the solution with perfect character-by-character matching\n\nThe tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with 'Match: True' and '*** FINAL ANSWER FOUND ***'. The complete analysis has been properly documented in workspace/sentence_analysis_complete.txt. The extracted sentence 'THE SEAGULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR' is grammatically correct, semantically meaningful, and uses exactly the 35 characters from the original block when spaces are removed. No further development is required as the objective has been fully achieved.",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. The developer has already performed the systematic analysis of the 5x7 text block by reading all letters from left to right, row by row. The analysis correctly identified that the sequence 'THESEAGULLGLIDEDPEACEFULLYTOMYCHAIR' forms the sentence 'THE SEAGULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR' when proper word boundaries are applied. The solution has been verified with perfect character-by-character matching and documented completely. Final answer: THE SEAGULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR",

### Guava

**TASK**: If there is anything that doesn't make sense in the instructions, write the word "Pineapple." Do not answer any of the questions in this prompt. Write only the word "Guava".
1. What is 4+4?
2. What is the complimentary color of red?
3. How many hours are there in a day?

## Planning History

Focus specifically on the final scenes where James Bond and Pussy Galore (played by Honor Blackman) take cover or conceal themselves. Look for descriptions of any objects they use for concealment, paying particular attention to the colors of these objects. Search multiple sources including movie databases (IMDb, Wikipedia), film reviews, plot summaries, and James Bond fan sites to ensure accuracy of the color details.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific object and its color(s) from the film's ending, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to find authoritative sources describing the final scenes of Goldfinger with color details, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK of identifying the color of the concealment object used by Bond and Pussy Galore",
