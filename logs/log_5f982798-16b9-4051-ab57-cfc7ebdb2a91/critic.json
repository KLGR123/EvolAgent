  "reason": "Task analysis: The user seeks the difference in measured time spans between two specific papers - a March 2021 multiwavelength FRB paper with X-ray time profile diagrams and a July 2020 paper by overlapping authors containing burst-1 diagrams. Individual solution evaluation: Member 1 conducted comprehensive searches but provided inconsistent final answers (3.23 seconds in planning vs no definitive conclusion in execution), showing methodological confusion between multiple candidate papers and lacking clear identification of the specific papers referenced in the task. Member 2 demonstrated superior analytical rigor by definitively identifying the March 2021 paper as 'Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts' by Nicastro et al. (arXiv:2103.07786v2) with Figure 7 showing INTEGRAL/IBIS-ISGRI X-ray time profiles (maximum 10 seconds), and the July 2020 paper by Burtovoi, Zampieri et al. (arXiv:2007.09980v1) with Figure 4 showing X-ray measurements (maximum 2020 seconds), calculating 2020-10=2010 seconds difference. Member 3's analysis was incomplete, failing to identify the March 2021 paper and concluding the task was impossible due to data unavailability. Cross-analysis reveals Member 2's approach uniquely succeeded in locating both papers with overlapping authors and extracting precise time span measurements from the relevant diagrams. Convergence assessment shows only Member 2 provided a definitive numerical answer with complete methodological justification. Resolution of divergence: Member 2's systematic identification of specific figures (Figure 7 for March 2021, Figure 4 for July 2020) and extraction of maximum time spans provides the most reliable foundation for comparison. Final validation confirms 2010 seconds as the difference between the maximum measured time spans in the two papers' X-ray time profile diagrams.",
