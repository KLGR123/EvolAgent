  "reason": "Task analysis: Calculate percentage of filtered penguins from CSV file relative to Wikipedia's 2012 upper penguin population estimates, with five decimal place precision. All members correctly parsed the CSV file containing 344 penguin records and identified the filtering criteria - penguins that don't live on Dream Island AND don't have beaks longer than 42mm. Member 1 made a critical logical error by applying OR logic instead of AND logic, incorrectly including 256 penguins (those on Dream Island OR with long beaks) rather than excluding both groups. Members 2 and 3 correctly applied AND logic, both identifying exactly 86 penguins that meet the criteria (don't live on Dream Island AND have beaks ≤42mm). Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 2 and 3 on filtering methodology and penguin count (86), while Member 1's approach contradicts the task requirements. For Wikipedia research, significant divergence exists: Member 1 found 1.8 million total penguins, Member 2 found 33.616 million individual penguins, and Member 3 found 20 million pairs (40 million individuals). Member 2's research appears most comprehensive, analyzing 7 Wikipedia pages with species-by-species breakdown and historical verification to ensure 2012 data accuracy. Member 3's conversion of pairs to individuals is methodologically sound but the base estimate seems lower. Member 1's estimate appears significantly underestimated. Resolution analysis: Members 2 and 3 both correctly identified 86 filtered penguins. Member 2's Wikipedia research demonstrates superior rigor with detailed species breakdown totaling 33.616 million penguins, while Member 3's 40 million estimate lacks the comprehensive species-level verification. Final calculation using Member 2's data: (86 ÷ 33,616,000) × 100 = 0.0002558%, which rounds to 0.00026 at five decimal places.",
