    "description": "This code implements a comprehensive search strategy to find the year of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. I'm accessing multiple Wikipedia sources including the specific Venezuelan Declaration of Independence page, Venezuelan War of Independence, and general Venezuela history pages. The approach involves: (1) Systematically accessing reliable historical sources, (2) Parsing content to identify independence-related information, (3) Using regex patterns to extract years mentioned in independence contexts, (4) Analyzing frequency of year mentions to determine the most reliable date, (5) Calculating L as the last two digits of the independence year. The code includes detailed logging to track findings and saves results to workspace for verification. This multi-source approach ensures accuracy in determining the historical date needed for the calculation.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed the **PLAN** requirements. The script accessed 4 reliable Wikipedia sources about Venezuelan independence, analyzed their content using pattern matching and frequency analysis, and determined that 1811 is the year of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence (mentioned 4 times across sources, tied with 1810 but contextually more specific to the declaration itself). The code correctly calculated L = 11 (last two digits of 1811) and saved comprehensive analysis results to 'workspace/venezuelan_independence_analysis.json'. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the specific year when Venezuela declared independence from Spanish colonial rule has been found and the L value determined. The analysis shows high confidence with multiple authoritative sources confirming July 5, 1811 as the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence date. No further development is needed.",

    "description": "This code verifies the previously determined Venezuelan independence year by inspecting the saved analysis file. I'm first examining the file structure to understand the data format, then extracting and validating the key findings including the independence year (1811) and L value (11). The verification includes reviewing the year frequency analysis, source credibility assessment, and historical context to confirm accuracy. The approach ensures that the PLAN requirement has been met - finding the specific year Venezuela declared independence from Spanish colonial rule. The analysis confirms 1811 as the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence year, making L = 11 (last two digits). This comprehensive verification validates the research methodology and provides confidence in the final answer.",

    "feedback": 'Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed a comprehensive verification of the previously determined independence year. The script successfully loaded and analyzed the saved analysis file, confirming that 1811 is the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence year with L = 11. The verification shows excellent results: 4 Wikipedia sources analyzed, high confidence level, and 1811 mentioned 4 times in independence contexts across multiple authoritative sources. The code provided detailed historical context (1810 revolution beginning, 1811 formal declaration, 1821 final independence) and confirmed that 1811 represents the specific formal declaration requested in the **PLAN**. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence year (1811) and L value (11) have been definitively determined and verified. The analysis demonstrates that Venezuela formally declared independence from Spanish colonial rule on July 5, 1811. No further development is needed - the objective has been fully achieved.',

    "description": 'The PLAN has been successfully completed. The comprehensive analysis conducted in the previous iterations definitively determined that Venezuela declared independence from Spanish colonial rule in 1811. The research methodology involved: (1) Accessing 4 authoritative Wikipedia sources including the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence page, Venezuelan War of Independence, History of Venezuela, and main Venezuela page, (2) Using systematic pattern matching and frequency analysis to identify years mentioned in independence contexts, (3) Cross-referencing findings across multiple sources for validation. The results show 1811 mentioned 4 times in independence contexts, tied with 1810 but contextually more specific to the formal declaration itself. Historical verification confirms July 5, 1811 as the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence date. Therefore, L = 11 (last two digits of 1811). The analysis achieved high confidence with multiple authoritative sources and comprehensive documentation saved to workspace/venezuelan_independence_analysis.json. No further development is needed as the objective has been fully achieved with verified results.',
