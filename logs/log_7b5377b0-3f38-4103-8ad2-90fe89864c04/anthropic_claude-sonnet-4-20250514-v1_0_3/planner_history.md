    "plan": 'Search for the year of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence to determine the value of L (the last two digits of that year). Focus on finding the specific year when Venezuela declared independence from Spanish colonial rule, which should be readily available from historical sources and encyclopedias.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify three separate variables (L, A, C) before we can solve the differential equation Lx = (d/dx * (A * x²)) + 4097 - C, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to determine the year of Venezuelan independence and extract its last two digits for variable L, (4) This systematically addresses one of the three required variables needed to complete the mathematical calculation in the TASK.',

    "description": 'The PLAN has been successfully completed. The comprehensive analysis conducted in the previous iterations definitively determined that Venezuela declared independence from Spanish colonial rule in 1811. The research methodology involved: (1) Accessing 4 authoritative Wikipedia sources including the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence page, Venezuelan War of Independence, History of Venezuela, and main Venezuela page, (2) Using systematic pattern matching and frequency analysis to identify years mentioned in independence contexts, (3) Cross-referencing findings across multiple sources for validation. The results show 1811 mentioned 4 times in independence contexts, tied with 1810 but contextually more specific to the formal declaration itself. Historical verification confirms July 5, 1811 as the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence date. Therefore, L = 11 (last two digits of 1811). The analysis achieved high confidence with multiple authoritative sources and comprehensive documentation saved to workspace/venezuelan_independence_analysis.json. No further development is needed as the objective has been fully achieved with verified results.',

    "plan": 'Search for information about the TikTok logo as of July 2023 to determine the number of colors excluding black and white (variable A). Focus on finding official TikTok branding guidelines, logo specifications, or reliable sources that describe the color composition of the TikTok logo during that specific time period.',
    "description": 'This is the logical next step because: (1) We have successfully determined L = 11 from the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence year 1811, (2) We still need to find variables A (TikTok logo colors) and C (average Filipino woman height) before solving the equation, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific colors used in the TikTok logo as of July 2023, excluding black and white, (4) This systematically addresses the second of three required variables needed to complete the mathematical calculation Lx = (d/dx * (A * x²)) + 4097 - C.',

    "description": "The PLAN has been successfully completed through the previous iterations. The comprehensive analysis definitively determined that the TikTok logo as of July 2023 uses 2 colors excluding black and white: pink/magenta and cyan/teal. The research methodology involved: (1) Multi-source web analysis accessing official TikTok sources including Wikipedia, newsroom, and brand pages, (2) Enhanced color detection using regex patterns for hex codes, RGB values, and color names in TikTok contexts, (3) Cross-referencing findings with established TikTok branding knowledge, (4) Validation across multiple analysis iterations with consistent results. The final determination shows A = 2, representing the pink/magenta primary brand color (#FF0050 or similar) and cyan/teal secondary brand color (#00F2EA or similar) that create TikTok's distinctive gradient logo effect. This branding has remained consistent since TikTok's global launch with no changes in July 2023. The analysis achieved high confidence with comprehensive documentation saved to multiple workspace files including 'tiktok_logo_final_determination.json', 'tiktok_logo_color_final_analysis.json', and 'tiktok_logo_verification_final.json'. The objective to find information about TikTok logo colors as of July 2023 and determine variable A (number of colors excluding black and white) has been fully achieved with verified results.",

    "plan": "Search for the average height of women in the Philippines according to a July 2023 Business Insider article to determine variable C (rounded to the nearest whole centimeter). Focus on finding the specific Business Insider article from July 2023 that reports on Filipino women's average height statistics.",
    "description": 'This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully determined L = 11 (last two digits of 1811) and A = 2 (TikTok logo colors excluding black and white), (2) We need the final variable C (average Filipino woman height from July 2023 Business Insider article) before we can solve the equation Lx = (d/dx * (A * x²)) + 4097 - C, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the specific Business Insider article and extract the height measurement in centimeters, (4) This will provide the third and final variable needed to complete the differential equation calculation and solve for x to the nearest tenth.',
