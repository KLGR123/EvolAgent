## Plan Content
```
Research the TikTok logo as of July 2023 to determine how many colors it contains, excluding black and white, to find the value of A in the equation.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the logical next step because: (1) We have successfully determined L = 11 from the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence year 1811, (2) We need to identify the number of colors in the TikTok logo as of July 2023 (excluding black and white) to calculate A, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the exact color count for the TikTok logo during the specified timeframe, (4) This addresses the second of three variables (L, A, C) needed to solve the mathematical equation for x.

### Development Step 21: Breadth-First Search from START to END: 11th Two-Cell Move Landing Cell Hex Color

**Description**: Perform a breadth-first search on workspace/adjacency_cardinal.json starting from the START coordinate from workspace/start_end_coordinates.json to find the shortest path to the END coordinate; then identify the coordinate at index 11 in the resulting path (representing the landing cell after the eleventh two-cell move) and retrieve its 6-digit hex fill_color from workspace/grid_data.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Indoor cleaning robot navigation and floor-condition detection by computing the 11th tile on its shortest path and checking its color code to decide vacuum settings
- Augmented reality game level mapping where the engine finds the terrain cell reached after 11 cardinal moves and retrieves its texture color for rendering effects
- Warehouse order-picking automation that plans the quickest route to an item, identifies the 11th aisle marker on that path, and reads its floor-painting color for location confirmation
- Agricultural field drone flight planning that performs a grid search over crop plots, lands on the 11th block along the optimal route, and reads its soil-moisture color classification
- Urban evacuation route analysis that finds the shortest pedestrian path through a city grid, highlights the 11th block, and inspects its zoning color to assess safety
- Autonomous vehicle test track mapping which computes the fastest route, marks the 11th corner coordinate on that lap, and fetches its pavement-paint color for sensor calibration
- Museum wayfinding application that plots the shortest corridor path from entrance to exhibit, reaches the 11th room, and retrieves its display-wall color for touchscreen feedback
- Pipeline inspection scheduling that models the connectivity graph of segments, navigates to the 11th node on the maintenance route, and checks its material-coating color code for repair prioritization

### Development Step 1: Determine Missing Edge Cube Colors in Rubik’s Cube from Found-Cube Constraints

**Description**: Analyze the Rubik's cube structure and systematically determine which cubes have been found based on the given constraints. Start by establishing the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cube composition: 6 center cubes (one colored face each), 12 edge cubes (two colored faces each), and 8 corner cubes (three colored faces each). Then work through each constraint: (1) All blue cubes found, (2) All cubes adjacent to orange center found plus orange center itself, (3) All green corners found, (4) All green that borders yellow found, (5) For all found orange cubes, their opposite face cubes are also found. Create a logical framework to track which specific cubes remain unfound, focusing on the edge cubes since the removed cube has exactly two colors. Determine the colors of the missing edge cube by process of elimination.

**Use Cases**:
- Toy manufacturing quality assurance in Rubik’s cube production lines: automating detection of missing or miscolored edge pieces via cube state analysis before packaging
- Augmented reality educational platform for teaching constraint logic and combinatorics: visualizing found versus missing cubelets and guiding students through elimination puzzles
- Robotic assembly validation in automated puzzle packaging systems: verifying that each dispatched Rubik’s cube contains the full set of edge and corner pieces
- Puzzle rental service inventory management: scanning returned cubes to quickly identify any missing edge pieces and trigger replacement orders
- Competitive speedcubing training analytics: analyzing cube initialization states to detect unintended piece rearrangements and optimize startup consistency
- Academic research in group theory and permutation puzzles: programmatically generating missing‐piece scenarios to study solvability under different constraint sets
- Virtual Rubik’s cube solver diagnostic tool: identifying and isolating missing edge cubes in digital simulations to aid debugging and developer testing
- Mechanical puzzle–based security lock integrity check: verifying the completeness of a cube lock mechanism by ensuring no edge components have been tampered with or removed

### Development Step 19: BFS Shortest Path: 11th Two-Cell Move Landing Cell Hex Color

**Description**: Perform a breadth-first search on workspace/adjacency_cardinal.json starting from the START coordinate from workspace/start_end_coordinates.json to find the shortest path to the END coordinate; then identify the coordinate at index 11 in the resulting path (representing the landing cell after the eleventh two-cell move) and retrieve its 6-digit hex fill_color from workspace/grid_data.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Autonomous warehouse robot path planning on grid floor tiles, retrieving the 11th tile’s wear-level hex color code for predictive maintenance scheduling
- Drone-based agricultural field survey navigating a grid of crop plots, identifying the 11th plot’s vegetation health hex color for variable-rate fertilization
- Urban planning pedestrian navigation simulation on city-block adjacency, extracting the 11th intersection’s zoning hex color to assess accessibility improvements
- Network packet tracing over a mesh of routers, computing the shortest path to a destination and retrieving the 11th hop’s status hex color for diagnostics
- Automated guided vehicle (AGV) routing in a manufacturing plant, determining the 11th floor marker tile’s safety hex color to dynamically adjust vehicle speed
- Video game AI NPC navigation on a tile-based map, finding the shortest route to a quest objective and checking the 11th tile’s terrain hex color for movement-cost calculation
- Disaster evacuation modeling in a hospital layout grid, plotting the exit route and inspecting the 11th door’s hazard-level hex color to ensure safe egress
- Archaeological site scanning with ground-penetrating radar, mapping a grid of excavation sectors, planning a survey path and retrieving the 11th sector’s soil anomaly hex color for sampling prioritization

### Development Step 2: Investigate Goldfinger’s Final Scenes: Bond and Pussy Galore’s Concealment Objects and Their Colors

**Description**: Search for detailed information about the ending of the 1964 James Bond film 'Goldfinger' starring Sean Connery. Focus specifically on the final scenes where James Bond and Pussy Galore (played by Honor Blackman) take cover or conceal themselves. Look for descriptions of any objects they use for concealment, paying particular attention to the colors of these objects. Search multiple sources including movie databases (IMDb, Wikipedia), film reviews, plot summaries, and James Bond fan sites to ensure accuracy of the color details.

**Use Cases**:
- Film preservation and restoration teams verifying accurate color data of props and costumes to guide digital color correction processes
- Cinema studies researchers automating detailed scene analysis, such as identifying prop colors in specific film segments for academic papers on color symbolism
- Streaming platforms enriching metadata by automatically extracting visual details (e.g., parachute colors) from movie endings to improve search and recommendation features
- Film trivia and fan site editors aggregating precise color information about iconic scenes for creating authoritative guides and trivia databases
- Production designers benchmarking historical prop and costume color palettes for period-accurate set designs based on classic movie references
- Digital archivists organizing and tagging archived movie content with fine-grained visual descriptors (prop color data) to enhance archival retrieval systems
- Machine learning engineers constructing annotated datasets of film visuals, including object color labels, for training computer vision models to recognize objects in movie scenes
- Entertainment journalists fact-checking visual elements of classic films when writing retrospective articles or anniversary features to ensure accurate reporting

The research involved multiple targeted searches that yielded consistent evidence from authoritative sources: (1) designpieces.com explicitly states 'The brand color palette for TikTok is made up of 3 colors', (2) Multiple sources consistently identify the three colors as Pink (#ff0050), Cyan/Aqua (#00f2ea), and Red, (3) Sources mentioning 4 colors include black and white which were correctly excluded per the PLAN requirements. All search results were saved to workspace files (tiktok_logo_colors_search1.json, tiktok_logo_colors_search2.json, tiktok_logo_colors_search3.json) and a comprehensive analysis was documented in tiktok_logo_color_analysis.json.
