## Final Answer
```
789.4
```

## Reasoning
```
Task decomposition: Solve differential equation Lx = (d/dx * (A * xÂ²)) + 4097 - C where L = last two digits of Venezuelan independence year, A = TikTok logo colors (excluding black/white), C = average Filipino woman height (rounded to nearest cm). Individual evaluation: Member 1 determined A = 3 through comprehensive analysis of 28 sources, finding consistent evidence for pink/magenta, cyan/aqua, and additional blue/red variations with explicit '3 colors' confirmation from authoritative sources. Member 2 determined A = 2 based on 25+ sources but focused primarily on two main colors (pink and cyan), missing the third color component identified by other sources. Member 3 determined A = 3 with targeted research confirming designpieces.com statement 'made up of 3 colors' and consistent identification of pink, cyan, and red. All members correctly found L = 11 (from 1811 Venezuelan independence) and C = 150 (from Business Insider article stating 149.6cm average height). Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on L and C values, with divergence on A value between 2 and 3 colors. Evidence evaluation shows Members 1 and 3 provided more comprehensive color analysis with explicit multi-source confirmation of 3 colors, while Member 2's analysis was more restrictive. Mathematical synthesis: Using A = 3 (most thoroughly supported), the equation becomes 11x = 6x + 4097 - 150, simplifying to 5x = 3947, yielding x = 789.4. Verification confirms both sides equal 8683.4. Final validation shows consistent mathematical execution across all members with A = 3, demonstrating high confidence in result.
