### Determine hex color of 11th move landing cell on Excel grid avoiding blue cells

**TASK**: You are given this Excel file as a map. You start on the START cell and move toward the END cell. You are allowed to move two cells per turn, and you may move up, down, left, or right. You may not move fewer than two cells, and you may not move backward. You must avoid moving onto any blue cells. On the eleventh turn, what is the 6-digit hex code (without prefix) of the color of the cell where you land after moving?

Based on the HISTORY feedback from the tester, the implementation achieved 100% alignment with the PLAN requirements:\n\n**Completed Tasks:**\n1. ✓ Calculated derivative: d/dx(A * x²) = d/dx(2x²) = 4x using power rule\n2. ✓ Substituted all values: L=11, A=2, C=150 into equation Lx = (d/dx * (A * x²)) + 4097 - C\n3. ✓ Simplified to: 11x = 4x + 3947\n4. ✓ Solved algebraically: 7x = 3947, therefore x = 563.8571428571429\n5. ✓ Rounded to nearest tenth: x = 563.9\n6. ✓ Verified solution by substitution (both sides equal 6202.428571428572 with zero difference)\n7. ✓ Saved detailed step-by-step solution to workspace/differential_equation_solution.txt\n\n**Final Answer:** x = 563.9 (rounded to the nearest tenth)\n\n**Verification:** The solution was mathematically verified by substituting back into the original equation, confirming accuracy with zero computational difference between left and right sides.\n\nThe tester confirmed that no further development is needed as all PLAN requirements have been met successfully. The differential equation solution is complete and correct.',

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive analysis performed throughout the HISTORY: (1) L = 11 was determined from the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence year (1811), (2) A = 2 was identified as the number of colors in the TikTok logo excluding black and white as of July 2023, (3) C = 150 was found from the Business Insider article about the average height of Filipino women rounded to the nearest centimeter, (4) The differential equation Lx = (d/dx * (A * x²)) + 4097 - C was solved by calculating the derivative d/dx(2x²) = 4x, substituting values to get 11x = 4x + 3947, solving 7x = 3947 to find x = 563.857..., and rounding to the nearest tenth. Final answer: x = 563.9',
