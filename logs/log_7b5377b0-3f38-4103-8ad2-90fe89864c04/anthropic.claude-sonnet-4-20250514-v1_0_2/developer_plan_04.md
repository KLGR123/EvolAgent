## Plan Content
```
Solve the differential equation Lx = (d/dx * (A * x²)) + 4097 - C using the determined values L = 11, A = 2, and C = 150. First calculate the derivative d/dx(A * x²) = d/dx(2x²) = 4x, then substitute into the equation 11x = 4x + 4097 - 150, simplify to find x, and round the result to the nearest tenth as requested.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the final step because: (1) We have successfully determined all three variables from the HISTORY: L = 11 (last two digits of 1811), A = 2 (TikTok logo colors excluding black/white), and C = 150 (Filipino women's average height rounded to nearest cm), (2) The equation can now be solved by taking the derivative and substituting the known values, (3) Expected outcome is the value of x rounded to the nearest tenth, (4) This completes the TASK by solving the mathematical equation with all required variables determined through comprehensive research.

### Development Step 2: Newton's Method to Four-Decimal Convergence for f(x)=x³+4x²−3x+8 from x₀=−5

**Description**: Implement Newton's Method for the function f(x) = x³ + 4x² - 3x + 8 starting with x₀ = -5. Calculate the derivative f'(x) = 3x² + 8x - 3 and apply the iterative formula xₙ₊₁ = xₙ - f(xₙ)/f'(xₙ). Continue iterations until finding the smallest n where xₙ = xₙ₊₁ when both values are rounded to four decimal places. Track each iteration's values and identify when convergence occurs at the specified precision level.

**Use Cases**:
- Aerospace control system calibration for determining the equilibrium pitch angle by finding the real root of a cubic lift‐force polynomial
- Chemical reactor steady‐state analysis to solve the cubic rate equation for reactant concentration convergence during process optimization
- Analog circuit design validation for locating the operating point in transistor models governed by a cubic current‐voltage characteristic
- Structural engineering beam deflection assessment by computing the root of a cubic bending equation to ensure safety compliance under load
- Robotics inverse kinematics refinement to find actuator joint angles from a cubic displacement equation for precise end‐effector positioning
- Pharmaceutical dissolution modeling to determine the concentration root in a cubic solubility equation for formulating controlled‐release tablets
- Financial model calibration to solve the cubic polynomial arising in yield curve fitting and achieve convergence at target precision
- Computer graphics ray‐surface intersection computation for cubic Bézier patches to accurately render complex curved surfaces

### Development Step 1: Newton’s Method for x³+4x²−3x+8: Iterations to Four-Decimal Convergence

**Description**: Implement Newton's Method for the function f(x) = x³ + 4x² - 3x + 8 starting with x₀ = -5. Calculate the derivative f'(x) = 3x² + 8x - 3 and apply the iterative formula xₙ₊₁ = xₙ - f(xₙ)/f'(xₙ). Continue iterations until finding the smallest n where xₙ = xₙ₊₁ when both values are rounded to four decimal places. Track each iteration's values and identify when convergence occurs at the specified precision level.

**Use Cases**:
- Mechanical engineering beam deflection analysis by solving the cubic equilibrium equation f(x)=x³+4x²−3x+8=0 with Newton’s Method to predict critical load points
- Chemical process optimization for phase equilibrium using a simplified Van der Waals cubic equation f(x)=x³+4x²−3x+8=0 and Newton’s Method to determine molar volume at given temperature and pressure
- Financial modeling of an internal rate of return (IRR) where the NPV function is approximated as f(r)=r³+4r²−3r+8 and Newton’s Method is applied to find the discount rate that zeroes NPV
- Control systems stability analysis by solving the characteristic polynomial f(s)=s³+4s²−3s+8=0 using Newton’s Method to locate closed-loop poles and ensure system damping requirements
- Computer graphics curve-line intersection calculation for a cubic Bezier curve defined by f(t)=t³+4t²−3t+8 and Newton’s Method to compute precise parameter values at intersection points
- Robotics inverse kinematics for a three-link manipulator where the joint-angle equation simplifies to f(θ)=θ³+4θ²−3θ+8=0, using Newton’s Method to converge on the correct actuator angle
- Electrical circuit transient analysis by finding the natural response roots of an RLC network’s cubic characteristic f(i)=i³+4i²−3i+8=0 with Newton’s Method for accurate time-domain predictions
- Environmental modeling of contaminant dispersion where the concentration balance yields f(x)=x³+4x²−3x+8=0, and Newton’s Method is used to solve for equilibrium pollutant levels in soil or water

### Development Step 3: Newton’s Method for f(x)=x³+4x²−3x+8 from x₀=−5 to Four-Decimal Convergence

**Description**: Implement Newton's Method for the function f(x) = x³ + 4x² - 3x + 8 starting with x₀ = -5. Calculate the derivative f'(x) = 3x² + 8x - 3 and apply the iterative formula xₙ₊₁ = xₙ - f(xₙ)/f'(xₙ). Continue iterations until finding the smallest n where xₙ = xₙ₊₁ when both values are rounded to four decimal places. Track each iteration's values and identify when convergence occurs at the specified precision level.

**Use Cases**:
- Calibrating a non-linear sensor response in aerospace instrumentation by finding the root of its cubic output polynomial, while logging each Newton iteration for quality assurance and traceability
- Determining the break-even point in a manufacturing cost-revenue model represented by a cubic equation, with detailed iteration tracking to support accurate financial forecasting

### Development Step 2: Extract locomotive details and calculate steam vs non-steam odds for Sunset Picnic Trip

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/4d0aa727-86b1-406b-9b33-f870dd14a4a5.xlsx to extract locomotive data including identifying numbers, operating status, and assigned daily excursions. Specifically identify all locomotives assigned to the 'Sunset Picnic Trip' and determine how many are steam locomotives versus other types to calculate the probability odds.

**Use Cases**:
- Heritage railway event planning: automatically identify which steam locomotives are assigned to the upcoming “Sunset Picnic Trip” and calculate the odds of running a steam engine versus diesel to optimize marketing materials.
- Tourist excursion operations: integrate daily assignment data to determine locomotive type distribution on scenic trips and adjust staffing levels for boiler tenders versus diesel mechanics.
- Maintenance scheduling automation: parse weekly Excel rosters to flag steam engines on high-profile excursions, calculate their usage probability, and prioritize preventive maintenance windows.
- Safety compliance reporting: filter out locomotives operating on specific passenger routes, classify them by steam or diesel, and generate probability-based risk summaries for regulatory submissions.
- Historical performance research: extract assignment patterns for nostalgic steam excursions from archival spreadsheets, quantify steam-versus-diesel frequency, and support academic studies on heritage railway trends.
- Asset allocation optimization: analyze Excel-based locomotive rosters to compute odds of steam deployment on themed trips, informing fuel stock purchasing decisions and crew training allocations.
- Real-time excursion monitoring: automate ingestion of daily assignment sheets to classify locomotives by type, calculate steam-to-diesel ratios on special trips, and feed live dashboards for operations control.
- Financial forecasting for excursion tours: use historical locomotive assignment and type-probability data to predict operating costs on future “Sunset Picnic Trip” runs, factoring in steam fuel and maintenance overhead.

    "description": 'This implementation solves the given differential equation step-by-step. First, I calculate the derivative d/dx(A * x²) = d/dx(2x²) = 4x using the power rule. Then I substitute all known values (L=11, A=2, C=150) into the equation Lx = (d/dx * (A * x²)) + 4097 - C, which becomes 11x = 4x + 4097 - 150. Simplifying the constant term (4097 - 150 = 3947) and rearranging to isolate x terms gives us 7x = 3947. Solving for x yields x = 563.857..., which rounds to 563.9 when rounded to the nearest tenth. The solution includes verification by substituting back into the original equation and saves detailed step-by-step work to the workspace for reference.',
