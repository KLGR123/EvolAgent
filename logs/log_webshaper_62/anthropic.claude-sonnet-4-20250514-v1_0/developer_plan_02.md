## Plan Content
```
Search for information about Cesar Tovar's death date and year. Focus on finding biographical information, obituaries, or baseball databases that contain details about when Cesar Tovar passed away. Look for reliable sources including Baseball Reference, MLB records, newspaper obituaries, or sports history databases that document his death year.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The previous research successfully identified Cesar Tovar as the baseball player with the unusual walk style nickname 'Pepito' who stole 30 bases (closest to 29) in the 1970 season, (2) We now need to determine when he died to complete the TASK, (3) Expected outcome is to find the specific year of Cesar Tovar's death from authoritative baseball or biographical sources, (4) This will provide the final answer needed to complete the TASK about the death year of this distinctive baseball player

### Development Step 37: Search and Verify Bill Woodfull‚Äôs Date of Death and Year

**Description**: Search for information about when Bill Woodfull, the Australian cricket captain who led Australia when Don Bradman scored 334 runs against England at Leeds in 1930, passed away. Focus on finding his death date and year using search terms including 'Bill Woodfull death date', 'Bill Woodfull died year', 'Bill Woodfull Australian cricket captain obituary', and 'William Woodfull death'. Verify the information from reliable cricket databases, historical records, or official sources.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical biography verification and data enrichment for a cricket museum‚Äôs online exhibit, ensuring captain profiles include accurate death dates
- Automated fact-checking and death date extraction for sports journalism workflows in a major news agency
- Genealogical research automation and obituary date confirmation for a family history and ancestry website
- Knowledge-base enrichment and metadata tagging for academic library digital archives of sports figures
- Automated quality assurance and reference validation for Wikipedia editors maintaining cricket captain biographies
- Obituary extraction and timeline generation for alumni newsletters at educational institutions with prominent athlete graduates
- Sports analytics content curation and historical player profile updates for cricket statistic databases and fan portals

### Development Step 16: Find and Confirm Greg Chappell‚Äôs Death Date and Year from Reliable Sources

**Description**: Search for information about when Greg Chappell passed away. Focus on finding his death date and year, using search terms including 'Greg Chappell death date', 'Greg Chappell died year', 'Greg Chappell obituary', and 'Greg Chappell Australian cricketer death'. Verify the information from reliable sources such as cricket databases, news archives, or official cricket organizations.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports heritage museums verifying the living status of former cricket players before updating digital hall-of-fame exhibits
- News wire services automatically fact-checking obituaries for prominent figures against archived web pages and official cricket databases
- Genealogy software tools cross-referencing online records to confirm ancestral death dates and avoid erroneous family tree entries
- CRM data cleansing workflows detecting deceased contacts by analyzing web content, obituaries, and official announcements to maintain accurate client lists
- Legal compliance systems validating whether individuals are alive before serving court documents or processing estate claims
- Insurance underwriting platforms automatically verifying applicant mortality status using public sports archives, news articles, and obituaries
- Academic research projects performing large-scale historical status validation of scientists, artists, and athletes by parsing web archives and biographies

TARGET: Greg Chappell (Australian Cricket Legend)
BORN: August 7, 1948
PROFESSION: Former Australian Cricket Captain and Coach

INVESTIGATION SUMMARY:
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive web searches conducted with targeted death-related queries
‚Ä¢ {final_summary['search_analysis_results']['total_greg_chappell_mentions_found']} total mentions of "Greg Chappell" found in search results
‚Ä¢ {final_summary['search_analysis_results']['death_evidence_instances']} death evidence instances discovered
‚Ä¢ {final_summary['search_analysis_results']['death_year_evidence_instances']} specific death year references found

DEATH INFORMATION DISCOVERED:
Multiple obituaries were found for people named Greg Chappell, but these
relate to DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS, not the Australian cricket legend:

1. Greg Chappell (Snellville, Georgia) - died November 25, 2024, age 68
2. Gregory Jo-lan Chappell (Odenton, Maryland) - died December 28, 2024

CRICKET LEGEND STATUS:
‚úÖ ALIVE - Greg Chappell (the Australian cricket legend) has NOT passed away

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH

REASONING:
‚Ä¢ No credible death information found for the Australian cricket captain
‚Ä¢ All obituaries discovered relate to different people with the same name
‚Ä¢ Death of cricket legends is typically widely reported by cricket media
‚Ä¢ Systematic absence of death information in cricket-specific searches
‚Ä¢ Born 1948, currently 76-77 years old - reasonable age to still be alive

VERIFICATION SOURCES:

CONCLUSION:
Greg Chappell (Australian cricket legend, born August 7, 1948) is still

This code executes targeted searches using multiple death-related queries specifically focused on the Venezuelan baseball player. The approach includes: (1) Six targeted search queries combining 'Cesar Tovar', 'death', 'obituary', 'baseball', and 'MLB' terms, (2) Systematic result collection and categorization based on death indicators, obituary mentions, and baseball context, (3) Pattern matching for specific death years (1990s-2000s range), (4) Detailed analysis of search results with relevance scoring, (5) Comprehensive data storage in workspace directory for further analysis. The code provides extensive logging and progress tracking to help identify the most promising sources for Cesar Tovar's death date and year from reliable baseball databases and obituary records.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed the **PLAN** requirements. The search investigation found comprehensive and consistent death date information for Cesar Tovar across multiple reliable sources. The output clearly shows that Cesar Tovar died on July 14, 1994, at age 54 in Caracas, Venezuela, from pancreatic cancer. Multiple authoritative baseball sources confirm this information including Wikipedia, Baseball Reference, MLB.com, NY Times obituary, LA Times, and Baseball Almanac. The **PLAN** objective to find Cesar Tovar's death date and year from reliable baseball databases and obituaries has been 100% achieved. However, the output is quite lengthy (200+ lines) and contains valuable search results and analysis that should be preserved.
