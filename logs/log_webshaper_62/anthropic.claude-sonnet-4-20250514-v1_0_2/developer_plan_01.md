# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_62  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-12 04:28:05

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about a baseball player who was nicknamed for his unusual walk style, stole 29 bases during the 1970 season, and was traded from the Chicago White Sox in 1971 in exchange for Tommy McCraw. Focus on identifying this specific player by searching for keywords including 'Chicago White Sox 1971 trade Tommy McCraw', 'baseball player unusual walk nickname', '29 stolen bases 1970 season', and cross-reference these criteria to find the player's name and biographical details.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific baseball player who meets all the criteria mentioned in the TASK, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the player's name and confirm the trade details involving Tommy McCraw and the White Sox in 1971, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to then determine when this player died

### Development Step 1: 1977 Yankees Player Walk Totals: Identify Highest Walker and Record Their At-Bats

**Description**: Search for comprehensive 1977 New York Yankees regular season statistics focusing on individual player walk totals. Target these information sources: (1) Official MLB statistics databases or archives, (2) Baseball-Reference.com historical data for 1977 Yankees roster, (3) Sports statistics websites with detailed seasonal breakdowns, (4) Historical baseball records covering individual player performance metrics. Extract complete batting statistics including walks (BB) and at-bats (AB) for all Yankees players during the 1977 regular season. Identify the player with the highest walk total and record their corresponding at-bat count for verification.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports journalist preparing a retrospective article on the 1977 Yankees’ plate discipline by automating extraction of walk (BB) and at-bat (AB) statistics for key players.
- Baseball sabermetric researcher integrating 1977 Yankees walk and at-bat data into a player valuation model to compare on-base contributions across the roster.
- Fantasy baseball platform enriching vintage player profiles by scraping 1977 season BB and AB totals for fan leaderboards and historical matchup tools.
- Sports memorabilia e-commerce site validating authenticity of signed items by cross-referencing player season statistics (walks and at-bats) extracted from official archives.
- Data science instructor designing a hands-on web-scraping assignment that uses Baseball-Reference 1977 Yankees data to teach students ETL and analysis workflows.
- Sports television production team generating on-air graphics for a documentary on the 1977 championship season by programmatically retrieving walk and at-bat metrics.
- Machine learning engineer curating a historical baseball dataset to train models on plate discipline trends using automated scraping of 1977 Yankees batting statistics.
- Baseball historian building a searchable digital archive of player performance by importing 1977 Yankees BB and AB data into a relational database for longitudinal studies.

### Development Step 4: 1977 New York Yankees Walk Totals and At-Bats: Top Walk Leader Identification

**Description**: Search for comprehensive 1977 New York Yankees regular season statistics focusing on individual player walk totals. Target these information sources: (1) Official MLB statistics databases or archives, (2) Baseball-Reference.com historical data for 1977 Yankees roster, (3) Sports statistics websites with detailed seasonal breakdowns, (4) Historical baseball records covering individual player performance metrics. Extract complete batting statistics including walks (BB) and at-bats (AB) for all Yankees players during the 1977 regular season. Identify the player with the highest walk total and record their corresponding at-bat count for verification.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated sports analytics pipeline for a baseball statistics website that scrapes historical MLB table data, filters out summary rows, and ranks players by walk-to-at-bat ratios.
- Fantasy baseball app backend for generating custom leaderboards from Baseball-Reference tables by extracting individual player walk totals and at-bat counts while excluding aggregate team lines.
- Sports journalism workflow that automatically extracts, filters, and verifies player performance metrics from archived HTML tables to power weekly “On This Day in 1977 Yankees History” feature articles.
- Academic research project in sports economics that collects walk and at-bat data across seasons by scraping and cleaning historical baseball tables, ensuring only individual player entries are used for regression analysis.
- Sports betting model development where historical player walk rates and at-bat frequencies are programmatically scraped, cleaned, and ranked to serve as predictive features in machine learning algorithms.
- Museum or exhibit interactive display system that dynamically pulls, filters, and ranks 1977 Yankees player statistics from web archives to create player comparison dashboards for visitors.
- Financial data engineering scenario where quarterly earnings tables from corporate filings are scraped, summary rows excluded, and companies ranked by profit margins for investment analysis.
- Healthcare data aggregation tool that scrapes clinical trial outcome tables, filters out aggregate results, and ranks treatment arms by success rates to assist meta-analysts in systematic reviews.

I'm conducting four targeted searches: (1) focusing on the 1971 Chicago White Sox trade involving Tommy McCraw, (2) searching for players with exactly 29 stolen bases in 1970, (3) looking for baseball players with nicknames related to unusual walk styles, and (4) a combined search using multiple keywords. This multi-angle approach should help identify potential candidates who match the specific criteria. The search results are being saved to workspace/baseball_player_search_results.json for detailed analysis in the next iteration. Each search uses multiple backends (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing) to maximize result coverage and includes detailed output showing titles, URLs, and content summaries to help identify relevant information about the target player.",
