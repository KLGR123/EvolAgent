**Timestamp:** 2025-07-28 19:18:46

## Plan Content
```
Search for comprehensive 1977 New York Yankees regular season statistics focusing on individual player walk totals. Target these information sources: (1) Official MLB statistics databases or archives, (2) Baseball-Reference.com historical data for 1977 Yankees roster, (3) Sports statistics websites with detailed seasonal breakdowns, (4) Historical baseball records covering individual player performance metrics. Extract complete batting statistics including walks (BB) and at-bats (AB) for all Yankees players during the 1977 regular season. Identify the player with the highest walk total and record their corresponding at-bat count for verification.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify all Yankees players from 1977 and their walk statistics to find the leader, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate official baseball statistics showing both walks and at-bats for the 1977 season, (4) This directly targets the specific player identification and statistical data required by the TASK

The code systematically processes each suitable table (Tables 1, 2, and 3), extracts player names, walks (BB), and at-bats (AB) from the correct column positions, validates the numeric data, and filters out non-regular players. It then compiles all player statistics, sorts them by walk totals in descending order, and identifies the player with the highest walk count along with their corresponding at-bat total. This completes the PLAN requirements by providing the definitive answer about which 1977 Yankees player had the most walks and their AB count, while also saving comprehensive results for verification.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code ran without errors but produced incorrect results. The script successfully parsed the HTML data and extracted player statistics, but the final answer is fundamentally flawed. The output shows 'Team Totals' with 20 walks and 380 at-bats as the player with the most walks, which is clearly a team summary row, not an individual player. Looking at the actual player data extracted, Roy White appears to have the highest individual walk total at 8 walks with 65 at-bats, followed by Reggie Jackson with 7 walks and 41 at-bats. The extraction logic correctly identified suitable tables and processed the data, but failed to filter out team totals and summary rows. **PLAN** alignment: 80% complete - statistics extracted and processed, but final answer identification needs correction. Recommended fix: Add logic to exclude rows with 'Team', 'Totals', or similar keywords from the final ranking, and ensure the answer reflects the actual individual player with the highest walk count.",

    "description": "Addressing the tester's feedback about the flawed results where 'Team Totals' was incorrectly identified as the player with most walks. The issue was that my extraction logic included team summary rows in the final ranking. I'm now implementing proper filtering to exclude rows containing team totals, summaries, and other non-individual player entries. The code first inspects the previously saved results to understand the problematic data structure, then re-processes the HTML data with enhanced filtering criteria including exclude terms like 'team', 'total', 'average', etc. It also applies reasonable at-bat ranges (20-700) to filter out statistical summaries. This should correctly identify Roy White or another individual Yankees player as having the most walks in 1977, rather than team aggregate statistics. The corrected approach ensures we get the actual individual player answer required by the PLAN.",
