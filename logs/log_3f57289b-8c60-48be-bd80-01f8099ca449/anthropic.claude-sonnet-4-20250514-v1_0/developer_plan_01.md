## Plan Content
```
Search for comprehensive 1977 New York Yankees regular season statistics focusing on individual player walk totals and at-bat counts. Target these specific data sources: (1) Baseball-Reference.com for detailed 1977 Yankees team statistics, (2) Retrosheet.org for historical MLB data, (3) MLB.com official statistics archives, (4) Sports databases like ESPN or Yahoo Sports historical sections. Extract complete batting statistics table including player names, walks (BB), and at-bats (AB) columns for all Yankees players during the 1977 regular season. Identify the player with the highest walk total and record their corresponding at-bat count for that same season.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify 1977 Yankees players' walk and at-bat statistics, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find comprehensive batting statistics showing both walks and at-bats for comparison, (4) This directly targets the specific statistical data needed to answer both parts of the TASK - finding the player with most walks and their at-bat total

This initial step focuses on locating and extracting the batting statistics table containing player names, walks (BB), and at-bats (AB) data. The code includes detailed progress reporting and error handling, saves raw data to workspace for further processing, and prepares for identifying the player with the highest walk total. This approach follows the incremental development strategy by first establishing a reliable data source before moving to data analysis and final answer extraction.',

This addresses the 404 error from the previous attempt. The code implements a robust approach to locate and parse the batting statistics table, with comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies. It systematically searches for the correct table containing player names, walks (BB), and at-bats (AB), then extracts all player data and identifies the player with the most walks along with their corresponding at-bat count. The solution includes detailed progress reporting, saves complete results to workspace, and implements backup plans for alternative data sources (Retrosheet, MLB.com, ESPN) if Baseball-Reference fails. This directly addresses the PLAN requirements to find 1977 Yankees individual player walk totals and at-bat counts.",

    "description": 'Implementing a comprehensive multi-source approach to find 1977 New York Yankees batting statistics after the initial Baseball-Reference and Retrosheet attempts failed. This strategy systematically tries multiple URL patterns for Baseball-Reference (including different team codes and page structures), then falls back to official MLB.com archives, ESPN historical sections, Sports Reference search functionality, and alternative baseball statistics websites like Baseball Almanac and The Baseball Cube. The code includes respectful rate limiting, saves successful pages to workspace for analysis, tracks progress comprehensively, and provides detailed error reporting. This directly addresses the PLAN requirement to target multiple data sources including Baseball-Reference, MLB.com, and ESPN historical sections. Once a working source is found, the saved HTML pages will be analyzed to extract the complete batting statistics table with player names, walks (BB), and at-bats (AB) data.',

The code attempted to systematically try different Baseball-Reference URL formats, then fallback to MLB.com, ESPN, and alternative sources, but failed during the MLB.com section when the Baseball-Reference attempts didn't succeed. From the truncated output, it appears some Baseball-Reference attempts may have returned 404 errors before the code crashed. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no data extraction completed due to the runtime error. The approach of trying multiple URL patterns and sources is correct, but there's a programming error preventing completion. Recommended fix: Check variable scoping in the conditional logic - ensure 'mlb_urls' is defined before being referenced in the except block, or restructure the code to properly handle the multi-source fallback sequence. The systematic approach to trying different sources aligns well with the **PLAN** requirements once the code execution issue is resolved.",

    "description": 'Fixed the variable scoping issue from the previous attempt and implemented a comprehensive, systematic approach to find 1977 New York Yankees batting statistics. The code now properly defines all URL lists upfront to avoid NameError issues, then sequentially attempts multiple data sources as specified in the PLAN: (1) Baseball-Reference with various URL formats and team codes, (2) MLB.com official archives, (3) ESPN historical statistics, and (4) alternative baseball sites like Baseball Almanac and SABR. Once a working source is found, the code immediately analyzes the successful page to locate batting statistics tables, extract player data including names, walks (BB), and at-bats (AB), and identify the player with the highest walk total along with their corresponding at-bat count. The solution includes comprehensive progress reporting, saves all working pages and results to workspace, and provides detailed error handling for the multi-source fallback strategy. This directly addresses the PLAN requirements to search multiple comprehensive data sources and extract individual player walk totals and at-bat counts for the 1977 Yankees regular season.',
