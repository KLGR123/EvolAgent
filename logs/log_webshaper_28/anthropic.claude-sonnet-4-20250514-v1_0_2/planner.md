### First name of the firm that designed the Chicago landmark named for APOD horizon city namesake

**TASK**: During the first week of August 2015, one of the NASA Astronomy Pictures of the Day shows the lights of a city on the horizon. The namesake of this city also has a landmark building in Chicago named after him. What is the name of the architectural firm that designed this landmark building? Give the first name appearing in the name of the firm as of June 2023.

This represents the culmination of 8 phases of research, using enhanced regex patterns to mine every possible Mexican business ownership indicator from the collected HTML files. The code: (1) Reviews the current research status from previous assessment files, (2) Applies 20+ enhanced patterns for Mexican legal structures (S.A. de C.V., Grupo, Corporación), Spanish ownership terms (propietario, dueño, fundador), and English ownership indicators, (3) Conducts specialized pattern matching for CINETOP operations and 2006 TV partnerships, (4) Consolidates all findings with frequency analysis to identify the most credible owner candidate, (5) Provides detailed context and evidence for each finding, (6) Calculates final completion percentage for all PLAN requirements, (7) Saves comprehensive mining results and delivers final research conclusion. This deep analysis will either extract the missing ownership information from our existing dataset or definitively establish that the available travel booking site sources are insufficient for completing the PLAN requirements, necessitating alternative research approaches through Mexican business registries and specialized databases.',

Look for details about Telemundo's broadband license application in Mexico in 2006, their partnership with Grupo Medcom for news operations, and the Noticiero Telemundo Internacional program. This will help identify the Mexican company that partnered with Telemundo and then trace back to find if this company owns Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico and operates CINETOP.",
