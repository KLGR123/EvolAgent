  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the birth country of a gold medalist from FIS Nordic World Ski Championships held in Cortina d'Ampezzo that excluded Finland and Norway participants. Member evaluation reveals three different championship years identified: Member 1 found 1941 (claiming minimal Finland/Norway participation despite Finland winning 3 golds), Member 2 identified 1927 (with no Finnish/Norwegian participants), and Member 3 determined 1940 (cancelled due to WWII). Cross-analysis shows fundamental disagreement on which championship meets the criteria. Member 1's analysis contains logical inconsistency - claiming 1941 had 'minimal' Finland/Norway participation while simultaneously documenting Finland won 3 gold medals, which contradicts the task requirement of no participation. Member 3's approach is methodologically sound but reaches a dead end since the 1940 championship was cancelled with no medals awarded. Member 2 provides the most coherent solution: systematically identified 1927 as the championship with confirmed absence of Finnish/Norwegian participants, conducted thorough biographical research on gold medalists, and definitively established that John Lindgren (Hedlunda, Sweden) and Tore Edman (Arvika, Sweden) were the only gold medalists, both born in Sweden. Synthesis validation: Member 2's findings are internally consistent, historically accurate, and directly answer the task requirements. The 1927 championship represents the only viable solution where the constraint conditions are met and gold medalists exist to identify.",
