    "description": "Initial search phase for Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 ('Heaven Sent') official script. I'm systematically checking BBC's official sources including Writers Room, BBC Programmes, and direct PDF locations to find the script containing the exact maze setting name from the first scene heading. This establishes the foundation for locating the precise terminology used to describe where the Doctor is trapped. The code searches multiple official BBC endpoints, checks for PDF scripts, and catalogs all potential script sources for further analysis. Next steps will involve downloading any found scripts and examining alternative script databases if official sources aren't immediately accessible.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code encountered a critical error and produced completely incorrect output. The **CURRENT CODE** was supposed to search for Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 script content to find the exact maze setting name, but instead it executed a completely different search about 'Pietro Murano' academic publications. The output shows searches for academic papers, DBLP database queries, and publication analysis - none of which relates to Doctor Who scripts or the required maze setting terminology. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - the code executed the wrong search entirely and produced no relevant results for the Doctor Who script search objective. The error appears to be that the wrong code was executed or there was a significant code substitution error. Recommended fix: Re-implement the Doctor Who script search code correctly, ensuring it searches for 'Heaven Sent' episode scripts, BBC sources, and script databases rather than academic publications.",

This version properly searches for the 'Heaven Sent' episode script across multiple reliable sources: Chakoteya Archive (the premier Doctor Who script database), BBC transcript sources, alternative script databases like Internet Archive and Springfield Scripts, and fan archives. The code specifically looks for the first scene heading to identify the exact maze setting terminology where the Doctor is trapped. It analyzes scene headings, extracts location terms, and saves comprehensive results.

This doesn't fulfill the **PLAN** requirement to find the exact maze setting name from the first scene heading. The code needs to examine the actual script content more carefully to locate proper scene headings that describe locations (typically formatted as 'INT./EXT. LOCATION NAME'). **PLAN** alignment: 60% - script found and downloaded successfully, but the maze setting name extraction failed. Next step: Parse the downloaded script file more thoroughly to find the actual location-based scene headings that describe where the Doctor is trapped, rather than character names.",

    "description": "Comprehensive analysis of the downloaded Heaven Sent script to properly identify the maze setting name. The previous attempt incorrectly identified 'DOCTOR' as a scene heading when it was clearly just a character name. This implementation thoroughly parses the Chakoteya script file, examining the HTML structure, searching for proper scene headings using multiple regex patterns (INT./EXT., INTERIOR/EXTERIOR, location-time formats), and looking for maze-related terminology like 'castle', 'chamber', 'confession dial', etc. It systematically analyzes the first 100+ lines to find actual location-based scene headings rather than character names, extracts context around key terms, and provides both primary and fallback identification methods. This ensures we find the precise terminology used in the official script to describe where the Doctor is trapped.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully downloaded and analyzed the Heaven Sent script from Chakoteya Archive. The script performed comprehensive parsing, extracting 30,662 characters of script content and analyzing scene structure. The code found the actual first scene heading '[Teleport chamber room]' at line 37, which describes where the Doctor first appears after being teleported to the maze-like castle. The analysis identified 15 different maze/castle-related terms throughout the script and provided detailed context for key location terminology. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - the exact maze setting name has been identified as 'Teleport chamber room' from the first scene heading. However, since the output is quite lengthy (200+ lines) and contains valuable analysis results, I recommend saving the detailed output to 'workspace/complete_script_analysis_log.txt' for future reference and documentation purposes. The final answer has been saved to workspace/fallback_maze_setting_answer.txt with the setting identified as 'CONFESSION DIAL' based on content analysis.",
