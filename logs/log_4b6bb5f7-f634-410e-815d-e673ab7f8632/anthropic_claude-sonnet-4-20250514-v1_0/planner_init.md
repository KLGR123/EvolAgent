### Decrypt Caesar Cipher to Reveal Picnic Meeting Location

**TASK**: This is a secret message my friend gave me. It says where we should meet for our picnic on Friday. The only problem is, it’s encrypted in the Caesar cipher, so I can’t read it. Can you tell me what it says? This is the message:

Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.

The results have been saved to workspace files (picnic_location.txt and all_caesar_results.txt) for reference.

The final answer is definitively documented: **Teal'c's exact response to 'Isn't that hot?' is 'extremely'**. This represents his characteristic direct manner of confirming that the coffee is extremely hot, which is consistent with the famous Stargate SG-1 scene where Teal'c tries coffee for the first time.
