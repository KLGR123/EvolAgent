I'm systematically checking official BBC sources first (BBC iPlayer, BBC Writersroom, official Doctor Who site), then expanding to known Doctor Who script archives like Chakoteya.net and Fandom transcripts. The code searches for script-related links, downloads promising content, and analyzes it for script indicators like scene headings (INT./EXT.), character names, and location references. I'm specifically looking for the opening scene where the Doctor is trapped in the maze-like structure, which should contain the exact setting name we need. The approach prioritizes official sources while being respectful with request timing, and saves all found content to workspace for detailed analysis in the next iteration.",

However, the primary objective was not achieved - no official Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 scripts were located. The search found 0 script sources despite checking multiple official and archive sites. Several target sites returned 404 or 502 errors, and accessible sites didn't contain direct script links. **PLAN** alignment: 20% - infrastructure working but core objective unmet. The code did save some page content (1.1MB from doctorwho.tv) that may contain useful information. Next steps: (1) Analyze the saved page content in workspace files for any embedded script references or alternative paths to scripts, (2) Try more specific search terms like 'Heaven Sent transcript' or 'confession dial script', (3) Consider searching academic databases, fan sites, or using different URL patterns for the Chakoteya archive which loaded but didn't show Heaven Sent links.",

    "description": "This iteration takes a more targeted approach to finding the Heaven Sent script. I'm first analyzing the existing workspace files (especially the large 1.1MB Doctor Who official site file) to extract any Heaven Sent references or script-related content. Then I'm using more specific URLs including direct links to Chakoteya transcripts, TARDIS Wiki, and other Doctor Who resources. The code searches for script indicators like 'DOCTOR:', 'INT.', scene headings, and specific Heaven Sent terms like 'confession dial' and 'castle'. For any promising content found, I immediately analyze it for opening scene patterns and save context around potential scene headings. This approach is more focused than the previous broad search and should help us locate the exact setting name from the first scene where the Doctor is trapped in the maze-like structure.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and made significant progress toward the **PLAN** objective. The script successfully found and downloaded a Doctor Who Wiki page for Heaven Sent that contains multiple script indicators including 'DOCTOR:', 'confession dial', 'castle', 'teleport', and scene-related content. The code saved a substantial 562KB HTML file with promising content and identified key setting keywords like 'castle', 'confession dial', 'chamber', 'room', 'corridor', 'hall', 'tower', 'prison'. However, the search revealed that most direct transcript sites (Chakoteya, BBC iPlayer) returned 404 errors, suggesting URL changes or access restrictions. **PLAN** alignment: 70% - strong progress with one viable script candidate found. The opening scene context shows 'Inside the Doctor's confession dial' as the main setting, which may be the exact information needed. Next step: Deep analysis of the saved 'heaven_sent_doctor_who_wiki_heaven_sent.html' file to extract the precise scene headings and setting names from the actual script content, focusing on the opening scene where the Doctor first appears in the maze-like structure.",

    "description": "This iteration performs a comprehensive deep analysis of the Heaven Sent HTML file we successfully downloaded from the Doctor Who Wiki. I'm systematically parsing the HTML content to extract the exact setting information from the first scene where the Doctor is trapped in the maze. The code searches for multiple types of content: (1) Plot/synopsis sections that describe the opening scene, (2) Standard script formatting patterns like 'INT.' and 'EXT.' scene headings, (3) Specific references to 'confession dial' and 'castle' with surrounding context, (4) Opening scene descriptions using keywords like 'teaser', 'first scene', 'doctor materializes', and (5) Structured setting information from infoboxes or episode details. Based on the previous iteration's finding of 'Inside the Doctor's confession dial' as the main setting, I'm focusing on extracting the precise scene heading format used in the official script. The analysis creates detailed reports and saves all findings to workspace files for the planner's reference.",
