## Plan Content
```
Search for information from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) about the American Alligator's historical range and specifically when it was first documented west of Texas. Focus on USGS publications, reports, or databases that track species distribution and range expansion of the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis).
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to find official USGS documentation about American Alligator range expansion, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to locate USGS publications or databases with historical records of alligator sightings and range, (4) This directly addresses the core question of when USGS first documented alligators west of Texas
