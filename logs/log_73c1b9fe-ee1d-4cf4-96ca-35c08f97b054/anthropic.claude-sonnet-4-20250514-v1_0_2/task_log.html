The solution correctly identified and listed all six U.S. Secretaries of Homeland Security who served prior to April 2019, excluding those who served in acting capacity only. The final implementation successfully accessed authoritative sources and provided a verified list of secretaries with their term dates, presidents they served under, and additional relevant notes. The data was properly formatted and saved to a JSON file in the workspace directory.

The code identified the six US Secretaries of Homeland Security who served before April 2019 (excluding acting secretaries) and successfully extracted their bachelor&#x27;s degree information.\n\nHere&#x27;s a summary of the results:\n\n1. Tom Ridge: Harvard University (BA)\n2. Michael Chertoff: Harvard University (BA)\n3. Janet Napolitano: Santa Clara University (BS)\n4. Jeh Johnson: Morehouse College (BA)\n5. John F. Kelly: University of Massachusetts Boston (BA)\n6. Kirstjen Nielsen: Georgetown University (BS)\n\nThe final approach used a direct hardcoded list of secretaries since the Wikipedia table parsing proved unreliable. The bachelor&#x27;s degree extraction was improved with more sophisticated pattern matching techniques that successfully identified all degrees.\n\nThe code achieved all the requirements of the PLAN, identifying both the secretaries who served prior to April 2019 and their educational backgrounds with a focus on where they received their bachelor&#x27;s degrees.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &quot;Research the geographic locations of all universities where former US Secretaries of Homeland Security (who served prior to April 2019, excluding acting secretaries) obtained their bachelor&#x27;s degrees. Identify the longitude and latitude coordinates for each university to determine which is the westernmost and which is the easternmost.&quot;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is the optimal next step because: (1) We&#x27;ve already identified all six formal Secretaries and their bachelor&#x27;s degree universities, (2) The previous developer work confirmed these universities as Harvard (Ridge, Chertoff), Santa Clara University, Morehouse College, University of Massachusetts Boston, and Georgetown University, (3) Expected outcome is the geographic coordinates of each university to determine westernmost and easternmost locations, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK requirement of identifying the westernmost and easternmost universities by city location.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;The task has already been successfully completed. Based on the HISTORY, the code has been implemented and executed without any critical errors. The script successfully researched the geographic locations of universities where former US Secretaries of Homeland Security obtained their bachelor\&#x27;s degrees, identified the coordinates for each university, and determined that Santa Clara University (attended by Janet Napolitano) is the westernmost university at longitude -121.936544 and University of Massachusetts Boston (attended by John F. Kelly) is the easternmost university at longitude -71.0387132. All results were properly saved to JSON and CSV files. According to the tester\&#x27;s feedback in the last execution, &quot;The PLAN requirements have been completely met, and no further development is needed.&quot;&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This step is necessary because: (1) We&#x27;ve already identified Santa Clara University as the westernmost university and University of Massachusetts Boston as the easternmost university from previous research, (2) The HISTORY shows we have their coordinates but need to explicitly identify their city locations, (3) Expected outcome is the names of the cities where these universities are located, (4) The TASK specifically requests a comma-separated list of city names rather than university names, with westernmost first.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;Based on the HISTORY, the task has been successfully completed. Through multiple successful script executions, we\&#x27;ve consistently confirmed that Santa Clara University (longitude -121.936544) is the westernmost university and University of Massachusetts Boston (longitude -71.0387132) is the easternmost university.\n\nThe required comma-separated list with the westernmost city first, followed by the easternmost city, is &quot;Santa Clara, Boston&quot;. This result has been properly verified and saved to workspace/university_cities.txt in the most recent execution.\n\nThe PLAN has been fully implemented with the correct result produced and saved to the specified location. No further development is needed as confirmed by the tester\&#x27;s feedback.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. Based on our research, we identified all individuals who formally held the position of United States secretary of homeland security prior to April 2019 (excluding acting secretaries): Tom Ridge, Michael Chertoff, Janet Napolitano, Jeh Johnson, John F. Kelly, and Kirstjen Nielsen. We determined their bachelor&#x27;s degree institutions and locations: Harvard University (Ridge, Chertoff), Santa Clara University (Napolitano), Morehouse College (Johnson), University of Massachusetts Boston (Kelly), and Georgetown University (Nielsen). Geographic coordinate analysis confirmed that Santa Clara University is the westernmost university (longitude -121.936544) located in Santa Clara, and University of Massachusetts Boston is the easternmost university (longitude -71.0387132) located in Boston.

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
================================================================================
1. Examine the most promising USGS official sources first
2. Look for downloadable PDFs, databases, or species distribution maps
3. Search for specific USGS publications mentioned in results
4. Check USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database if referenced
5. Look for historical wildlife survey reports from western states</div></div>

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution partially successful - The code successfully executed API calls and retrieved 56 search results from USGS sources, but encountered a critical bug that prevented proper analysis. The searches found promising USGS official sources including the NAS (Nonindigenous Aquatic Species) database with American Alligator profiles, and snippets show mentions of western states like Arizona, California, and Colorado with specific years (1978, 2009). However, a NameError occurred during result processing: &#x27;name &#x27;title&#x27; is not defined&#x27; in the analysis section, which prevented the scoring and filtering of results. This caused 0 results to be marked as &#x27;highly relevant&#x27; despite clearly relevant content being found. The search data was saved to JSON files, but the analysis is incomplete. **PLAN** alignment: 60% - data collection succeeded but analysis failed. Next step: Fix the variable scope issue in the result analysis loop where &#x27;title&#x27; variable is referenced outside its defined scope, likely in the scoring section around line with historical_terms checking.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully fixed the variable scope issue from the previous attempt. The corrected analysis properly processed the search results and generated a comprehensive analysis. However, the analysis reveals a concerning finding: despite the initial search showing 56 total results with promising USGS sources (including NAS database entries mentioning Arizona, California, Colorado with specific years like 1978, 2009), the corrected analysis found 0 USGS official sources, 0 western state mentions, and 0 promising results. This suggests the original search data may have been corrupted by the previous NameError bug, or the results structure differs from expected format. The code successfully created corrected_usgs_alligator_analysis.json with proper scoring criteria and analysis framework. **PLAN** alignment: 70% - analysis framework is working but no actionable USGS data was extracted. Next step: Examine the raw search results JSON file to verify if the original data contains the promising USGS NAS database entries that were visible in the search output, and debug why they&#x27;re not being captured in the analysis.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully conducted a fresh search that recovered the lost USGS data. The debugging phase correctly identified that the original search results were corrupted by the NameError bug, showing 0 results with error messages instead of actual data. The fresh search successfully retrieved 28 new results across 3 targeted queries, including multiple high-priority USGS NAS (Nonindigenous Aquatic Species) database entries. Key findings: (1) Found official USGS NAS database pages for American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) with species profiles, HUC maps, and collection records, (2) Identified USGS sources mentioning New Mexico and Arizona in alligator distribution context, (3) Located collection records from non-native states like NY and PA, suggesting the NAS database tracks transplanted populations. The fresh search data was saved to &#x27;fresh_usgs_alligator_search.json&#x27; with 28 total results. **PLAN** alignment: 85% - successfully recovered USGS official sources and identified the NAS database as the primary resource for tracking American Alligator distribution west of Texas. Next step: Analyze the fresh search results to extract specific information about western state records, collection dates, and historical documentation from the USGS NAS database entries.

NEXT STEPS FOR FINDING FIRST WESTERN DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================
1. ACCESS USGS NAS DATABASE ENTRIES (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   - Primary species profile: https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=221
     This should contain comprehensive distribution data and collection records
   - Distribution map: https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/speciesmap.aspx?SpeciesID=221
     This should show geographic range including any western state records
   - Collection records: 7 entries found
     These contain specific specimen data with dates and locations

2. LOOK FOR:
   - Collection dates from western states (AZ, CA, CO, NM, NV, UT)
   - &#x27;Transplant&#x27; or &#x27;Non-native&#x27; designations in western locations
   - Earliest documented collection dates west of Texas
   - HUC (Hydrologic Unit Code) maps showing western distributions</div></div>

The analysis successfully processed 28 search results and identified 9 high-priority USGS NAS database entries, including the primary species profile (https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=221) and distribution map (https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/speciesmap.aspx?SpeciesID=221). The code found 8 results mentioning western states (Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico) and 7 collection records with specific specimen data. Importantly, the analysis correctly identified that collection records show &#x27;Native Transplant&#x27; designations, indicating the NAS database tracks non-native populations which is exactly what&#x27;s needed to find when alligators were first documented west of Texas. The comprehensive analysis was saved to &#x27;usgs_alligator_comprehensive_analysis.json&#x27; with detailed categorization. **PLAN** alignment: 95% - successfully identified the key USGS NAS database resources that should contain the specific collection dates and locations for American Alligator records west of Texas. The analysis provides clear next steps to access the species profile and distribution map to find the earliest documented western state records. No further search development needed - the analysis has identified the definitive USGS sources for answering the research question.

NEXT STEPS FOR FINDING FIRST WESTERN DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================
1. ACCESS USGS NAS DATABASE ENTRIES (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   - Primary species profile: https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=221
     This should contain comprehensive distribution data and collection records
   - Distribution map: https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/speciesmap.aspx?SpeciesID=221
     This should show geographic range including any western state records
   - Collection records: 7 entries found
     These contain specific specimen data with dates and locations

2. LOOK FOR:
   - Collection dates from western states (AZ, CA, CO, NM, NV, UT)
   - &#x27;Transplant&#x27; or &#x27;Non-native&#x27; designations in western locations
   - Earliest documented collection dates west of Texas
   - HUC (Hydrologic Unit Code) maps showing western distributions</div></div>

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully accessed the USGS NAS database to extract comprehensive American Alligator distribution data. The code retrieved the species profile page (79,441 bytes) and found crucial information about western states distribution. Key findings include: (1) Found 12 mentions of western states with specific details - Arizona alligators collected from Phoenix with years 1990-2007, California records from 1954-2023 across 9 HUCs including Colorado River collections, and Colorado records from 1978-2009 across 3 HUCs, (2) Discovered a comprehensive data table showing first/last observed dates by state with Arizona (1990-2007), California (1954-2023), and Colorado (1978-2009), (3) Extracted detailed context about transplanted populations including escaped zoo animals and intentionally released specimens, (4) Found 116 year mentions providing historical timeline context. The analysis saved raw HTML, extracted text, and comprehensive JSON analysis files. However, the code encountered a minor error in the links analysis section that didn&#x27;t affect the core data extraction. **PLAN** alignment: 90% - successfully accessed official USGS NAS database and extracted specific western state records with dates, providing clear evidence that American Alligators were first documented west of Texas in California in 1954, followed by Colorado in 1978 and Arizona in 1990. Recommend saving the detailed output to a file for future reference due to the comprehensive nature of the findings.

=== DEFINITIVE ANSWER ===
The American Alligator was FIRST DOCUMENTED west of Texas in:
  STATE: California
  YEAR: 1954
  SOURCE: USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database

=== CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE OF WESTERN DOCUMENTATION ===
1. California: 1954-2023 (9 HUCs)
   Locations: Butte Creek, Imperial Reservoir, Lower American, Lower Sacramento, San Gabriel, San Joaquin Delta, San Pablo Bay, Upper Cache, Upper Calaveras
   Notes: Longest-running western state records, spanning 69 years (1954-2023)

2. Colorado: 1978-2009 (3 HUCs)
   Locations: Colorado Headwaters-Plateau, North Fork Gunnison, St. Vrain
   Notes: Second western state to document American Alligators, 24 years after California

3. Arizona: 1990-2007 (2 HUCs)
   Locations: Lake Mead, Lower Salt
   Notes: Third western state, documented 36 years after California

=== KEY CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION ===
• Species Status: Native Transplant - indicates non-indigenous populations from escaped or released animals
• Establishment: No evidence of established breeding populations in western states
• Native Range: Coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and west to the Texas border

=== SOURCES OF WESTERN POPULATIONS ===
• Escaped zoo animals (Mesa County, Colorado - roadside zoo)
• Released from traveling carnival (Colorado River, California)
• Escaped or deliberately released pets
• Possible intentional introductions by animal dealers

=== SPECIFIC COLLECTION EVIDENCE ===
• California Colorado River: Specimen collected from Colorado River in California, released from traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978)
• Colorado Mesa County: Specimen from Mesa County, Colorado escaped from roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998)
• Arizona Phoenix: Alligators from Phoenix, Arizona were collected (M. Demlong, personal communication 1997)

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully compiled a comprehensive final report on American Alligator distribution west of Texas based on the extracted USGS NAS database data. The code produced a definitive answer: American Alligators were first documented west of Texas in California in 1954, followed by Colorado in 1978 and Arizona in 1990. The analysis includes detailed chronological documentation, specific location data (HUCs), contextual information about transplanted populations, and supporting evidence from official USGS sources. The output provides complete species status information (&#x27;Native Transplant&#x27; indicating non-indigenous populations from escaped/released animals), establishment status (no evidence of breeding populations), and specific collection details with citations. Two comprehensive files were created: a detailed JSON report and a concise summary text file. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the research question has been definitively answered using official USGS records with specific dates, locations, and supporting documentation. The USGS search successfully identified when American Alligators were first documented west of Texas, with California 1954 being the earliest western documentation. No further development is needed as the PLAN objectives have been fully achieved with authoritative federal database sources.

=== DEFINITIVE ANSWER ===
The American Alligator was FIRST DOCUMENTED west of Texas in:
  STATE: California
  YEAR: 1954
  SOURCE: USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database

=== CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE OF WESTERN DOCUMENTATION ===
1. California: 1954-2023 (9 HUCs)
   Locations: Butte Creek, Imperial Reservoir, Lower American, Lower Sacramento, San Gabriel, San Joaquin Delta, San Pablo Bay, Upper Cache, Upper Calaveras
   Notes: Longest-running western state records, spanning 69 years (1954-2023)

2. Colorado: 1978-2009 (3 HUCs)
   Locations: Colorado Headwaters-Plateau, North Fork Gunnison, St. Vrain
   Notes: Second western state to document American Alligators, 24 years after California

3. Arizona: 1990-2007 (2 HUCs)
   Locations: Lake Mead, Lower Salt
   Notes: Third western state, documented 36 years after California

=== KEY CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION ===
• Species Status: Native Transplant - indicates non-indigenous populations from escaped or released animals
• Establishment: No evidence of established breeding populations in western states
• Native Range: Coastal North Carolina south to southern Florida and west to the Texas border

=== SOURCES OF WESTERN POPULATIONS ===
• Escaped zoo animals (Mesa County, Colorado - roadside zoo)
• Released from traveling carnival (Colorado River, California)
• Escaped or deliberately released pets
• Possible intentional introductions by animal dealers

=== SPECIFIC COLLECTION EVIDENCE ===
• California Colorado River: Specimen collected from Colorado River in California, released from traveling carnival (Bury and Luckenbach, 1978)
• Colorado Mesa County: Specimen from Mesa County, Colorado escaped from roadside zoo (Livo et al., 1998)
• Arizona Phoenix: Alligators from Phoenix, Arizona were collected (M. Demlong, personal communication 1997)
