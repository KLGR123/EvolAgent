### Westernmost and Easternmost University Cities of DHS Secretariesâ€™ Bachelor Degrees (Before April 2019)

**TASK**: All of the individuals who formally held the position of United States secretary of homeland security prior to April 2019, excluding those who held the position in an acting capacity, have a bachelor's degree. Of the universities that these bachelor's degrees were from, which is the westernmost university and which is the easternmost university? Give them to me as a comma-separated list, I only want the name of the cities where the universities are located, with the westernmost city listed first.
