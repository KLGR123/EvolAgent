                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                Helen Margaret Spanton<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task decomposition: This complex historical research question required identifying (1) a Suffolk location with 17th century arachnid events, (2) the historical document recording both this event and Irish spectral army apparitions, (3) the connection to M.R. James's 'The Ash Tree', and (4) a notable artist-suffragette from that location. Individual solution evaluation: Member 1 conducted extensive systematic research across 122 files, initially identifying Cicely Hamilton through weighted scoring analysis (100% vs 46.2% for Ethel Smyth), but later definitively concluded with Sylvia Pankhurst based on comprehensive Suffolk connections and dual artist-suffragette credentials. Member 2 performed thorough alternative location analysis, correctly identified Glanvill's 'Saducismus Triumphatus' (1681) as the source document, established Bury St Edmunds as the Suffolk location, and concluded with Sylvia Pankhurst through systematic candidate evaluation. Member 3 executed the most methodologically sound approach: (1) identified 'Saducismus Triumphatus' by Joseph Glanvill (1681) as the historical document containing both Irish spectral army and Suffolk spider/witch trial accounts, (2) established Bury St Edmunds as the specific Suffolk location, (3) discovered Helen Margaret Spanton as a perfect match - born at 16 Abbeygate Street, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, who was both a notable artist and suffragette. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on Glanvill's document and Bury St Edmunds location across all members, but divergence on the final candidate. Resolution assessment: Member 3's identification of Helen Margaret Spanton provides the most precise geographical connection (specific address in Bury St Edmunds) and direct linkage to the historically documented location, while Members 1 and 2's selection of Sylvia Pankhurst, though well-researched, relies on broader Suffolk connections rather than the specific location from the historical source. Integration synthesis: Helen Margaret Spanton represents the optimal solution combining Member 3's precise geographical methodology with the established historical framework confirmed by all members.
