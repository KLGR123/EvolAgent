Write the numbers in plain text if there are some in the title.</p>
<p>Episodic Examples:<br>### Identify weight and adjacent-column swap causing checksum errors in modified ISBN-13 numbers</p>
<p>**TASK**: The following numbers function similarly to ISBN 13 numbers, however, their validation methods are slightly different. Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.</p>

Implement the modified ISBN-13 validation algorithm that uses alternating weights of 1 and an unknown positive integer (less than 10) instead of the standard 1 and 3. Test all possible weight values (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and all possible adjacent column transposition positions (excluding the final column and first three columns as specified).

<p>### Profession of Founder of Mexico City Firm Operating Gran Hotel, CINETOP, and Telemundo Partnership</p>
<p>**TASK**: What is the profession of the person who founded a Mexico City-based company that owns Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico, operates CINETOP, and partnered in 2006 with a television expansion project launched by Telemundo—which sought a broadband license in Mexico that year, partnered with Grupo Medcom for news operations, and operates the news program Noticiero Telemundo Internacional?</p>
<p>```<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Research investigation complete with definitive conclusions on both plan objectives. The comprehensive research successfully gathered and analyzed information from multiple authoritative sources including PitchBook company profiles, official websites, business news archives (LA Times, NY Times, Variety, Orange County Register), LinkedIn profiles, and industry databases. \n\nFINDINGS SUMMARY:\n\n1. CINETOP-Grupo Hunan Connection: ❌ NO CONNECTION FOUND\n   - José Miguel Cuaik Mena confirmed as founder/chairman of Grupo Hunan (restaurant group founded 1993 in Mexico City)\n   - CINETOP confirmed as independent Mexican movie theater chain (50-99 employees, 1M-5M revenue)\n   - Extensive searches found no evidence of ownership or operational connection between Grupo Hunan and CINETOP\n   - Grupo Hunan operates 26 upscale-casual restaurants across 14 brands, focused entirely on restaurant business\n\n2. Telemundo 2006 Mexico Expansion Partner: ✅ PARTNER IDENTIFIED - GRUPO XTRA\n   - Multiple 2006 news sources definitively confirm Telemundo partnered with Grupo Xtra (owned by Mr. Saba)\n   - Partnership specifically aimed at Mexico TV market entry and seeking broadband/broadcasting licenses\n   - Grupo Xtra formally requested broadcasting license with Telemundo in September 2006\n   - This is separate from Grupo Medcom (Serna family), which had earlier Telemundo Internacional connections\n\n3. Cross-Reference Analysis: ❌ NO CROSS-CONNECTION\n   - No evidence that the same Mexico City-based company (Grupo Hunan) was involved in both CINETOP operations and Telemundo partnerships\n   - Telemundo&#x27;s 2006 partner was Grupo Xtra, not Grupo Hunan\n   - The plan&#x27;s hypothesis of a cross-connection is not supported by evidence\n\nMETHODOLOGY: 12 comprehensive search queries across multiple backends (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Yahoo), targeted searches for all key entities, cross-reference analysis, and consultation of authoritative business sources. Research data saved to workspace files including cinetop_telemundo_final_analysis.json and cinetop_telemundo_raw_search_data.txt.\n\nCONCLUSION: Both plan objectives thoroughly investigated with high-confidence definitive results. Grupo Hunan does not operate CINETOP, and Telemundo&#x27;s 2006 Mexico expansion partner for broadband licenses was Grupo Xtra, not Grupo Hunan.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Search for information about the specific Mexico City-based company that simultaneously owns Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico, operates CINETOP cinema chain, and partnered with Telemundo in 2006 for their Mexico television expansion project. The previous research identified that Grupo Hunan owns the hotel but does not operate CINETOP or partner with Telemundo, indicating we need to find a different company that connects all three business activities mentioned in the TASK.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This search is necessary because: (1) The previous research confirmed that Grupo Hunan (José Miguel Cuaik Mena&#x27;s company) owns Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico but found no connection to CINETOP operations or the 2006 Telemundo partnership, (2) The TASK specifically requires finding ONE company that has all three business connections - hotel ownership, CINETOP operations, and Telemundo partnership, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the correct Mexico City-based company that actually connects all three business activities, (4) Once we find this company and its founder, we can determine that person&#x27;s profession to complete the TASK&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;TASK COMPLETED: The search has successfully identified Grupo Xtra as the Mexico City-based company that connects all three business activities mentioned in the original task. Based on comprehensive verification across multiple search strategies, the evidence strongly supports this conclusion:\n\n**CONFIRMED CONNECTIONS (2/3 with high confidence):**\n\n1. **Telemundo Partnership (2006)** - FULLY CONFIRMED:\n   - Multiple sources explicitly state that &quot;NBC Universal\&#x27;s U.S. Hispanic web, Telemundo, has partnered with Mexican holding company Grupo Xtra&quot;\n   - Partnership formed specifically for Mexico television expansion project\n   - Timeline matches the 2006 requirement perfectly\n\n2. **CINETOP Cinema Operations** - FULLY CONFIRMED:\n   - CINETOP was formerly &quot;Xtra Cinemas&quot; (founded 2005)\n   - Direct LinkedIn evidence shows &quot;Grupo Xtra / Xtra Cinemas / Cinetop&quot; connection\n   - Isaac Saba, head of Grupo Xtra, owned movie theaters throughout Mexico\n\n3. **Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico Ownership** - STRONG EVIDENCE FOUND:\n   - Grupo Xtra\&#x27;s official website lists &quot;GRAN HOTEL CIUDAD DE MÉXICO&quot; as &quot;Sin duda, el Hotel mas elegante de la Ciudad de México&quot;\n   - Corporate documents show Grupo Xtra involvement in hotel administration\n   - Isaac Saba\&#x27;s diversified business empire included hospitality sector\n\n**FINAL ANSWER: Grupo Xtra**\n\nThis Mexico City-based holding company, led by billionaire Isaac Saba Raffoul, simultaneously:\n- Owns Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico (evidenced by official corporate listings)\n- Operates CINETOP cinema chain (formerly Xtra Cinemas)\n- Partnered with Telemundo in 2006 for their Mexico television expansion project\n\nThe search methodology was comprehensive, using multiple targeted approaches and cross-referencing findings. While the hotel ownership connection required deeper investigation, the evidence from Grupo Xtra\&#x27;s own corporate materials and administrative involvement provides sufficient confirmation. The company represents a classic diversified Mexican business conglomerate with interests spanning hospitality, entertainment, and media sectors.\n\nAll search results and verification evidence have been saved to workspace files for future reference.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Research the biographical information and professional background of Isaac Saba Raffoul, who has been identified as the head of Grupo Xtra - the Mexico City-based company that owns Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico, operates CINETOP cinema chain, and partnered with Telemundo in 2006. Focus on determining his primary profession or career background to answer the TASK question about what profession the founder has.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is the final step needed because: (1) Previous research successfully identified Grupo Xtra as the Mexico City-based company connecting all three business activities mentioned in the TASK, (2) Isaac Saba Raffoul has been identified as the head/leader of Grupo Xtra, (3) We now need to determine his specific profession to complete the TASK requirement, (4) Expected outcome is to find Isaac Saba Raffoul&#x27;s professional background and provide the answer to what profession the person who founded this diversified business empire has&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The research task has been completed successfully. Based on the tester&#x27;s feedback, the code executed successfully and definitively answered the PLAN question. Key achievements: (1) Successfully loaded and analyzed 10 biographical search results about Isaac Saba Raffoul, (2) Identified profession evidence in 5 relevant sources including the authoritative Wikipedia source, (3) Extracted key quotes confirming he &#x27;was a Mexican businessman of Syrian Jewish descent&#x27;, (4) Performed frequency analysis showing &#x27;businessman&#x27; as the most common profession term (3 mentions vs 1 each for &#x27;tycoon&#x27; and &#x27;magnate&#x27;), (5) Created comprehensive documentation in both JSON and text formats. The research conclusively determined that Isaac Saba Raffoul, founder of Grupo Xtra, was a BUSINESSMAN. This finding is supported by multiple independent sources with high confidence, including Wikipedia as the authoritative source. The task specified in the PLAN - to research his biographical information and determine his primary profession - has been fully completed with definitive results and proper documentation saved to workspace files.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted through the HISTORY: (1) Grupo Xtra was identified as the Mexico City-based company that owns Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico, operates CINETOP cinema chain, and partnered with Telemundo in 2006 for their Mexico television expansion project, (2) Isaac Saba Raffoul was identified as the founder/head of Grupo Xtra, (3) His biographical research conclusively determined his profession through multiple authoritative sources including Wikipedia.

The code created a research log file and established the foundation for the investigation. However, the actual research phase was only planned but not executed - no web searches were performed to find New Mexico episodes, restaurants visited, or information about James Beard Award winner book recommendations. **PLAN** alignment: 20% complete - show identification done but missing the core research components. Next steps: Implement actual web scraping or API calls to search for Cheap Eats episodes featuring New Mexico, identify specific restaurants Ali Khan visited that served New Mexican cuisine, and research any connections to James Beard Award winner recommendations.</p></div>

Successfully identified a specific Albuquerque episode (Season 1, Episode 3, aired April 28, 2016) featuring &#x27;green chile cheeseburger&#x27; and &#x27;carne adovada&#x27; - both New Mexican staple dishes. However, the restaurant name extraction failed due to poor HTML parsing that captured navigation elements instead of actual restaurant names. The search results show promising leads including Papa Felipe&#x27;s restaurant in Albuquerque from KOAT news and TVFoodMaps, but these weren&#x27;t properly analyzed. **PLAN** alignment: 40% complete - episode and cuisine identified but restaurant name and James Beard connection still missing. Next steps: Focus on scraping the Papa Felipe&#x27;s and TVFoodMaps URLs that were found, extract the specific restaurant name that served the New Mexican dishes, then search for James Beard Award winner book recommendations mentioning that restaurant.</p></div>

  Details: In the Sterns’ estimation, the “hot list” of New Mexican restaurants proffering the very best carne adovada in America starts withRancho de Chimayo,whose carne adovada is described as “chunks of meat turned tender from their long marinade and glistening fiery red.” Following in succession are the Ho...
  Details: Dissenting voices tell me one restaurant that belongs on my hot list is Papa Felipe’s.  This Albuquerque institution did make the Sterns listing.  The dynamic duo of dining observed tht  “an unusual version is served at Papa Felipe’s Mexican Restaurant…where the pork is sopped with a marinade of gre...
  Details: Green chile carne adovada is indeed a unique spin on a New Mexico standard, and to the best of my knowledge, Papa Felipe’s is the only restaurant in Albuquerque, if not the entire state, to feature it. When you stop to think about it, why not green chile carne adovada. The preparation process is the...
  Details: Papa Felipe’s Mexican Restaurant &amp; Lounge has been pleasing Albuquerque palates for more than 45 years with chef Larry Gonzales at the helm for much of that time (1983-2021). As with several restaurants in the Land of Enchantment, it straddles the sometimes ambiguous demarcation between New Mexican ...
  Details: For many Albuquerque diners, Papa Felipe’s hasn’t been the same since Larry’s retirement in 2021.  That’s an opinion I’ve heard several times.  While Larry’s outgoing nature and personality will always permeate the restaurant he loved and to which he gave so much of his life, servers have told us no...
  Details: From an experiential perspective, Papa Felipe’s has the look and feel of a Mexican restaurant that belies the New Mexico style stucco exterior. The interior features a combination of whitewash and stucco colored walls with faux adobe half-walls separating the main dining room. A mural of what appear...
  Details: 28 July 2013: While several Duke City restaurants serve excellent renditions of caldo de res, the hearty, satisfying beef soup, not as many restaurants offercaldo de albondigas, another Mexican comfort food favorite often referred to as “Mexican soul food.” Moorish in origin, Caldo de Albondigas was...
  Details: Speaking of “hot lists,” it wasn’t solely Papa Felipe’s carne adovada which the Sterns rated as among America’s best. The green tamale pie was one of three tamale pies beloved enough by the Sterns to praise effusively in their book. About the green tamale pie, they wrote, “Green tamale pie at Papa F...
  Details: 26 February 2017: Traditionalists who love their carne adovada red can have that, too. One of the best ways is in Papa Felipe’sChilaquile Casserole, a brimming bowlful of joy (think Beethoven’s Fifth at every bite). This entree is layer upon layer of luscious carne adovada (red), melted yellow Chedd...
  Details: 28 July 2013: Although Papa Felipe’s isn’t open for breakfast, it does offer one of the very best–and certainly one of the largest–breakfast burritos in Albuquerque. The aptly namedBig Papa Breakfast Burritois constructed from a giant flour tortilla engorged with three scrambled eggs, Papa’s potatoe...

  Details: In its annual Food &amp; Wine issue for 2012,Albuquerque The Magazineawarded Papa Felipe’s New Mexican Restaurant a Hot Plate Award signifying the selection of its Camarones Victor as one of the “most interesting, special and tasty dishes around.” Considering the thousands of potential selections, to be...
  Details: In April, 2016, Papa Felipe’s was one of four Duke City restaurants (along with Tia B’s La Waffleria,Laguna BurgerandRebel Donut) featured on the Cooking Channel. In an episode entitled “Cheap Eats,” host and food blogger Ali Khan had dinner at Papa Felipe’s where he enjoyed a sopaipilla stuffed wit...
  Details: Papa Felipe’s is one of those rare restaurants which defies paradigms and dares to be different with such inventive entrees as carne adovada made with green chile, entrees which are too good to be on any endangered list. Just in case, make sure you try them before it’s too late....

It takes a lot to impress some of those old-timers, none of whom see much substance in the flash and panache of the nouveau restaurants and their pristine veneer and effusive, over-the-top flamboyance. These guys and gals are impressed only by New Mexican food the way their abuelitas prepared it–unadorned, authentic and absolutely wonderful. If you want to evoke their ire, take them to one of the chains. Worse, try sneaking some cumin into their chile. Just how good is Mary &amp; Tito’s?

His near teary-eyed testimony about how much he missed Chope’s was more powerful than a Sunday sermon.   When he kissed the hallowed ground in front of Chope’s, we knew he meant it.  An elderly gentleman recounted the time Chope’s salsa was so hot it made him hiccup for three days.  A middle-aged woman from Las Cruces rhapsodized about Chope’s chile rellenos, her testimony practically eliciting involuntary salivation in the impromptu audience of queued patrons.  Chope’s has had a similar effect on most its guests for six generations. Perhaps the consummate mom-and-pop…2023 James Beard Foundation - &quot;Best Chef - Texas&quot; Semifinalist2024 James Beard Foundation &quot;Best Chef - Texas&quot; Semifinalist2025 James Beard Foundation - &quot;Best Chef - Texas&quot; SemifinalistJames Beard Foundation (JBF) Award Nominees &amp; WinnersMexicanTacosTexasUnited StatesELEMI – El Paso, TexasGil GardunoMarch 8, 2025March 21, 202511:01 PMMy friend Steve Coleman, owner of the well-written and impeccably researched Steve’s Food Blog has become quite a culinary anthropologist.  Not only does he provide his readers with comprehensive reviews of restaurants throughout the fruited plain, he explores the genesis of the foods he writes about.  One of his passions is to define what constitutes El Paso style Mexican cuisine–its provenance and the cultural role that cuisine has played over the generations.  As he’s discovered, El Paso style Mexican style is still evolving and redefining itself.  Some of that has occurred organically as other cultures have influenced dynamic changes.  Evolution has also been forged by the rediscovery of ancient ingredients and cooking techniques, some of which may once have been…2025 - James Beard Foundation Seminfinalist in the &quot;Outstanding Wine and Beverage ProgramMexicanTacosTexasUnited StatesTaconeta – El Paso, TexasGil GardunoMarch 7, 2025March 18, 202512:01 AMThe meme below purports to show where the highest quality of tacos in Texas can be found.    Study the map and you’ll get the impression the meme’s creator believes tacos are “nonexistent” throughout about half of the Lone Star State.  That includes the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex as well as all of West Texas.   Most of what the meme’s creator believes are the Lone Star State’s “best tacos” can be found only in San Antonio and the South Texas Plains as well as in portions of the Texas Hill Country.  A “best tacos” designation is also accorded to the El Paso area. There is, of course, no official sanctioning of this (or any other) Texas Taco Map.  It’s just someone’s…2025 James Beard Foundation &quot;Best Chef - Texas&quot; SemifinalistBarbecueJames Beard Foundation (JBF) Award Nominees &amp; WinnersTexasUnited StatesLeRoy And Lewis Barbecue – Austin, TexasGil GardunoFebruary 20, 2025February 28, 202512:01 AMWhat can you say about a wife who practically pushes her husband out the door so he can gallavant through the Lone Star State in pursuit of barbecue?  That’s precisely what my Kim did.  She didn’t do so out of malice or because she’s tired of me.  Far from it.  We’ve been together for four decades.  There’s no one whose company I enjoy more and it’s mutual.  Throughout my Air Force career, we were stationed far away from family and had only ourselves to rely on.  We’ve grown together both figuratively and literally (mostly me).  While I would love for my Kim to be by my side every moment of every day, she knows I sometimes need to explore culinary…2024 James Beard Foundation &quot;Best Chef - Southwest&quot; SemifinalistAlbuquerqueFine DiningJames Beard Foundation (JBF) Award Nominees &amp; WinnersNew MexicanNew MexicoEx Novo Brewing Co. – Albuquerque, New MexicoGil GardunoJanuary 17, 2025January 18, 202512:01 AM“What if this is the new luxury food?”  That’s the rhetorical question Chef Marc Quiñones posed to diners at New York City’s legendary James Beard House as he introduced his revolutionary New Mexican ranch-inspired menu during a dinner service on September 28, 2024.  He elaborated the goal of his new restaurant gig at Ex Novo Brewing Company in Albuquerque is to make wonderful food approachable, something everyone can enjoy.  Having worked at high-end, fine-dining establishments for nearly two decades, Chef Quiñones is a virtuoso in the art of fine-dining.  Instead of another exorbitantly priced menu beyond the reach of many diners, he created a superb menu centered around the highest quality food at a price point for everyone–served in a…2022 James Beard Foundation - &quot;Best Chef - Southwest&quot; SemifinalistAlbuquerqueBreakfastJames Beard Foundation (JBF) Award Nominees &amp; WinnersNew MexicanNew MexicoMy Moms – Albuquerque, New MexicoGil GardunoDecember 13, 2024December 16, 20245:01 PM“God could not be everywhere, and therefore he made mothers.” —Rudyard Kipling Should you have the pleasure of getting to know Chef Marie Yniguez, even a little, you’ll come away with three absolute certainties.  First, Albuquerque’s arguably most famous celebrity chef is unabashedly herself.  The happy, loving, gregarious person you’ve seen on numerous Food Network culinary competitions doesn’t have a pretentious bone in her body.  She is as genuine and sincere as they come.  Though she left the hardscrabble mining town of Hurley, New Mexico a lifetime ago, she remains a country girl at heart.

Within the walls of Chaco Canyon, construction of multi-level buildings sprung up, some structures accommodating as many as  800 rooms. Not surprisingly, lower walls had to be made massive in order to support heavy stone walls up to five floors high.  It took remarkable planning to locate doors, passageways, kivas and other architectural features.  At five stories high,  Pueblo Bonito was the largest structure and the inspiration for Hotel Chaco’s spectacular venue in Albuquerque’s Sawmill District.

When most of us are done for after only nine or ten hours, he was just starting what he called his “second shift.” Very few of us have the stamina, initiative and especially the passion for what we do to work “half days.” I know restaurateurs for whom half days (or longer) are standard six or seven days a week.

Within the walls of Chaco Canyon, construction of multi-level buildings sprung up, some structures accommodating as many as  800 rooms. Not surprisingly, lower walls had to be made massive in order to support heavy stone walls up to five floors high.  It took remarkable planning to locate doors, passageways, kivas and other architectural features.  At five stories high,  Pueblo Bonito was the largest structure and the inspiration for Hotel Chaco’s spectacular venue in Albuquerque’s Sawmill District.

When most of us are done for after only nine or ten hours, he was just starting what he called his “second shift.” Very few of us have the stamina, initiative and especially the passion for what we do to work “half days.” I know restaurateurs for whom half days (or longer) are standard six or seven days a week.

It takes a lot to impress some of those old-timers, none of whom see much substance in the flash and panache of the nouveau restaurants and their pristine veneer and effusive, over-the-top flamboyance. These guys and gals are impressed only by New Mexican food the way their abuelitas prepared it–unadorned, authentic and absolutely wonderful. If you want to evoke their ire, take them to one of the chains. Worse, try sneaking some cumin into their chile. Just how good is Mary &amp; Tito’s?

His near teary-eyed testimony about how much he missed Chope’s was more powerful than a Sunday sermon.   When he kissed the hallowed ground in front of Chope’s, we knew he meant it.  An elderly gentleman recounted the time Chope’s salsa was so hot it made him hiccup for three days.  A middle-aged woman from Las Cruces rhapsodized about Chope’s chile rellenos, her testimony practically eliciting involuntary salivation in the impromptu audience of queued patrons.  Chope’s has had a similar effect on most its guests for six generations.

                <div class="content-text"><p>Major breakthrough achieved - Code executed successfully and made critical discoveries that significantly advance the **PLAN**. The research confirmed Papa Felipe&#x27;s Mexican Restaurant in Albuquerque as the restaurant Ali Khan visited on Cheap Eats Season 1, Episode 3 (aired April 28, 2016) where he enjoyed New Mexican staples including carne adovada. Most importantly, the code discovered a crucial James Beard Award connection: the nmgastronome.com source revealed that James Beard Award-winning food journalists Jane and Michael Stern published a book entitled &#x27;Five Hundred Things to Eat Before It&#x27;s Too Late&#x27; in 2009, and Papa Felipe&#x27;s was specifically mentioned in this book for their unique green chile carne adovada. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - all major components identified except the final step of extracting the complete book title with numbers in plain text format. The title appears to be &#x27;Five Hundred Things to Eat Before It&#x27;s Too Late&#x27; but needs verification that &#x27;Five Hundred&#x27; is the correct plain text format rather than &#x27;500&#x27;. Next step: Confirm the exact title format and ensure numbers are written as plain text as required by the **PLAN**.</p></div>

  Details: In the Sterns’ estimation, the “hot list” of New Mexican restaurants proffering the very best carne adovada in America starts withRancho de Chimayo,whose carne adovada is described as “chunks of meat turned tender from their long marinade and glistening fiery red.” Following in succession are the Ho...
  Details: Dissenting voices tell me one restaurant that belongs on my hot list is Papa Felipe’s.  This Albuquerque institution did make the Sterns listing.  The dynamic duo of dining observed tht  “an unusual version is served at Papa Felipe’s Mexican Restaurant…where the pork is sopped with a marinade of gre...
  Details: Green chile carne adovada is indeed a unique spin on a New Mexico standard, and to the best of my knowledge, Papa Felipe’s is the only restaurant in Albuquerque, if not the entire state, to feature it. When you stop to think about it, why not green chile carne adovada. The preparation process is the...
  Details: Papa Felipe’s Mexican Restaurant &amp; Lounge has been pleasing Albuquerque palates for more than 45 years with chef Larry Gonzales at the helm for much of that time (1983-2021). As with several restaurants in the Land of Enchantment, it straddles the sometimes ambiguous demarcation between New Mexican ...
  Details: For many Albuquerque diners, Papa Felipe’s hasn’t been the same since Larry’s retirement in 2021.  That’s an opinion I’ve heard several times.  While Larry’s outgoing nature and personality will always permeate the restaurant he loved and to which he gave so much of his life, servers have told us no...
  Details: From an experiential perspective, Papa Felipe’s has the look and feel of a Mexican restaurant that belies the New Mexico style stucco exterior. The interior features a combination of whitewash and stucco colored walls with faux adobe half-walls separating the main dining room. A mural of what appear...
  Details: 28 July 2013: While several Duke City restaurants serve excellent renditions of caldo de res, the hearty, satisfying beef soup, not as many restaurants offercaldo de albondigas, another Mexican comfort food favorite often referred to as “Mexican soul food.” Moorish in origin, Caldo de Albondigas was...
  Details: Speaking of “hot lists,” it wasn’t solely Papa Felipe’s carne adovada which the Sterns rated as among America’s best. The green tamale pie was one of three tamale pies beloved enough by the Sterns to praise effusively in their book. About the green tamale pie, they wrote, “Green tamale pie at Papa F...
  Details: 26 February 2017: Traditionalists who love their carne adovada red can have that, too. One of the best ways is in Papa Felipe’sChilaquile Casserole, a brimming bowlful of joy (think Beethoven’s Fifth at every bite). This entree is layer upon layer of luscious carne adovada (red), melted yellow Chedd...
  Details: 28 July 2013: Although Papa Felipe’s isn’t open for breakfast, it does offer one of the very best–and certainly one of the largest–breakfast burritos in Albuquerque. The aptly namedBig Papa Breakfast Burritois constructed from a giant flour tortilla engorged with three scrambled eggs, Papa’s potatoe...

  Details: In its annual Food &amp; Wine issue for 2012,Albuquerque The Magazineawarded Papa Felipe’s New Mexican Restaurant a Hot Plate Award signifying the selection of its Camarones Victor as one of the “most interesting, special and tasty dishes around.” Considering the thousands of potential selections, to be...
  Details: In April, 2016, Papa Felipe’s was one of four Duke City restaurants (along with Tia B’s La Waffleria,Laguna BurgerandRebel Donut) featured on the Cooking Channel. In an episode entitled “Cheap Eats,” host and food blogger Ali Khan had dinner at Papa Felipe’s where he enjoyed a sopaipilla stuffed wit...
  Details: Papa Felipe’s is one of those rare restaurants which defies paradigms and dares to be different with such inventive entrees as carne adovada made with green chile, entrees which are too good to be on any endangered list. Just in case, make sure you try them before it’s too late....

It takes a lot to impress some of those old-timers, none of whom see much substance in the flash and panache of the nouveau restaurants and their pristine veneer and effusive, over-the-top flamboyance. These guys and gals are impressed only by New Mexican food the way their abuelitas prepared it–unadorned, authentic and absolutely wonderful. If you want to evoke their ire, take them to one of the chains. Worse, try sneaking some cumin into their chile. Just how good is Mary &amp; Tito’s?

His near teary-eyed testimony about how much he missed Chope’s was more powerful than a Sunday sermon.   When he kissed the hallowed ground in front of Chope’s, we knew he meant it.  An elderly gentleman recounted the time Chope’s salsa was so hot it made him hiccup for three days.  A middle-aged woman from Las Cruces rhapsodized about Chope’s chile rellenos, her testimony practically eliciting involuntary salivation in the impromptu audience of queued patrons.  Chope’s has had a similar effect on most its guests for six generations. Perhaps the consummate mom-and-pop…2023 James Beard Foundation - &quot;Best Chef - Texas&quot; Semifinalist2024 James Beard Foundation &quot;Best Chef - Texas&quot; Semifinalist2025 James Beard Foundation - &quot;Best Chef - Texas&quot; SemifinalistJames Beard Foundation (JBF) Award Nominees &amp; WinnersMexicanTacosTexasUnited StatesELEMI – El Paso, TexasGil GardunoMarch 8, 2025March 21, 202511:01 PMMy friend Steve Coleman, owner of the well-written and impeccably researched Steve’s Food Blog has become quite a culinary anthropologist.  Not only does he provide his readers with comprehensive reviews of restaurants throughout the fruited plain, he explores the genesis of the foods he writes about.  One of his passions is to define what constitutes El Paso style Mexican cuisine–its provenance and the cultural role that cuisine has played over the generations.  As he’s discovered, El Paso style Mexican style is still evolving and redefining itself.  Some of that has occurred organically as other cultures have influenced dynamic changes.  Evolution has also been forged by the rediscovery of ancient ingredients and cooking techniques, some of which may once have been…2025 - James Beard Foundation Seminfinalist in the &quot;Outstanding Wine and Beverage ProgramMexicanTacosTexasUnited StatesTaconeta – El Paso, TexasGil GardunoMarch 7, 2025March 18, 202512:01 AMThe meme below purports to show where the highest quality of tacos in Texas can be found.    Study the map and you’ll get the impression the meme’s creator believes tacos are “nonexistent” throughout about half of the Lone Star State.  That includes the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex as well as all of West Texas.   Most of what the meme’s creator believes are the Lone Star State’s “best tacos” can be found only in San Antonio and the South Texas Plains as well as in portions of the Texas Hill Country.  A “best tacos” designation is also accorded to the El Paso area. There is, of course, no official sanctioning of this (or any other) Texas Taco Map.  It’s just someone’s…2025 James Beard Foundation &quot;Best Chef - Texas&quot; SemifinalistBarbecueJames Beard Foundation (JBF) Award Nominees &amp; WinnersTexasUnited StatesLeRoy And Lewis Barbecue – Austin, TexasGil GardunoFebruary 20, 2025February 28, 202512:01 AMWhat can you say about a wife who practically pushes her husband out the door so he can gallavant through the Lone Star State in pursuit of barbecue?  That’s precisely what my Kim did.  She didn’t do so out of malice or because she’s tired of me.  Far from it.  We’ve been together for four decades.  There’s no one whose company I enjoy more and it’s mutual.  Throughout my Air Force career, we were stationed far away from family and had only ourselves to rely on.  We’ve grown together both figuratively and literally (mostly me).  While I would love for my Kim to be by my side every moment of every day, she knows I sometimes need to explore culinary…2024 James Beard Foundation &quot;Best Chef - Southwest&quot; SemifinalistAlbuquerqueFine DiningJames Beard Foundation (JBF) Award Nominees &amp; WinnersNew MexicanNew MexicoEx Novo Brewing Co. – Albuquerque, New MexicoGil GardunoJanuary 17, 2025January 18, 202512:01 AM“What if this is the new luxury food?”  That’s the rhetorical question Chef Marc Quiñones posed to diners at New York City’s legendary James Beard House as he introduced his revolutionary New Mexican ranch-inspired menu during a dinner service on September 28, 2024.  He elaborated the goal of his new restaurant gig at Ex Novo Brewing Company in Albuquerque is to make wonderful food approachable, something everyone can enjoy.  Having worked at high-end, fine-dining establishments for nearly two decades, Chef Quiñones is a virtuoso in the art of fine-dining.  Instead of another exorbitantly priced menu beyond the reach of many diners, he created a superb menu centered around the highest quality food at a price point for everyone–served in a…2022 James Beard Foundation - &quot;Best Chef - Southwest&quot; SemifinalistAlbuquerqueBreakfastJames Beard Foundation (JBF) Award Nominees &amp; WinnersNew MexicanNew MexicoMy Moms – Albuquerque, New MexicoGil GardunoDecember 13, 2024December 16, 20245:01 PM“God could not be everywhere, and therefore he made mothers.” —Rudyard Kipling Should you have the pleasure of getting to know Chef Marie Yniguez, even a little, you’ll come away with three absolute certainties.  First, Albuquerque’s arguably most famous celebrity chef is unabashedly herself.  The happy, loving, gregarious person you’ve seen on numerous Food Network culinary competitions doesn’t have a pretentious bone in her body.  She is as genuine and sincere as they come.  Though she left the hardscrabble mining town of Hurley, New Mexico a lifetime ago, she remains a country girl at heart.

Within the walls of Chaco Canyon, construction of multi-level buildings sprung up, some structures accommodating as many as  800 rooms. Not surprisingly, lower walls had to be made massive in order to support heavy stone walls up to five floors high.  It took remarkable planning to locate doors, passageways, kivas and other architectural features.  At five stories high,  Pueblo Bonito was the largest structure and the inspiration for Hotel Chaco’s spectacular venue in Albuquerque’s Sawmill District.

Within the walls of Chaco Canyon, construction of multi-level buildings sprung up, some structures accommodating as many as  800 rooms. Not surprisingly, lower walls had to be made massive in order to support heavy stone walls up to five floors high.  It took remarkable planning to locate doors, passageways, kivas and other architectural features.  At five stories high,  Pueblo Bonito was the largest structure and the inspiration for Hotel Chaco’s spectacular venue in Albuquerque’s Sawmill District.

It takes a lot to impress some of those old-timers, none of whom see much substance in the flash and panache of the nouveau restaurants and their pristine veneer and effusive, over-the-top flamboyance. These guys and gals are impressed only by New Mexican food the way their abuelitas prepared it–unadorned, authentic and absolutely wonderful. If you want to evoke their ire, take them to one of the chains. Worse, try sneaking some cumin into their chile. Just how good is Mary &amp; Tito’s?

Successfully identified a specific Albuquerque episode (Season 1, Episode 3, aired April 28, 2016) featuring &#x27;green chile cheeseburger&#x27; and &#x27;carne adovada&#x27; - both New Mexican staple dishes. However, the restaurant name extraction failed due to poor HTML parsing that captured navigation elements instead of actual restaurant names. The search results show promising leads including Papa Felipe&#x27;s restaurant in Albuquerque from KOAT news and TVFoodMaps, but these weren&#x27;t properly analyzed. **PLAN** alignment: 40% complete - episode and cuisine identified but restaurant name and James Beard connection still missing. Next steps: Focus on scraping the Papa Felipe&#x27;s and TVFoodMaps URLs that were found, extract the specific restaurant name that served the New Mexican dishes, then search for James Beard Award

This systematic approach should help identify the specific book title that recommended Papa Felipe&#x27;s, which is the final piece needed to complete the PLAN.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Major breakthrough achieved - Code executed successfully and made critical discoveries that significantly advance the **PLAN**. The research confirmed Papa Felipe&#x27;s Mexican Restaurant in Albuquerque as the restaurant Ali Khan visited on Cheap Eats Season 1, Episode 3 (aired April 28, 2016) where he enjoyed New Mexican staples including carne adovada. Most importantly, the code discovered a crucial James Beard Award connection: the nmgastronome.com source revealed that James Beard Award-winning food journalists Jane and Michael Stern published a book entitled &#x27;Five Hundred Things to Eat Before It&#x27;s Too Late&#x27; in 2009, and Papa Felipe&#x27;s was specifically mentioned in this book for their unique green chile carne adovada. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - all major components identified except the final step of extracting the complete book title with numbers in plain text format. The title appears to be &#x27;Five Hundred Things to Eat Before It&#x27;s Too Late&#x27; but needs verification that &#x27;Five Hundred&#x27; is the correct plain text format rather than &#x27;500&#x27;. Next step: Confirm the exact title format and ensure numbers are written as plain text as required by the **PLAN**.&quot;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &#x27;Code Output: \n\n=== ANALYZING PREVIOUS RESEARCH FINDINGS ===\nPrevious research structure:\n  show_name: &lt;class \&#x27;str\&#x27;&gt;\n  host: &lt;class \&#x27;str\&#x27;&gt;\n  start_year: &lt;class \&#x27;int\&#x27;&gt;\n  network: &lt;class \&#x27;str\&#x27;&gt;\n  focus: &lt;class \&#x27;str\&#x27;&gt;\n  new_mexico_episodes: &lt;class \&#x27;list\&#x27;&gt;\n  restaurants_visited: &lt;class \&#x27;list\&#x27;&gt;\n  search_queries_attempted: &lt;class \&#x27;list\&#x27;&gt;\n  search_results: &lt;class \&#x27;list\&#x27;&gt;\n    Found 15 search results\n    PAPA FELIPE\&#x27;S RESULT: Albuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking Channel - https://www.koat.com/article/albuquerque-s-papa-felipe-s-to-be-featured-on-cooking-channel/5070993\n    PAPA FELIPE\&#x27;S RESULT: Papa Felipe\&#x27;s Mexican Restaurant - Albuquerque, New Mexico - https://www.nmgastronome.com/?p=4572\n  episode_info: &lt;class \&#x27;list\&#x27;&gt;\n  potential_restaurants: &lt;class \&#x27;list\&#x27;&gt;\n  queries_performed: &lt;class \&#x27;list\&#x27;&gt;\n\n=== CONFIRMED EPISODE DETAILS ===\nshow: Cheap Eats\nseason: 1\nepisode: 3\nlocation: Albuquerque, New Mexico\nair_date: April 28, 2016\nnew_mexican_dishes: [\&#x27;green chile cheeseburger\&#x27;, \&#x27;carne adovada\&#x27;]\nsuspected_restaurant: Papa Felipe\&#x27;s\n\n=== RESEARCHING PAPA FELIPE\&#x27;S RESTAURANT ===\nAnalyzing: https://www.koat.com/article/albuquerque-s-papa-felipe-s-to-be-featured-on-cooking-channel/5070993\n  ✓ CONFIRMED: Papa Felipe\&#x27;s was featured on Cheap Eats\n  Details: Skip to contentNOWCASTKOAT Action 7 News at 6pmWatch on DemandMenuSearchHomepageLocal NewsNational NewsPoliticsGet the FactsMatter of FactVery LocalTarget 7WeatherRadarAlertsForecasting Our FutureClosingsZozobraCelebrate NMSportsHigh School FootballAs Seen on 7Project CommUNITYAuto AmbushKOATs for K...\n  Details: AdvertisementAlbuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelPapa Felipe\&#x27;sSOURCE: Papa Felipe\&#x27;sUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘAdvertisementAlbuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘPapa Felipe’...\n  Details: Albuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelPapa Felipe\&#x27;sSOURCE: Papa Felipe\&#x27;sUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘAdvertisementAlbuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘPapa Felipe’s Mexican Res...\n  Details: Albuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelPapa Felipe\&#x27;sSOURCE: Papa Felipe\&#x27;sUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘAdvertisementAlbuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘPapa Felipe’s Mexican Res...\n  Details: Albuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelPapa Felipe\&#x27;sSOURCE: Papa Felipe\&#x27;sUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘAdvertisementAlbuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘPapa Felipe’s Mexican Res...\n  Details: Albuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelPapa Felipe\&#x27;sSOURCE: Papa Felipe\&#x27;sUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘAdvertisementAlbuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘPapa Felipe’s Mexican Res...\n  Details: Albuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking Channel...\n  Details: Papa Felipe\&#x27;sSOURCE: Papa Felipe\&#x27;sUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘAdvertisementAlbuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘPapa Felipe’s Mexican Restaurant will be featured in the Albuquerque episode of &quot;Cheap...\n  Details: Papa Felipe\&#x27;sSOURCE: Papa Felipe\&#x27;sUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘAdvertisementAlbuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘPapa Felipe’s Mexican Restaurant will be featured in the Albuquerque episode of &quot;Cheap...\n  Details: AdvertisementAlbuquerque\&#x27;s Papa Felipe\&#x27;s to be featured on Cooking ChannelUpdated: 1:05 PM MDT Apr 20, 2016Editorial StandardsⓘPapa Felipe’s Mexican Restaurant will be featured in the Albuquerque episode of &quot;Cheap Eats&quot; on the Cooking Channel.

It takes a lot to impress some of those old-timers, none of whom see much substance in the flash and panache of the nouveau restaurants and their pristine veneer and effusive, over-the-top flamboyance. These guys and gals are impressed only by New Mexican food the way their abuelitas prepared it–unadorned, authentic and absolutely wonderful.
