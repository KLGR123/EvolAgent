    "feedback": "Major breakthrough achieved - Code executed successfully and made critical discoveries that significantly advance the **PLAN**. The research confirmed Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant in Albuquerque as the restaurant Ali Khan visited on Cheap Eats Season 1, Episode 3 (aired April 28, 2016) where he enjoyed New Mexican staples including carne adovada. Most importantly, the code discovered a crucial James Beard Award connection: the nmgastronome.com source revealed that James Beard Award-winning food journalists Jane and Michael Stern published a book entitled 'Five Hundred Things to Eat Before It's Too Late' in 2009, and Papa Felipe's was specifically mentioned in this book for their unique green chile carne adovada. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - all major components identified except the final step of extracting the complete book title with numbers in plain text format. The title appears to be 'Five Hundred Things to Eat Before It's Too Late' but needs verification that 'Five Hundred' is the correct plain text format rather than '500'. Next step: Confirm the exact title format and ensure numbers are written as plain text as required by the **PLAN**.",

It takes a lot to impress some of those old-timers, none of whom see much substance in the flash and panache of the nouveau restaurants and their pristine veneer and effusive, over-the-top flamboyance. These guys and gals are impressed only by New Mexican food the way their abuelitas prepared it–unadorned, authentic and absolutely wonderful. If you want to evoke their ire, take them to one of the chains. Worse, try sneaking some cumin into their chile. Just how good is Mary & Tito’s?

When most of us are done for after only nine or ten hours, he was just starting what he called his “second shift.” Very few of us have the stamina, initiative and especially the passion for what we do to work “half days.” I know restaurateurs for whom half days (or longer) are standard six or seven days a week.

His near teary-eyed testimony about how much he missed Chope’s was more powerful than a Sunday sermon.\xa0\xa0 When he kissed the hallowed ground in front of Chope’s, we knew he meant it.\xa0 An elderly gentleman recounted the time Chope’s salsa was so hot it made him hiccup for three days.\xa0 A middle-aged woman from Las Cruces rhapsodized about Chope’s chile rellenos, her testimony practically eliciting involuntary salivation in the impromptu audience of queued patrons.\xa0 Chope’s has had a similar effect on most its guests for six generations.

When most of us are done for after only nine or ten hours, he was just starting what he called his “second shift.” Very few of us have the stamina, initiative and especially the passion for what we do to work “half days.” I know restaurateurs for whom half days (or longer) are standard six or seven days a week.

Based on the breakthrough discovery from the nmgastronome.com source, I've identified that James Beard Award-winning food journalists Jane and Michael Stern published '500 Things to Eat Before It's Too Late' in 2009, which mentioned Papa Felipe's for their unique green chile carne adovada. Since the PLAN specifically requires numbers in plain text format, I'm converting '500' to 'Five Hundred' to get the final answer: 'Five Hundred Things to Eat Before It's Too Late'. This completes all components of the research: Ali Khan's cost-conscious show (Cheap Eats, 2015), New Mexico episode (Season 1 Episode 3, Albuquerque), restaurant serving New Mexican staples (Papa Felipe's with green chile cheeseburger and carne adovada), and the James Beard Award winner book recommendation with the complete title in the required format.",
