# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for information about Ali Khan's cost-conscious TV show that started in 2015, focusing on identifying the show name and episodes where he featured New Mexican cuisine. Look for specific episodes where he visited restaurants in New Mexico or tried New Mexican staples, and identify which restaurant he visited that was later recommended by James Beard Award winners in a book.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify Ali Khan's 2015 TV show and find episodes featuring New Mexican cuisine to locate the specific restaurant visit, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the show name, relevant episodes, and the restaurant where he enjoyed New Mexican food, (4) This establishes the foundation for finding the book where James Beard Award winners recommended that same restaurant
