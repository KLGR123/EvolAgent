  "reason": "Task decomposition: The problem requires identifying the first name of the unique Malko Competition recipient from the 20th Century (after 1977) whose recorded nationality is from a country that no longer exists. This necessitates comprehensive research of competition winners, nationality verification, and temporal filtering. All three members demonstrated strong analytical approaches: Member 1 conducted the most comprehensive research across 36 total winners (1978-2000), creating systematic databases from official sources including malkocompetition.dk and implementing thorough verification processes. Member 2 employed efficient targeted extraction from Wikipedia, creating structured CSV datasets with precise filtering methodology for defunct countries. Member 3 conducted focused research identifying 13 winners across 10 competition years with detailed documentation and verification protocols. Convergence analysis reveals perfect agreement across all members: each independently identified Claus Peter Flor from East Germany as the 1983 winner meeting the criteria. Cross-verification confirms: (1) East Germany (GDR) dissolved in 1990, qualifying as a non-existent country, (2) 1983 falls within the specified post-1977 timeframe, (3) systematic searches across multiple sources consistently identify this as the only qualifying recipient. Integration synthesis: All methodologies validate the same conclusion through different research paths - Member 1's comprehensive database approach, Member 2's structured filtering, and Member 3's focused verification all converge on identical results. Final validation confirms Claus Peter Flor as definitively the only recipient meeting all specified criteria, with 'Claus' as the requested first name extraction.",
