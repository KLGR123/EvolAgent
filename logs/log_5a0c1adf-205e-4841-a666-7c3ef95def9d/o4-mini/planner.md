### 1977 Yankees Player with Most Walks: Season At-Bats

**TASK**: How many at bats did the Yankee with the most walks in the 1977 regular season have that same season?

```

    "plan": 'Search for comprehensive 1977 New York Yankees regular season statistics focusing on individual player walk totals. Target these information sources: (1) Official MLB statistics databases or archives, (2) Baseball-Reference.com historical data for 1977 Yankees roster, (3) Sports statistics websites with detailed seasonal breakdowns, (4) Historical baseball records covering individual player performance metrics. Extract complete batting statistics including walks (BB) and at-bats (AB) for all Yankees players during the 1977 regular season. Identify the player with the highest walk total and record their corresponding at-bat count for verification.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify all Yankees players from 1977 and their walk statistics to find the leader, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate official baseball statistics showing both walks and at-bats for the 1977 season, (4) This directly targets the specific player identification and statistical data required by the TASK',

The task required searching for 1977 New York Yankees regular season statistics to identify the player with the highest walk total and their corresponding at-bat count. Through systematic development across multiple iterations:\n\n**Execution Summary:**\n1. **Data Source Access**: Successfully accessed Baseball-Reference.com's 1977 Yankees team page (HTTP 200) and saved raw HTML data to workspace/baseball_reference_1977_yankees.html\n\n2. **Data Structure Analysis**: Analyzed the HTML structure, identified 4 batting statistics tables, and determined column indices for player names, walks (BB), and at-bats (AB)\n\n3. **Initial Extraction**: Extracted player statistics but encountered the critical issue of including 'Team Totals' as the top result instead of individual players\n\n4. **Corrected Implementation**: Applied enhanced filtering logic to exclude team summary rows using exclude terms ['team', 'total', 'totals', 'average', 'avg', 'league', 'al', 'nl', 'summary'] and reasonable at-bat ranges (20-700)\n\n**Final Answer Achieved:**\n- **Player with Most Walks**: Reggie Jackson*\n- **Walks (BB)**: 5\n- **At-Bats (AB)**: 36\n\n**Files Created in workspace/:**\n- baseball_reference_1977_yankees.html (raw HTML data)\n- baseball_reference_analysis.json (initial table structure analysis)\n- baseball_reference_analysis_updated.json (column indices mapping)\n- 1977_yankees_walk_leaders.json (initial results with team totals issue)\n- 1977_yankees_corrected_walk_leaders.json (final corrected results)\n\n**Verification Methods:**\n- Cross-referenced multiple batting statistics tables\n- Applied data validation and filtering criteria\n- Excluded non-individual player entries (team totals, summaries)\n- Ranked all individual players by walk totals for verification\n\nThe tester confirmed 100% PLAN completion with the definitive identification of Reggie Jackson as the 1977 Yankees player with the most walks (5 BB, 36 AB), sourced from authoritative Baseball-Reference historical data. All PLAN objectives have been satisfied: comprehensive statistics search completed, official data sources accessed, individual player walk totals extracted, highest walk player identified with corresponding at-bat count recorded.",

### Title: Find the non-tautological equivalence among six logical biconditionals

The one that doesn’t fit is:
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)

**TASK**: ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B)
¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B)
(A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A)
(A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B)
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)
¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B)

Which of the above is not logically equivalent to the rest? Provide the full statement that doesn't fit.

    "description": "This is the optimal approach because: (1) The task requires identifying logical non-equivalence among biconditional statements, (2) No previous analysis exists, (3) Expected outcome is to systematically verify each biconditional and identify the false one, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to find the statement that doesn't represent a logical equivalence",

(2) One statement is NOT equivalent: Statement 5: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B) - this is the statement that contains sides which are not equivalent to each other. The analysis used proper truth tables with all possible combinations (TT, TF, FT, FF) and verified established logical laws including De Morgan's Laws, Contrapositive rule, and Implication equivalences. Detailed results were saved to workspace/logical_equivalence_analysis.json. The PLAN objective has been fully achieved - all six statements were systematically evaluated and the non-equivalent statement was successfully identified. No further development is required.",

Based on the comprehensive logical equivalence analysis conducted by the developer using truth tables for all possible combinations of A and B values (TT, TF, FT, FF), the results show that five of the six statements are valid logical equivalences, while one is not. The statement that is NOT logically equivalent to the rest is: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B). This biconditional statement is false because the left side (¬A → B) and right side (A ∨ ¬B) do not have the same truth values across all possible input combinations. Final answer: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)',

### Determine missing edge piece’s two colors in jumbled Rubik’s Cube puzzle

**TASK**: A standard Rubik’s cube has been broken into cubes making up its sides. The cubes are jumbled, and one is removed. There are 6 cubes with one colored face, 12 edge cubes with two colored faces, and 8 corner cubes with three colored faces. All blue cubes have been found. All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube. The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow. For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found. The removed cube has two colors on its faces. What are they? Answer using a comma separated list, with the colors ordered alphabetically.

Then work through each constraint: (1) All blue cubes found, (2) All cubes adjacent to orange center found plus orange center itself, (3) All green corners found, (4) All green that borders yellow found, (5) For all found orange cubes, their opposite face cubes are also found.
