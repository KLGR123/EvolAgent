## Plan Content
```
Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to establish the complete list of Malko Competition recipients from the specified time period, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to identify all winners from 1978-2000 with their nationality records, (4) This directly targets the specific competition and time frame required to find the recipient from a non-existent country

This initial phase focuses on discovering and accessing official sources, competition websites, and archives. I'm systematically testing multiple potential URLs for the competition's official presence, then analyzing successful responses for winner information. The code includes detailed content analysis to identify sources containing winner lists, years, and nationality data - especially focusing on historical countries that no longer exist like USSR, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. Each successful source is saved locally for deeper analysis, and I'm creating structured analysis files to track which sources contain the most relevant winner information.

    "description": "Executing Phase 3 of the PLAN by parsing the Wikipedia HTML content to extract specific Malko Competition winner data from 1978-2000. My approach systematically analyzes all tables in the Wikipedia page to identify those containing winner information, then extracts detailed data including names, years, and nationality information. I'm specifically focusing on identifying winners from historical countries that no longer exist (USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.) as highlighted in the PLAN. The code examines table headers and content to locate winner tables, processes each row to find entries within the target year range (1978-2000), and uses pattern matching to extract potential winner names and country affiliations. This comprehensive extraction addresses the core PLAN requirement of compiling a systematic list of post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information, particularly emphasizing those from defunct countries.",

The script successfully extracted 13 winner entries from the Wikipedia page covering 10 years (1980-1998) within the target period. Key findings: (1) Successfully identified winner table with Year, Recipient, Lifetime, and Country columns, (2) Extracted specific winner names and nationalities including one historical country (East Germany - Claus Peter in 1983), (3) Saved complete results to 'malko_winners_1978_2000.json' file. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - successfully extracted winner names, years, and nationality data from the target period (1978-2000), with special attention to historical countries. Missing elements: Some years in the target range (1978-1979, 1981, 1984-1985, 1988, 1991, 1996-1997, 1999-2000) may not have had competitions or winners. The extraction has successfully identified the core winner data including one recipient from East Germany (a historical country that no longer exists). Consider saving the detailed output to a separate summary file for easier reference, but the main **PLAN** objective of systematically listing post-1977 20th century winners with nationality information has been substantially achieved.",

Following the reminder, I first inspect the saved JSON results file structure to understand its format before processing the data. The code systematically analyzes the extracted winner information, organizes it by year, and provides special focus on winners from historical countries that no longer exist (USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). I'm creating both a detailed year-by-year breakdown and statistical analysis including nationality distribution, missing years, and data completeness percentage. The final summary addresses all PLAN requirements: (1) comprehensive information about Malko Competition recipients, (2) focus on post-1977 20th century period, (3) complete recipient data with names, years, and nationalities, (4) special attention to historical countries that no longer exist, and (5) systematic compilation for further analysis.
