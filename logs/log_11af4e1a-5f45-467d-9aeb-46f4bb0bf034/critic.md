## Final Answer
```
6
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Determine the numerical difference between encoder layer counts in BERT base versus the original Transformer architecture from 'Attention is All You Need' paper. All three team members conducted systematic research approaches with comprehensive verification. Member 1 evaluation: Executed detailed sequential planning with extensive search methodology, used multiple targeted queries (50 total results), created systematic documentation, and verified BERT base has 12 encoder layers and original Transformer has 6 layers through pattern matching and statistical analysis. Demonstrated exceptional thoroughness and methodological rigor. Member 2 evaluation: Provided direct, concise answer without showing research methodology but reached correct conclusion that BERT base (12 layers) minus original Transformer (6 layers) equals 6. Accurate but lacking analytical depth. Member 3 evaluation: Implemented structured approach starting with original paper verification, successfully downloaded and analyzed the actual 'Attention is All You Need' PDF using multiple regex patterns, confirmed 6 encoder layers (N=6), then systematically researched BERT specifications finding 12 layers. Strong technical execution with direct source analysis. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: all members identified BERT base = 12 layers, original Transformer = 6 layers, difference = 6. No contradictions found. Synthesis assessment: Multiple independent verification paths (literature search, PDF analysis, pattern matching, statistical analysis) all confirm identical results. Final validation: 12 - 6 = 6 more encoder blocks in BERT base than original Transformer architecture. Confidence level: very high based on consistent findings across authoritative sources.
