We first wrote a script that accessed specific versions of Wikipedia pages for \'The Lord of the Rings\' and \'A Song of Ice and Fire\' as they appeared on July 3, 2023. The script used the MediaWiki API to retrieve revision IDs from June 29 and June 30, which were the current versions on the target date.\n\n2. We downloaded the complete HTML content of both Wikipedia articles with their specific historical versions and saved them to the workspace directory for analysis.\n\n3. We extracted and analyzed navigation paths between these two articles by:\n   - Identifying direct links (found that ASOIAF links directly to LOTR, but not vice versa)\n   - Finding 16 common links that could serve as intermediate navigation paths\n   - Categorizing these common links into meaningful groups like "Genres", "Authors", etc.\n\n4. We created a visualization of the navigation paths using NetworkX and Matplotlib, which clearly showed the connection structure between the two articles including direct links and common intermediate pages.\n\n5. We generated comprehensive documentation of our findings in a JSON file and provided a detailed summary report.\n\nThe implementation fully met the requirements specified in the PLAN to search for specific historical versions of these Wikipedia pages and analyze potential navigation paths between them. According to the tester\'s feedback, all code executed correctly and produced the expected outputs.',
