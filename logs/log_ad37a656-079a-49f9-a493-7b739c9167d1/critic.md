## Final Answer
```
Bravo
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the catastrophe from July 15, 2008 Phys.org article, find its explosive force per Encyclopedia Britannica, match to US nuclear test yield, and extract the last word of the test name. All three members demonstrated systematic and thorough approaches with identical final conclusions. Member 1 executed comprehensive web searches with proper error handling, successfully accessing the Phys.org article content despite HTTP protection, and methodically progressed through each research phase. Member 2 employed targeted search strategies with effective query formulation, achieving consistent results across multiple verification attempts, and maintained detailed documentation throughout. Member 3 conducted the most rigorous analysis with extensive cross-referencing across 35+ Britannica sources and comprehensive evidence validation. Convergence analysis: All members independently identified (1) Tunguska catastrophe as the July 2008 Phys.org subject, (2) 15 megatons TNT equivalent as Britannica's explosive force measurement, (3) Castle Bravo as the matching US nuclear test, and (4) 'Bravo' as the final answer. Cross-validation confirms: Tunguska event occurred 1908 in Siberia, Encyclopedia Britannica consistently states 15-megaton yield across multiple articles, Castle Bravo conducted March 1, 1954 at Bikini Atoll with exactly 15-megaton yield, making it the definitive match. No contradictions found between approaches - all evidence points to same conclusion. Final answer 'Bravo' represents the last word of 'Castle Bravo' as required by task specifications.
