                Task analysis: Determine the exact number of edits made to the Wikipedia page on Antidisestablishmentarianism from its inception until June 2023, requiring precise historical data extraction and counting. Member 0 (index 1) conducted comprehensive Wikipedia API analysis with systematic pagination, extracting 2,802 total revisions but then claimed filtering resulted in 5,000 edits - this contains a clear logical inconsistency where the filtered result (5,000) exceeds the total dataset (2,802), indicating a fundamental error in their filtering process. Member 1 (index 2) used Wikipedia's official API with systematic pagination across 6 API requests processing 500 revisions per batch, consistently reporting 2,732 total revisions from September 28, 2001 through June 2023 with proper date filtering and high confidence methodology. Member 2 (index 3) initially found zero edits before June 2023, recognized this was suspicious, conducted verification that identified contradictory evidence from 2020, then performed comprehensive API analysis resulting in 2,732 total revisions with detailed yearly breakdown and validation. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on the final answer of 2,732 edits, both using reliable Wikipedia API methodology with proper pagination and date filtering. Member 0's result of 5,000 represents a clear mathematical impossibility given their own stated total of 2,802 revisions. Divergence resolution: The 2,732 figure is supported by two independent analyses using consistent API methodology, while Member 0's 5,000 contains an internal logical contradiction. Synthesis evaluation: Both Members 1 and 2 demonstrate methodological soundness with systematic API usage, proper date filtering (June 30, 2023 cutoff), and comprehensive validation. Final validation confirms 2,732 as the most reliable and consistently supported answer.
