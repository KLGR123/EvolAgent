The species is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List.\n\n**Measurement Type Confirmation**: The data explicitly states "specimens" indicating individual penguins rather than breeding pairs, which directly addresses the PLAN requirement to note whether the figure represents breeding pairs or individual penguins.\n\n**Research Process Summary**:\n1. Conducted systematic Google searches targeting Wikipedia pages with chinstrap penguin population data\n2. Identified 39 total search results across 4 targeted queries\n3. Located the primary Wikipedia page "Chinstrap penguin" containing the target information\n4. Fetched and parsed the HTML content using multiple extraction methods\n5.

    "plan": "Access the complete revision history of the Wikipedia page on 'Antidisestablishmentarianism' using Wikipedia's API or revision history interface to systematically count all edits from the page's creation date through the end of June 2023. Extract the total number of revisions within this timeframe, ensuring accurate date filtering and comprehensive coverage of the edit history data.",
    "description": 'This is the necessary next step because: (1) The previous verification confirmed that the page does have edit history before June 2023, dating back to at least July 2020, contradicting the initial zero-edit finding, (2) We now need to obtain the complete and accurate count of all edits from inception through June 2023, (3) Expected outcome is the definitive total number of edits made to the Antidisestablishmentarianism Wikipedia page during the specified period, (4) This will provide the final answer to the TASK by systematically counting all revisions within the correct timeframe using reliable Wikipedia data sources.',
