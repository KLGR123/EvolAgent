## Final Answer
```
31806
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Convert Mesopotamian/Babylonian cuneiform symbols 𒐜 𒐐𒐚 to decimal using the sexagesimal (base-60) system with proper positional notation. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 identified symbols as 𒐜=8, 𒐐=50, 𒐚=6, calculating 8×3600 + 50×60 + 6×1 = 31,806 with systematic constraint mapping and clear step-by-step validation. Member 2 identified symbols as 𒐜=7, 𒐐=60, 𒐚=5, calculating 7×60² + 60×60¹ + 5×60⁰ = 28,805 using multiple interpretation methods but with inconsistent symbol identification. Member 3 identified symbols as 𒐜=8, 𒐐=60, 𒐚=6, calculating 8×3600 + 60×60 + 6×1 = 32,406 with comprehensive historical research but incorrect treatment of middle symbol. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on base-60 system understanding but divergence in individual symbol values. Critical evaluation: Member 1's interpretation shows strongest methodological rigor by correctly identifying 𒐐 as representing 50 (five corner wedges in tens position) rather than treating it as a positional 60 unit. Member 1's systematic approach with proper cuneiform Unicode analysis and verification against standard Babylonian numeral systems demonstrates highest reliability. Synthesis validation: Member 1's symbol identification aligns with established cuneiform digit representations where 𒐐 represents the value 50, not a positional placeholder. Final answer 31,806 represents the most accurate conversion based on correct symbol interpretation and rigorous positional calculation.
