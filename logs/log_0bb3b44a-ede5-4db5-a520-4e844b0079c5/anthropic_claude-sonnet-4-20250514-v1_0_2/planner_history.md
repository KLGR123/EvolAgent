    "plan": 'Research and analyze the Mesopotamian/Babylonian cuneiform number system to decode the symbols 𒐜  𒐐𒐚. Search for comprehensive information about Babylonian sexagesimal (base-60) numeration, including the meaning of individual cuneiform symbols used for numerical representation. Focus on identifying the specific values of the wedge-shaped symbols 𒐜, 𒐐, and 𒐚, understanding their positional notation system, and determining how they combine to form the complete decimal equivalent.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the Mesopotamian/Babylonian numerical system and identify the specific cuneiform symbols before conversion, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this ancient numbering system, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the symbolic values and positional rules needed for accurate decimal conversion, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK requirement of converting ancient cuneiform numerals to modern Arabic decimal format',

    "description": 'The PLAN has been successfully completed. The previous analysis comprehensively decoded the Babylonian cuneiform symbols 𒐜  𒐐𒐚 and determined their decimal equivalent. Key findings: (1) Successfully identified individual symbol values using standard Babylonian cuneiform numerical notation: 𒐜=8, 𒐐=20, 𒐚=6, (2) Applied proper sexagesimal (base-60) positional notation mathematics to calculate the decimal equivalent, (3) Provided two valid interpretations based on the spacing: single number = 30006, or two separate numbers = 8 and 1206, (4) Created comprehensive documentation explaining the Babylonian numerical system, Unicode analysis, step-by-step calculations, and verification methods, (5) Saved all research data to workspace/babylonian_cuneiform_analysis.json for reference. The tester confirmed 100% completion with no errors and verified that all PLAN objectives were met including symbol identification, system explanation, and decimal conversion. The definitive answer is that the cuneiform symbols 𒐜  𒐐𒐚 represent the decimal number 30006 when read as a single positional number, or alternatively 8 and 1206 as two separate numbers based on the spacing. No further development is required as the research and analysis phase is complete.',

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive analysis performed by the developer in the HISTORY: (1) The Mesopotamian/Babylonian cuneiform symbols 𒐜  𒐐𒐚 were successfully decoded using standard Babylonian numerical notation where 𒐜=8, 𒐐=20, and 𒐚=6, (2) The sexagesimal (base-60) positional notation system was properly applied to calculate the decimal equivalent, (3) Two valid interpretations were identified based on the spacing in the original symbols: as a single number using positional notation (8×60² + 20×60¹ + 6×60⁰ = 28800 + 1200 + 6 = 30006) or as two separate numbers (8 and 1206), (4) The most likely interpretation for a single Babylonian number is 30006. Final answer: 30006',
