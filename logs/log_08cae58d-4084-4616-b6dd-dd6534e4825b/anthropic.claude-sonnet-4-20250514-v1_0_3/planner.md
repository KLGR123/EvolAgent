### Tizin VOS Translation for “I like apples” Using Maktay and Zapple

**TASK**: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.

    "description": "Task completed successfully through direct linguistic analysis. Based on the Tizin grammar rules provided: (1) Sentence structure is Verb-Object-Subject, (2) 'Maktay' means 'is pleasing to' in present tense, (3) The thing being liked (apples) becomes the subject in nominative form 'Apple', (4) The person doing the liking (I) becomes the object in accusative form 'Mato'. Therefore, 'I like apples' translates to 'Maktay Mato Apple' in Tizin. Final answer: Maktay Mato Apple",

### When Was Regression Label Added to Oldest Closed numpy.polynomial Issue (MM/DD/YY)

**TASK**: According to github, when was Regression added to the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue that has the Regression label in MM/DD/YY?
