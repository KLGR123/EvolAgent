                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task analysis: Determine the first year Apple stock exceeded $50 per share using Google Finance data without stock split adjustments. This requires accessing historical price data and understanding the distinction between split-adjusted and non-split-adjusted pricing. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 concluded 1987 based on stock split timing analysis, reasoning that splits typically occur when prices reach $50-100+ range. However, this approach relies on inference rather than actual price data verification. Member 2 concluded 1983-1984 using complex split adjustment calculations, claiming a 224:1 cumulative split factor and working backwards from current prices. This methodology contains fundamental errors - the member confused the direction of split adjustments and made unsupported assumptions about cumulative split ratios. Member 3 conducted direct web scraping of Yahoo Finance historical data, extracting 11,105 records from 1980-2024, and identified August 1, 2018 (closing at $50.38) as the first instance of Apple stock exceeding $50 in non-split-adjusted terms. Cross-analysis reveals significant divergence: Members 1 and 2 used indirect analytical approaches while Member 3 employed direct data verification. The fundamental issue is understanding 'without adjusting for stock splits' - this means using current, non-split-adjusted prices as they appear today on financial platforms, not historical original prices. Contradiction resolution: Member 3's approach aligns with how financial data is typically presented and requested, while Members 1 and 2 misinterpreted the task requirements. Integration assessment: Member 3's methodology provides the most reliable and verifiable results through direct data extraction and clear identification of the milestone date. Final validation confirms 2018 as the definitive answer based on actual historical price records.
