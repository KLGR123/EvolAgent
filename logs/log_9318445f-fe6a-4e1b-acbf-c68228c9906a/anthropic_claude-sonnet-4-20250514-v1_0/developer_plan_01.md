# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png to extract all fractions that use '/' as the fraction line and identify any sample problems with their answers. Parse the image content systematically to locate fractions in the order they appear, then solve any mathematical problems shown to obtain their answers for inclusion in the comma-separated list.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to examine the image content to identify fractions using '/' notation and any sample problems, (2) No previous analysis of this image file has been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to extract all relevant fractions and mathematical answers in their order of appearance, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement to provide a comma-separated list of fractions and sample problem answers ordered by appearance

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Analyze Python code file to understand logic, trace execution, and find its final numeric output.

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Python code file data/gaia/2023/validation/f918266a-b3e0-4914-865d-4faa564f1aef.py to understand its structure and logic. Read the complete code content, identify the main execution flow, trace through any calculations or operations, and determine what the final numeric output will be when this code is executed.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated security auditing of financial services Python scripts to detect unexpected exception paths and harmful random value usages before deployment
- Integration into a CI/CD pipeline for e-commerce microservices to trace code flow changes and prevent regressions in discount calculation logic
- Pre-release validation of healthcare analytics tools, ensuring that data sampling routines (randomized values) meet compliance criteria and don’t silently fail
- Educational platform feature that step-by-step parses student-submitted Python assignments, highlighting execution flow and exception handling for teaching programming concepts
- Quality assurance automation in IoT firmware code, analyzing logic paths that generate sensor threshold alerts to catch misconfigurations early
- Documentation generator for enterprise DevOps teams that reads source files, maps function and class structures, and produces human-readable execution overviews
- Research lab tool to validate stochastic simulation scripts by tracing random number generation criteria and logging first valid outcomes for reproducibility
- Government software compliance verifier that parses public sector codebases, traces exception-raising conditions, and produces audit-ready reports of code logic paths
