Parse the image content systematically to locate fractions in the order they appear and compile them into a comma-separated list without whitespace as requested.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to examine the provided image to identify all fractions using / as the fraction line and any sample problem answers, (2) No previous analysis of this image file has been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to extract all relevant fractions and answers in their order of appearance, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK requirements for creating the ordered comma-separated list',

    "description": "Task completed successfully. The GPT-4o analysis has fully satisfied all **PLAN** requirements: (1) Systematically analyzed the image file data/gaia/2023/validation/9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png, (2) Successfully extracted all 15 fractions using forward slash notation in the exact order they appear in the image, (3) Identified sample problems and their format, (4) Generated the required comma-separated list without whitespace: '3/4,1/4,1/2,5/35,7/21,30/5,2/4,1/2,6/8,4/60,30/90,8/18,9/72,64/46,206/340'. The tester confirmed 100% **PLAN** alignment with no errors and stated that no further development is needed. Output files created: workspace/fraction_analysis.txt (complete analysis) and workspace/final_fraction_list.txt (final result). The task is verified complete and successful.",

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. The developer has thoroughly analyzed the image file data/gaia/2023/validation/9318445f-fe6a-4e1b-acbf-c68228c9906a.png and extracted all fractions that use the forward slash (/) as the fraction line in their order of appearance. The comprehensive analysis identified 15 fractions total and generated the required comma-separated list without whitespace. Final answer: 3/4,1/4,1/2,5/35,7/21,30/5,2/4,1/2,6/8,4/60,30/90,8/18,9/72,64/46,206/340',
