### Who Was the 1879 Non-Voting Congressional Delegate from Territory with First Public High School?

**TASK**: Who was elected as a non-voting delegate to the U.S. Congress in 1879 from a territory that established its first public high school in 1879, the building of which later housed the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office?
