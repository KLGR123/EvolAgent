### Who Was the 1879 Non-Voting Congressional Delegate from Territory with First Public High School?

**TASK**: Who was elected as a non-voting delegate to the U.S. Congress in 1879 from a territory that established its first public high school in 1879, the building of which later housed the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office?

Focus on territorial histories, educational milestones, and congressional delegation records from 1879. Look for connections between early territorial high schools and later medical facilities, specifically any buildings that housed the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office.",

### When Did Indiana Legislature Name Knox County’s 23.6-Mile I-65 Segment for Governor Jennings?

**TASK**: When did the legislative body of Indiana pass a resolution to name a 23.6-mile section of Interstate 65, located in a county in Indiana established by the Virginia colonial legislature in 1783, in honor of Indiana's first governor?
