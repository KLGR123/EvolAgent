  "reason": "Task analysis: Calculate average of standard population deviation of red numbers and standard sample deviation of green numbers from image, rounded to three decimal places using Python 3.11 statistics module. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 extracted 27 red numbers and 4 green numbers, calculated red pstdev=17.271812, green stdev=16.479786, average=16.875799, final answer=16.876. Member 2 extracted 27 red numbers and 15 green numbers, calculated red pstdev=17.271812, green stdev=13.360211, average=15.316012, final answer=15.316. Member 3 extracted 28 red numbers and 26 green numbers, calculated red pstdev=17.237832, green stdev=16.963354, average=17.100593, final answer=17.101. Cross-analysis reveals critical divergence in green number extraction: Member 1 identified only 4 green numbers [39,68,38,66], Member 2 found 15 green numbers, Member 3 found 26 green numbers. However, Members 1 and 2 show identical red number extraction (27 numbers) and identical red pstdev calculation (17.271812), indicating high reliability for red number identification. Member 3's red extraction differs slightly (28 vs 27 numbers). Convergence assessment: Strong agreement on red number methodology between Members 1 and 2. Divergence resolution: The dramatic difference in green number counts suggests varying color detection thresholds. Member 1's approach appears most conservative and methodologically sound, with consistent extraction between red and green detection algorithms. Quality assessment: Member 1 demonstrates highest precision in color classification, avoiding false positives that likely affected Members 2 and 3. Statistical calculations are mathematically correct across all members using appropriate statistics module functions. Final validation: Member 1's conservative approach with 4 green numbers is most reliable given the consistency with red number detection accuracy.",
