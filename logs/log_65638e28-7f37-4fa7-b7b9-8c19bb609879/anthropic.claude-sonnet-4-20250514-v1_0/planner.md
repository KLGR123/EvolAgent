The analysis successfully accessed the archived A Song of Ice and Fire Wikipedia page from July 7, 2023 (closest available to the target date of July 3, 2023), extracted 379 inbound links, and cross-referenced them with 878 LOTR outbound links from the previously processed data.

Tolkien', 'High fantasy', 'Harry Potter', 'The Lord of the Rings (film series)', 'Good and evil', and 'Orc'. The code properly handled different data structures (LOTR using 'href' vs ASOIAF using 'url'), normalized article titles for accurate comparison, and provided comprehensive connection analysis. Since direct connections were found, there was no need to explore multi-step paths through intermediate pages as originally planned. All results are saved to workspace/lotr_asoiaf_connection_analysis.json with detailed mapping of connections from both sides. The PLAN objective of identifying direct connections between the Wikipedia pages of these two major fantasy series has been fully achieved.",
