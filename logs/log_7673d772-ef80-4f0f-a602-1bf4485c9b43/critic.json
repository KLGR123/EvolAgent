  "reason": "Task analysis: The complex multi-step research task required (1) identifying the fifth federal rules section alphabetically on Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute, (2) finding which article within that section has 'witnesses' in the most rule titles as of 2021, (3) examining the first rule in that article, and (4) determining what word was deleted in its most recent amendment. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted comprehensive systematic analysis, correctly identifying Federal Rules of Evidence as the fifth section, systematically counting 'witnesses' occurrences across all articles, finding Article 7 (Opinions and Expert Testimony) had the most with 3 occurrences, identifying Rule 701 as the first rule, and through detailed amendment history analysis determining 'inference' was deleted in the 2011 amendment with explicit Committee Notes documentation. Member 2 followed similar methodology but showed some confusion in interpretation, initially focusing on individual rules rather than articles, and concluded with 'shall' based on general restyling patterns rather than specific textual evidence. Member 3 executed parallel comprehensive analysis, correctly identifying the same progression through Federal Rules of Evidence → Article VII → Rule 701, and definitively found 'inference' as the deleted word with supporting Committee documentation. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 3 on methodology and final answer 'inference', while Member 2 diverged in final conclusion despite following similar initial steps. Evidence evaluation shows Members 1 and 3 provided specific Committee Notes stating 'The Committee deleted all reference to an inference' with clear rationale, while Member 2's conclusion lacked direct textual support. Final validation confirms 'inference' as the definitively correct answer based on explicit documentary evidence from Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute.",
