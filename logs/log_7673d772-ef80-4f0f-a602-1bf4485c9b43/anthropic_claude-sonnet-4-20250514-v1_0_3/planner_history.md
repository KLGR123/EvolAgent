    "plan": "Access Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website and identify all sections of federal rules available. Create a comprehensive list of these federal rule sections and arrange them alphabetically to determine which section is the fifth one. Extract the complete section names, URLs, and any relevant organizational structure to establish the correct alphabetical ordering.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to establish the foundation by identifying all federal rule sections on Cornell's LII website before determining the alphabetical fifth section, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain a complete alphabetical list of federal rule sections and identify the fifth one, (4) This provides the necessary groundwork for the subsequent steps of finding articles with 'witnesses' in titles and analyzing rule amendments.",

    "description": "The PLAN has been successfully completed. The previous execution successfully accessed Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website at https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules and comprehensively identified all federal rule sections available. The analysis found 6 total federal rule sections: (1) Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, (2) Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, (3) Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, (4) Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, (5) Federal Rules of Evidence, and (6) U.S. Supreme Court Rules. When arranged alphabetically, the 5th section is 'Federal Rules of Evidence' with URL https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre. The code extracted complete section names, URLs, and organizational structure as required, saving all data to workspace files (cornell_law_raw_data.json and cornell_law_federal_rules_analysis.json). The tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with successful execution and no errors. The objective to identify the fifth alphabetical federal rule section has been fully achieved.",

Count the occurrences of 'witnesses' in titles across all FRE articles and determine which article has the highest count.",
    "description": "This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have identified that the fifth alphabetical federal rule section is 'Federal Rules of Evidence' from the previous research, (2) We now need to analyze all articles within the FRE to find which one contains 'witnesses' in the most titles, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific article with the highest count of 'witnesses' in rule titles as of 2021, (4) This will establish which article we need to examine for the first rule and its last amendment to find the deleted word.",

    "description": "Based on the HISTORY feedback from the tester, the Federal Rules of Evidence analysis has been successfully completed. The code successfully accessed Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website, systematically analyzed all 69 individual FRE rule pages, and extracted complete rule titles to count 'witnesses' occurrences by article. From the execution output, I can definitively determine the final answer:\n\nüèÜ FINAL ANSWER - PLAN OBJECTIVE COMPLETED:\n\nThe Federal Rules of Evidence article containing 'witnesses' in the MOST rule titles is:\n\nARTICLE VII - OPINIONS AND EXPERT TESTIMONY\nCOUNT: 3 rule titles containing 'witnesses'\n\nSpecific rules with 'witnesses' in their titles:\n1. Rule 701: Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses\n2. Rule 702: Testimony by Expert Witnesses  \n3. Rule 706: Court-Appointed Expert Witnesses\n\nComparison with other articles:\n- Article VI (Witnesses): 2 rules containing 'witnesses' (Rules 611, 615)\n- Article VII (Opinions and Expert Testimony): 3 rules containing 'witnesses' (Rules 701, 702, 706)\n- All other articles: 0 rules containing 'witnesses'\n\nThe analysis was conducted as of 2021 using Cornell Law School's current FRE content. The methodology involved accessing individual rule pages to extract complete titles (not just rule numbers) and performing case-insensitive searches for 'witnesses' across all FRE articles. The results were saved to workspace files including fre_witnesses_final_analysis.json for verification.\n\n‚úÖ PLAN OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED: Successfully identified that Article VII - Opinions and Expert Testimony contains 'witnesses' in the most rule titles (3 occurrences) among all Federal Rules of Evidence articles as of 2021.",

    "description": "This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have identified that Article VII - Opinions and Expert Testimony contains 'witnesses' in the most rule titles (3 occurrences) as of 2021, making it the target article, (2) The first rule in Article VII is Rule 701: Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses, which we need to examine for its amendment history, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the last amendment to Rule 701 and identify the specific word that was deleted, (4) This will provide the final answer to the TASK by examining the amendment history and text changes of the first rule in the article with the most 'witnesses' titles.",
