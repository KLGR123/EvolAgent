# Developer Plan 03

## Plan
Access Rule 701 (Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses) on Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website and examine its complete amendment history to identify the most recent amendment. Extract the specific text changes made in the last amendment to determine what word was deleted from the rule. Focus on comparing the before and after versions of the rule text to identify the exact word that was removed.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified that Article 7 (Opinions and Expert Testimony) has the most 'witnesses' occurrences in rule titles (3 total) and Rule 701 is the first rule in this article, (2) The previous analysis found Rule 701 has amendment history spanning 1975-2011 with major revisions, but we need to examine the specific text changes in the most recent amendment, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the exact word that was deleted in the last amendment to Rule 701, (4) This will complete the TASK by providing the specific word that was removed from the first rule in the article with the most 'witnesses' titles

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 16: Identify 2002 regime-change measure repealed in 2023, co-sponsored by Cox, and Sessions’ 2005 speech venue.

**Description**: Research the 2002 legislation that was repealed by the U.S. Senate in 2023, had unresolved House legislative status, was co-sponsored by Christopher Cox, aimed to support regime change through opposition groups, and targeted a certain leader. Identify this specific measure that Jeff Sessions spoke in favor of, then determine where he delivered a speech about this legislation in 2005.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated regulatory compliance tracking for a law firm: nightly scraping of congressional websites to identify new authorizations or repeals (like H.J.Res. 114) and update client policy dashboards.
- Investigative journalism timeline builder: real-time extraction of bill metadata and speech venues to map out when and where key lawmakers (e.g., Jeff Sessions) advocated for regime-change resolutions.
- Political science research data aggregator: batch download and clean legislative texts and co-sponsorship records (Christopher Cox et al.) for statistical analysis of voting patterns over time.
- Nonprofit advocacy communications: automated monitoring of AUMF repeal efforts and opponent group support clauses to craft targeted email alerts and policy briefs.
- Government archival automation: scheduled scraping and JSON-based storage of congressional resolutions, vote outcomes, and speech transcripts for public records portals.
- Legal tech knowledge-graph builder: parse cleaned legislative and speech-venue data to populate an AI-driven Q&A system for attorneys researching foreign-policy authorizations.
- University course content generator: assemble case-study materials (legislation history, sponsor networks, speech contexts) for political science or international relations syllabi.

### Development Step 5: Testimony in 1933 Dillinger Jailbreak and Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern Gang Convictions

**Description**: Search specifically for information about the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger that resulted in the death of a sheriff and led to Harry Pierpont's conviction. Focus on identifying who provided testimony in this case and cross-reference with any testimony that also helped convict other gang leaders from the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang. Search for keywords including '1933 jailbreak John Dillinger fake credentials', 'Harry Pierpont sheriff death conviction', 'Lima Ohio jail break 1933', 'Dillinger escape plan testimony', and 'witness testimony Pierpont conviction'.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal research teams automating archival retrieval of witness testimony and court records to support precedent analysis in organized crime defense cases
- True-crime podcast producers aggregating and fact-checking 1930s jailbreak narratives and witness statements via API calls for immersive episode scripting
- Academic historians cross-referencing digital newspaper archives and trial transcripts to reconstruct the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang’s network for a peer-reviewed journal article
- Law enforcement cold-case units integrating JSON-formatted witness metadata and snippet analysis to uncover new leads in unsolved sheriff homicide investigations
- Educational technology platforms generating interactive timelines of historical jailbreak events by extracting dates, locations, and key participants from court document repositories
- Digital humanities researchers employing automated keyword searches and snippet classification to map testimony patterns across multiple 1930s bank robbery trials
- Investigative journalists conducting rapid background checks on historical criminal figures by cross-referencing API-fetched search results with court verdict data
- Insurance risk assessment teams analyzing historical crime incident data and witness testimony to model liability exposure for high-risk property underwriting

### Development Step 9: Identify Legume Wikipedia 2022 Content Violations and ‘R’ Definition in Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Wikipedia editorial oversight: scanning the Legume article’s public edit logs to detect instances of biased language (NPOV breaches), unverifiable claims (V), and original research (NOR) in edits made throughout 2022 before December, and producing policy-compliance reports.
- Corporate technical documentation audit: analyzing the revision history of an internal engineering wiki to flag unverified design claims and undocumented research insertions, ensuring all technical content meets the company's reliability standards akin to Reliable Sources.
- Social media content policy enforcement: processing comment and post logs on an online community forum to automatically identify and categorize policy infractions—such as defamation, hate speech, or false statements—mapping them to core policy codes (e.g., V for Verifiability, NOR for No Original Research) for the moderation team.
- Academic research integrity checks: reviewing student thesis draft revisions on a university’s digital submission portal to uncover any uncited original research (NOR violations) and confirm all assertions are supported by reliable, peer-reviewed sources (RS).
- Newswire fact-checking automation: ingesting document change logs from a news agency’s content management system to isolate and report additions lacking credible references or containing editorial bias, tagging violations under corresponding core policies and alerting editors in real time.
- E-commerce product description validation: examining change logs in a marketplace platform where sellers update product information, detecting unverifiable claims (V) or overhyped, unsupported details, and enforcing a neutral, research-backed standard before listing goes live.
- Government policy document review: parsing the version history of municipal policy drafts on an open-data portal to identify any introduction of original analysis or shifts in neutral language (NPOV, NOR violations), and summarizing findings for legal compliance and public transparency teams.

### Development Step 18: Identify 2002 regime-change measure co-sponsored by Christopher Cox and where Sessions spoke in 2005

**Description**: Research the 2002 legislation that was repealed by the U.S. Senate in 2023, had unresolved House legislative status, was co-sponsored by Christopher Cox, aimed to support regime change through opposition groups, and targeted a certain leader. Identify this specific measure that Jeff Sessions spoke in favor of, then determine where he delivered a speech about this legislation in 2005.

**Use Cases**:
- Legislative tracking and repeal monitoring for policy research organizations: automate identification of outdated AUMFs, co-sponsor verification, and 2023 repeal details to keep policy databases current
- Political event analytics for media outlets: scrape and structure data on senators’ 2005 Iraq-war speeches (e.g., Heritage Foundation) to enrich news coverage with venue and context metadata
- Compliance intelligence for legal consultancies: compile legislative histories, sponsor roles, and repeal actions into JSON and summary reports for client advisories on military authorization risks
- Academic case study compilation for political science researchers: extract bill metadata, sponsorship networks, and speech contexts into structured datasets to support scholarly analysis of regime-change legislation
- Lobbying strategy briefs for government affairs teams: generate timelines of congressional resolutions, identify key co-sponsors like Christopher Cox, and map speech venues to inform advocacy planning
- Archival automation for university law libraries: scrape legislation texts, sponsor information, and related speech transcripts, then convert into standardized JSON and summary files for digital repositories
- Investigative journalism data pipeline for policy reporters: consolidate multi-source legislative data and speech location details to create interactive visualizations of the 2002 Iraq AUMF and its 2023 repeal
- E-learning content generation for civic education platforms: produce concise, structured case summaries of the 2002 Iraq resolution and Jeff Sessions’ 2005 speech for interactive online lessons
