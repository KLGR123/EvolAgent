# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Access the Federal Rules of Evidence section on Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website and analyze all individual rules to identify which rule has the most occurrences of the word 'witnesses' in its title as of 2021. Count the frequency of 'witnesses' in each rule title and determine which rule qualifies as having the most references to witnesses.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have identified that the Federal Rules of Evidence is the fifth federal rules section alphabetically from the previous research, (2) We now need to examine all rules within this section to find the one with the most 'witnesses' references in titles as of 2021, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific rule that contains the most instances of 'witnesses' in its title, (4) This will allow us to then examine the first rule in that article and analyze its last amendment to find what word was deleted

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 5: Testimony in 1933 Dillinger Jailbreak and Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern Gang Convictions

**Description**: Search specifically for information about the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger that resulted in the death of a sheriff and led to Harry Pierpont's conviction. Focus on identifying who provided testimony in this case and cross-reference with any testimony that also helped convict other gang leaders from the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang. Search for keywords including '1933 jailbreak John Dillinger fake credentials', 'Harry Pierpont sheriff death conviction', 'Lima Ohio jail break 1933', 'Dillinger escape plan testimony', and 'witness testimony Pierpont conviction'.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal research teams automating archival retrieval of witness testimony and court records to support precedent analysis in organized crime defense cases
- True-crime podcast producers aggregating and fact-checking 1930s jailbreak narratives and witness statements via API calls for immersive episode scripting
- Academic historians cross-referencing digital newspaper archives and trial transcripts to reconstruct the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang’s network for a peer-reviewed journal article
- Law enforcement cold-case units integrating JSON-formatted witness metadata and snippet analysis to uncover new leads in unsolved sheriff homicide investigations
- Educational technology platforms generating interactive timelines of historical jailbreak events by extracting dates, locations, and key participants from court document repositories
- Digital humanities researchers employing automated keyword searches and snippet classification to map testimony patterns across multiple 1930s bank robbery trials
- Investigative journalists conducting rapid background checks on historical criminal figures by cross-referencing API-fetched search results with court verdict data
- Insurance risk assessment teams analyzing historical crime incident data and witness testimony to model liability exposure for high-risk property underwriting

### Development Step 4: Identify Witnesses in 1933 Dillinger Fake-Credentials Jailbreak, Sheriff’s Death, and Pierpont-Bridgewater Convictions

**Description**: Search specifically for information about the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger that resulted in the death of a sheriff and led to Harry Pierpont's conviction. Focus on identifying who provided testimony in this case and cross-reference with any testimony that also helped convict other gang leaders from the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang. Search for keywords including '1933 jailbreak John Dillinger fake credentials', 'Harry Pierpont sheriff death conviction', 'Lima Ohio jail break 1933', 'Dillinger escape plan testimony', and 'witness testimony Pierpont conviction'.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal case preparation for defense attorneys researching witness testimony and trial records from the 1933 Dillinger jailbreak to identify procedural errors or new exculpatory evidence.
- Academic criminal history analysis for a university professor compiling and categorizing primary sources on Harry Pierpont’s conviction and related gang trials for a peer-reviewed journal article.
- True-crime journalism deep dive to automate aggregation of newspaper archives, court transcripts, and eyewitness accounts around the Lima, Ohio jailbreak and sheriff’s death for an investigative series.
- Museum exhibit content curation to source and verify authentic trial documents, testimonies, and photos for an interactive Prohibition-era crime display on John Dillinger and his associates.
- Genealogy and family-history research for descendants tracing ancestral connections to the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang through court records and witness lists from 1933.
- Digital archiving and preservation for a historical society automating the discovery and categorization of scanned legal filings, trial transcripts, and newspaper clippings relating to the sheriff’s shooting.
- Law-enforcement training module development to build detailed case studies on investigative techniques, fake credentials methods, and witness testimony cross-referencing used in the Pierpont trial for modern detective academies.

### Development Step 3: Identify 2022 Legume Wikipedia content violations and the meaning of “R” in core policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate compliance auditing for an internal knowledge base: automatically parse HTML edit histories to identify content removals before December 2022, map them against three core documentation policies, and report what “R” stands for in each policy.
- Academic media studies research on Wikipedia edit behavior: extract 2022 pre-December policy violations and analyze how often core policies (including the “R” for Reliability) are cited in public logs.
- Newsroom fact-checking workflow: monitor high-traffic Wikipedia pages’ edit history HTML to flag potential vandalism or copyright removals in 2022 and correlate them with the three core policies’ “R” references.
- Open-source project documentation QA: scan project wiki talk pages’ HTML to detect spam, deletion requests, or policy breaches before December 2022 and verify adherence to the trio of core guidelines, especially the “R” criterion.
- Legal discovery and e-discovery support: process archived HTML logs from Wikipedia to extract instances of content disputes in 2022, identify the violated policy types, and determine the meaning of “R” in each policy context.
- Government transparency dashboard: analyze municipal information pages’ edit histories to track policy enforcement actions taken before December 2022 and highlight the role of “R” (Reliability) in official content standards.
- Nonprofit misinformation monitoring: parse HTML of selected topic pages’ talk and history files to uncover 2022 content violations, categorize them under the three core policies, and detail how “R” shapes the reliable sourcing rule.
- Enterprise knowledge management automation: integrate a parser for wiki-style HTML logs to continuously detect policy violations (including “R”-related reliability issues) in user-generated content during 2022’s first eleven months.

### Development Step 8: Analyzing 2022 Legume Wikipedia Log Violations: Violation Type and “R” Policy Definition

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Regulatory compliance audits of pharmaceutical Wikipedia pages to verify source reliability and detect No Original Research violations before drug approval submissions
- Media watchdog automated monitoring of political biography edits to flag Neutral Point of View breaches and biased language patterns
- Legal discovery workflows extracting historical revert (RV) actions and Reliable Sources disputes in trademark-related Wikipedia articles for litigation support
- Academic research data pipelines aggregating policy violation incidents across STEM entries to analyze trends in misinformation and editorial bias
- NGO crisis response teams tracking Verifiability breaches and unverified health claims on disaster-related Wikipedia pages to ensure accurate public information
- Corporate brand management platforms monitoring unauthorized promotional edits in product and competitor Wikipedia articles to safeguard brand integrity
- Wikipedia training programs leveraging real-world violation case studies from the Legume page to educate new editors on NPOV, Verifiability, and No Original Research policies
