# Developer Plan 03

## Plan
Since there are five Federal Rules of Evidence tied for having the most 'witnesses' references in their titles (Rules 611, 615, 701, 702, and 706), we need to clarify which specific rule constitutes 'the article' mentioned in the TASK. Access Rule 611 (Mode and Order of Examining Witnesses and Presenting Evidence) as the first alphabetically among the tied rules, then examine its amendment history to identify the most recent amendment and determine what word was deleted in that last amendment to this first rule.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The previous analysis identified five rules tied for most 'witnesses' references, but the TASK refers to 'the article' (singular) and 'the first rule in the article', suggesting we need to examine the specific rule content, (2) Rule 611 is the logical choice as it's alphabetically first among the tied rules and deals with examining witnesses, (3) Expected outcome is to access Rule 611's full text and amendment history to identify what word was deleted in its last amendment, (4) This directly addresses the final component of the TASK by examining the amendment history of the identified rule to find the deleted word

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 4: Identify Witnesses in 1933 Dillinger Fake-Credentials Jailbreak, Sheriff‚Äôs Death, and Pierpont-Bridgewater Convictions

**Description**: Search specifically for information about the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger that resulted in the death of a sheriff and led to Harry Pierpont's conviction. Focus on identifying who provided testimony in this case and cross-reference with any testimony that also helped convict other gang leaders from the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang. Search for keywords including '1933 jailbreak John Dillinger fake credentials', 'Harry Pierpont sheriff death conviction', 'Lima Ohio jail break 1933', 'Dillinger escape plan testimony', and 'witness testimony Pierpont conviction'.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal case preparation for defense attorneys researching witness testimony and trial records from the 1933 Dillinger jailbreak to identify procedural errors or new exculpatory evidence.
- Academic criminal history analysis for a university professor compiling and categorizing primary sources on Harry Pierpont‚Äôs conviction and related gang trials for a peer-reviewed journal article.
- True-crime journalism deep dive to automate aggregation of newspaper archives, court transcripts, and eyewitness accounts around the Lima, Ohio jailbreak and sheriff‚Äôs death for an investigative series.
- Museum exhibit content curation to source and verify authentic trial documents, testimonies, and photos for an interactive Prohibition-era crime display on John Dillinger and his associates.
- Genealogy and family-history research for descendants tracing ancestral connections to the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang through court records and witness lists from 1933.
- Digital archiving and preservation for a historical society automating the discovery and categorization of scanned legal filings, trial transcripts, and newspaper clippings relating to the sheriff‚Äôs shooting.
- Law-enforcement training module development to build detailed case studies on investigative techniques, fake credentials methods, and witness testimony cross-referencing used in the Pierpont trial for modern detective academies.

### Development Step 26: Arthur Morris‚Äôs Pre-1973‚Äì74 300+ Test Innings and the Australian Captain

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Fact-checking investigative journalism claims by analyzing archived online news articles to verify if a public figure delivered speeches exceeding three hours, identifying the event date and moderator.
- Pharmaceutical outcome validation by mining clinical trial repositories to confirm whether any Phase III studies reported drug efficacy above 90% in sample sizes over 1,000 before 2010, and identifying the lead clinical research scientist.
- Corporate financial compliance audit by scanning a company‚Äôs SEC filings (10-K/8-K) for mentions of restated net income exceeding $50 million, extracting the fiscal year and CFO responsible at the time.
- Legal e-discovery and contract review by processing a repository of corporate agreements to locate termination clauses requiring notice periods longer than six months, isolating clause text and listing contract managers for each contract.
- Academic systematic review for meta-analysis by aggregating published journal abstracts to find studies reporting statistically significant results (p < 0.001) in cohorts over 1,000 subjects published before 2015, summarizing primary authors and journal names.
- Consumer electronics quality assurance by analyzing internal test reports to identify device models that failed more than five consecutive drop tests, cataloging failure reasons and the responsible test engineer.
- Environmental sustainability benchmarking by scanning corporate CSR reports to extract instances where organizations pledged carbon emission reductions above 30% by 2025, and identifying the sustainability officer for follow-up.
- Cultural heritage archiving by searching museum and gallery exhibition records to confirm if an artist‚Äôs solo retrospectives attracted over 10,000 visitors before the year 2000, noting exhibition dates and curators.

### Development Step 28: Arthur Morris‚Äôs 300+ Test Innings: Identify Australian Captain Before 1973-74 Season

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal case document indexing and automated precedent analysis for litigation support teams
- Medical literature screening and evidence extraction for pharmaceutical clinical trial planning
- Digital archive authenticity verification and metadata enrichment for museum curation projects
- E-commerce competitor price monitoring and dynamic catalog adjustment for online retailers
- Regulatory compliance data aggregation and exception reporting for banking audit departments
- Academic systematic review workflow automation and statistical meta-analysis for research institutes
- News media fact-checking and multi-source cross-validation for journalism integrity units
- DevOps security pipeline integration for vulnerability scanning and consolidated reporting in software development
