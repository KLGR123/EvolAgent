    "description": 'This implementation analyzes the ice cream product image using GPT-4o multimodal capabilities to extract comprehensive product information. The approach focuses on identifying all visible text and nutritional information on the packaging, with particular attention to fat content specifications as requested in the PLAN. The code uses a detailed prompt to guide GPT-4o to look for specific elements like product name, brand, nutrition labels, butterfat content, ingredients, and serving sizes. Additionally, it attempts OCR extraction as a backup method to capture any text that might be missed by the visual analysis. All results are saved to workspace files for further reference and analysis. This systematic approach ensures thorough extraction of all relevant product information from the image.',

The script analyzed the ice cream product image and extracted comprehensive information including detailed nutrition facts (serving size 2/3 cup, 390 calories per serving, 21g total fat, 11g saturated fat), complete ingredient list (cream, skim milk, liquid sugar, etc.), and allergen information (contains soy, egg, wheat). While the specific product name and brand weren't visible in the image, GPT-4o successfully extracted all available nutrition labels, fat content specifications, and ingredient details as requested. The analysis was saved to workspace files for future reference, and OCR extraction was also attempted for additional text capture. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all visible product information has been identified and extracted.
