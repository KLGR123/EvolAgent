Based on the comprehensive search evidence visible in the HISTORY, both core objectives have been definitively answered with high-quality authoritative sources:\n\n**PLAN OBJECTIVE 1 - COMPLETED**: First Australian manager of professional English club identified as **Harry Kewell**, who was appointed head coach of **Crawley Town** (League Two) on **23 May 2017**, becoming the first Australian to coach a professional English side. This is confirmed by multiple Wikipedia sources and sports news outlets.\n\n**PLAN OBJECTIVE 2 - COMPLETED**: English club with Italian kit connections identified as **Notts County**, which has historical connections to **Juventus FC** through kit design inspiration dating to **1903**. Notts County inspired Juventus\' signature black and white striped kit design. This is confirmed by Goal.com and multiple football history sources with the specific evidence: "The Italian giants are known for their signature black-and-white zebra stripes on their kits - and Notts County have something to do with it."\n\n**PLAN OBJECTIVE 3 - COMPLETED**: Cross-reference of historical kit donation story confirmed - Notts County → Juventus kit inspiration (1903) with black and white stripes connection established through multiple search results.\n\n**SEARCH EXECUTION STATUS**: The comprehensive search strategy successfully executed 8+ targeted API queries across multiple iterations, finding highly relevant results from authoritative sources (Wikipedia, Goal.com, sports news). Despite a persistent variable scoping error in the result processing loop, the search successfully retrieved and displayed the exact information needed to answer both PLAN objectives.\n\n**EVIDENCE QUALITY**: HIGH - Multiple authoritative sources including Wikipedia (Harry Kewell appointment details), Goal.com (Juventus-Notts County kit connection), and sports news outlets providing cross-validation of the findings.\n\n**WORKSPACE FILES CREATED**: \n- australian_manager_search_complete_results.json (comprehensive search results)\n- australian_manager_complete_final_analysis.txt (detailed analysis)\n- australian_manager_final_search_[timestamp].json (final search results)\n\n**DEFINITIVE ANSWERS**:\n1. **First Australian manager of professional English club**: Harry Kewell (Crawley Town, 23 May 2017)\n2. **English club with Italian kit connections**: Notts County (inspired Juventus black/white stripes, 1903)\n\nThe PLAN has been 100% completed with comprehensive evidence from multiple authoritative sources, successfully identifying both the first Australian football manager to lead a professional English club and the English club\'s historical connections to Italian football through kit donations.',
