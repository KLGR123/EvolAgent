                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                1966<br><br>
                <strong>True Answer:</strong><br>
                1924<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task decomposition: This complex multi-part question requires identifying (1) a Northern Irish football club sharing stadium with Ards FC, (2) with an Anglo-Italian League trophy from 1978 at Storiel Museum, (3) whose manager won a Northern Irish competition with final at Solitude attended by 2,000, and (4) that manager's birth year. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted systematic research identifying Bangor FC as sharing Clandeboye Park with Ards FC, confirmed the Anglo-Italian League trophy connection to Storiel Museum, and through methodical database searches identified John Flanagan as the manager who won the County Antrim Shield in 1988/89 with final at Solitude, establishing his birth year as 1966 through official football records from worldfootball.net. Member 2 also correctly identified Bangor FC and the stadium arrangement, confirmed the Anglo-Italian League connection, but identified Roy Coyle (born 1946) as the relevant manager, though with less specific documentation of the exact competition and timing. Member 3 correctly established the Bangor FC connection and museum trophy details but identified Charlie Tully (born 1924) who won the County Antrim Shield in 1970, though this predates the Anglo-Italian League connection by several years. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on Bangor FC identification and Anglo-Italian League trophy verification, but divergence on manager identity and timeline. Critical evaluation shows Member 1 provided the most comprehensive and methodologically rigorous approach with specific database verification, precise timeline matching (1988/89 aligns with post-1978 Anglo-Italian League participation), and official source documentation. Member 1's identification of John Flanagan with birth year 1966 represents the most accurate synthesis of all required criteria with proper temporal sequencing and authoritative source verification.
