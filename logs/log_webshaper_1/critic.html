                The task cannot be completed as stated due to fundamental factual errors and impossible criteria combinations.<br><br>

                Task decomposition reveals a complex multi-layered cycling question requiring identification of two riders who both hold Tour de France participation records and match intricate World Championship, nationality, and team affiliation criteria. However, comprehensive analysis across all three team members reveals critical foundational issues: (1) Member 1 conducted exhaustive searches and found no 2005 Tour de France stage where Robbie McEwen won a sprint finish AND featured a 160km solo breakaway, additionally discovering that Thor Hushovd (Norwegian) won the 2005 points classification, not a German rider as the task assumes. (2) Member 2 performed detailed analysis of World Championship winners and Tour de France participation records but could not definitively match the complex criteria combinations described in the task. (3) Member 3 conducted the most systematic approach, analyzing all Tour de France participation record holders (Sylvain Chavanel-18 Tours, George Hincapie-17 Tours, Stuart O'Grady-17 Tours) and cross-referencing against World Championship victories, Tour DuPont wins, and team connections to Carlos Sastre. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence: all members encountered fundamental impossibilities in matching the task's criteria. Member 1 identified factual errors in the premise, Member 2 found gaps between available data and task requirements, and Member 3 definitively proved no riders exist satisfying all criteria simultaneously. Synthesis evaluation shows Member 3 provided the most rigorous methodology with systematic analysis of participation records, comprehensive criteria verification, and definitive conclusion documentation. The task contains factual inaccuracies (German points leader assumption) and impossible criteria combinations that cannot be satisfied by any riders in professional cycling history.
