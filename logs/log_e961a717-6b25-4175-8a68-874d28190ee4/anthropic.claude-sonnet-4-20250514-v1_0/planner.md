### Fewest Wikipedia clicks from Lord of the Rings to A Song of Ice and Fire

**TASK**: What is the minimum number of page links a person must click on to go from the english Wikipedia page on The Lord of the Rings (the book) to the english Wikipedia page on A Song of Ice and Fire (the book series)? In your count, include each link you would click on to get to the page. Use the pages as they appeared at the end of the day on July 3, 2023.

The code properly handled different data structures (LOTR using 'href' vs ASOIAF using 'url'), normalized article titles for accurate comparison, and provided comprehensive connection analysis. Since direct connections were found, there was no need to explore multi-step paths through intermediate pages as originally planned.
