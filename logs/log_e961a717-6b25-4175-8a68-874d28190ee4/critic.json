  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine the count of Asian countries that simultaneously maintained monarchical systems and had coastal access to seas/oceans in 2021, using Wikipedia as the authoritative source. All three members employed systematic research methodologies with high convergence on results. Member 1 evaluation: Used comprehensive two-phase approach - first identifying all Asian monarchies (13 countries), then analyzing coastal geography. Demonstrated excellent methodological rigor with detailed categorization of constitutional vs. absolute monarchies, proper geographic analysis, and systematic verification. Created comprehensive documentation with JSON and text outputs. Achieved correct identification of 12 coastal monarchies. Member 2 evaluation: Employed integrated research strategy combining monarchical system identification with simultaneous coastal verification. Showed strong Wikipedia research methodology and proper cross-referencing techniques. Reached identical results (12 countries) with accurate country identification and coastal status verification. Good documentation practices with structured data preservation. Member 3 evaluation: Applied sequential analysis approach similar to Member 1, with systematic identification of 13 Asian monarchies followed by coastal access determination. Demonstrated thorough research methodology with confidence-level assessments and evidence-based classifications. Achieved same final count (12 countries) with detailed geographic context and proper landlocked vs. coastal distinctions. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: All members identified identical 13 Asian monarchies (Bahrain, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, UAE) and correctly determined that only Bhutan lacks sea access due to landlocked geography. Synthesis validation: Multiple independent verification paths confirm 12 as the definitive answer, with consistent identification of coastal monarchies across all approaches. Final confidence level: Very high, supported by unanimous team consensus and methodological consistency.",
