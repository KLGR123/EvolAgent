# Developer Plan #1 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 99c9cc74-fdc8-46c6-8f8d-3ce2d3bfeea3  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 01:53:39

## Plan Content
```
Transcribe the audio file data/gaia/2023/validation/99c9cc74-fdc8-46c6-8f8d-3ce2d3bfeea3.mp3 into a complete text transcript of the voice memo containing the strawberry pie filling recipe.
```

## Plan Description
```
This plan is optimal because: (1) The TASK requires extracting ingredients from a voice memo that is currently unintelligible due to buzzing, (2) No previous transcription exists in HISTORY, (3) A full transcript is necessary to identify and list all filling ingredients accurately, (4) This step advances toward the final list of ingredients by providing the raw textual content for analysis.
