# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 99c9cc74-fdc8-46c6-8f8d-3ce2d3bfeea3  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 01:52:43

## Plan Content
```
Format the extracted strawberry pie filling ingredients into the final comma-separated, alphabetized list as requested in the TASK. The ingredients identified from Aditi's voice memo were: fresh strawberries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, cold water, and lemon juice. Present these ingredients in alphabetical order as a comma-separated list without measurements, following the exact formatting requirements specified by the user.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the final step because: (1) The audio file has been successfully analyzed and all filling ingredients have been extracted from the transcript, (2) The developer has identified 5 specific ingredients for the strawberry pie filling as mentioned by Aditi, (3) Expected outcome is to provide the properly formatted final answer meeting all TASK requirements (alphabetized, comma-separated, ingredients only without measurements), (4) This completes the TASK by delivering the shopping list in the exact format requested
