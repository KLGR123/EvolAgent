  "reason": "Task analysis: Calculate average additional cost per file for storage overage requiring plan upgrade, with precision to nearest cent in x.xx format. All three members successfully analyzed the image to extract plan details: Standard ($9.99/month, 2TB), Plus ($19.99/month, 10TB), Premium ($39.99/month, 50TB). Critical divergence identified in file size calculations: Member 1 calculated 1.67GB per file (100GB overage รท 60 files), while Members 2 and 3 calculated ~35GB per file (total usage 2.1TB รท 60 files). This fundamental difference led to different plan requirements and cost calculations. Member 1's approach contains logical error - the 100GB represents overage beyond the 2TB limit, not total storage used by 60 files. Members 2 and 3 correctly interpreted that 60 files used 2.1TB total storage (2TB + 100GB overage), yielding 35GB per file. Member 1 incorrectly concluded Plus plan sufficient (final answer $0.01), while Members 2 and 3 correctly determined Premium plan required for 1040 files at 35GB each (36.4TB total). Cross-analysis validation: Members 2 and 3 show strong convergence on methodology and results, both reaching $0.03 through sound reasoning. Member 3 provides most rigorous analysis with detailed verification steps and precise calculation of 983 files exceeding Standard limit. Final validation confirms: Premium plan ($39.99) - Standard plan ($9.99) = $30.00 additional monthly cost รท 983 exceeding files = $0.030519, rounded to $0.03.",
