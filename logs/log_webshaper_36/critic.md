Task decomposition: This complex question requires identifying (1) the first Australian football manager to lead a professional English club, (2) which English club sent replica kits to an Italian club that operated in 1903 with black/white stripes inspired by English football, and (3) the manager's win total at that specific club. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted the most comprehensive and accurate analysis, correctly identifying Harry Kewell as the first Australian manager and establishing that Notts County (not Crawley Town) is the English club with the required Italian connection. Member 1 found that Notts County sent black and white striped kits to Juventus in 1903 through John Savage's arrangement, and that Harry Kewell managed Notts County from August 31 to November 13, 2018, winning 3 games out of 14 total matches. Member 2 also identified the correct historical connection between Notts County and Juventus but provided the same final answer of 3 wins at Notts County. Member 3 focused on Crawley Town and found Harry Kewell won 18 games there, but failed to establish the required Italian connection, concluding incorrectly that the connection worked through 'historical inspiration' rather than actual kit exchange. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on Harry Kewell as the first Australian manager and the Notts County-Juventus 1903 kit connection, but divergence on which club's record to count. Resolution: The task specifically asks for wins 'during his tenure as manager of that club, which sent replica kits to an Italian football club.' Since Notts County is definitively the club that sent kits to Juventus in 1903, and Harry Kewell managed Notts County (winning 3 games), this is the correct answer. Members 1 and 2 demonstrated superior analytical rigor by identifying the precise club-to-club kit exchange rather than accepting indirect historical inspiration.
