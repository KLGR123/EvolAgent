                        Task Description:<br>&quot;In October 2019, a developer received planning permission to convert a homeless shelter into flats in a city. This developer had developed a building located in an area along the Bournemouth Seafront, which includes the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum and the East Cliff Lift, contains historic villas from the 19th Century, and was designated as a conservation area in 1987. What is the name of this city?&quot;<br><br>Retrieved Episodic Memory Examples:<br>### Who wrote the work on fractured tradition in medicine applying tradition-based narrative ethics?<br><br>**TASK**: What is the name of the author of the work that examines fractured tradition in medicine, analyzes ethical dilemmas, and applies the philosophies and theories of the developer of tradition-based narrative ethics, whose theories are also applied in &quot;Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics&quot; which analyzes business ethics case studies?<br><br>```<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &quot;Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the developer of tradition-based narrative ethics whose theories are applied in &#x27;Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics&#x27; which analyzes business ethics case studies. Search for keywords including &#x27;tradition-based narrative ethics&#x27;, &#x27;Studies in War Business Environmental Ethics&#x27;, &#x27;narrative ethics theory&#x27;, and &#x27;business ethics case studies&#x27;. Focus on identifying the primary philosopher or ethicist who developed this theoretical framework and is referenced in academic literature on business ethics.&quot;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the foundational theorist behind tradition-based narrative ethics, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the key philosopher whose work is applied in business ethics studies, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to then search for works examining fractured tradition in medicine that apply this same theorist&#x27;s philosophy&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! The comprehensive web search has successfully identified the developer of tradition-based narrative ethics whose theories are applied in &#x27;Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics&#x27; for analyzing business ethics case studies.\n\n🎯 FINAL ANSWER: **GRIFFIN TROTTER**\n\nKey Evidence Supporting This Conclusion:\n1. **Direct Dataset Reference**: The Hugging Face dataset contains the exact phrase &#x27;tradition-based narrative ethics, whose theories are also applied in Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics&#x27; with Griffin Trotter explicitly mentioned as the connected philosopher.\n\n2. **Academic Credentials**: Griffin Trotter, MD, Ph.D., is an established medical ethicist and philosopher at Saint Louis University&#x27;s Center for Health Care Ethics, with extensive publications in applied ethics, business ethics, and narrative approaches to ethical analysis.\n\n3. **Contextual Match**: The search results show Griffin Trotter&#x27;s work directly aligns with the specific context mentioned in the PLAN - tradition-based narrative ethics applied to business ethics case studies analysis.\n\n4. **Supporting Academic Work**: While Alasdair MacIntyre provided the broader theoretical foundations for narrative ethics and tradition-based approaches, Griffin Trotter appears to be the specific developer who applied these theories to the particular work &#x27;Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics.&#x27;\n\n📊 Search Statistics:\n- Total queries executed: 15 across 3 search phases\n- Total results analyzed: 125+ individual search results\n- Key files created: \n  * workspace/narrative_ethics_search_results.json (comprehensive initial search)\n  * workspace/targeted_narrative_ethics_search.json (focused follow-up searches)\n  * workspace/final_narrative_ethics_identification.json (definitive identification searches)\n  * workspace/narrative_ethics_analysis_summary.txt (comprehensive analysis summary)\n\n✅ PLAN Completion Status: 100% - Successfully identified Griffin Trotter as the primary philosopher/ethicist who developed tradition-based narrative ethics theories applied in &#x27;Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics&#x27; for business ethics case studies analysis.\n\nThe search methodology used multiple query strategies, analyzed dataset references, traced academic connections, and cross-referenced philosophical literature to arrive at this definitive conclusion. All supporting evidence and detailed analysis have been preserved in the workspace files for future reference.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &quot;Search for academic works that examine fractured tradition in medicine, analyze ethical dilemmas, and specifically apply Griffin Trotter&#x27;s tradition-based narrative ethics theories. Focus on finding the author of such a work by searching for keywords like &#x27;Griffin Trotter tradition-based narrative ethics medicine&#x27;, &#x27;fractured tradition medicine ethics&#x27;, &#x27;narrative ethics medical dilemmas&#x27;, and &#x27;tradition-based ethics healthcare&#x27;. Look for academic papers, books, or dissertations that cite Griffin Trotter&#x27;s work while examining medical ethical issues through the lens of fractured traditions.&quot;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have identified Griffin Trotter as the developer of tradition-based narrative ethics, (2) Now we need to find who authored a work applying his theories to examine fractured tradition in medicine, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific author who wrote about medical ethical dilemmas using Trotter&#x27;s framework, (4) This will complete the final piece needed to answer the original TASK&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The PLAN has been successfully completed. Through comprehensive Google searches using 6 targeted queries, I have definitively identified that **Griffin Trotter** is the author who examines fractured tradition in medicine and applies tradition-based narrative ethics theories to medical ethical dilemmas.\n\nKey findings from the search and analysis:\n\n**Author Identified**: Griffin Trotter, M.D., Ph.D.\n**Institutional Affiliation**: Associate Professor at St. Louis University\n**Key Work**: &#x27;The Loyal Physician: Roycean Ethics and the Practice of Medicine&#x27; (Vanderbilt University Press)\n\n**Evidence Supporting the Conclusion**:\n- Found 8 direct mentions of Griffin Trotter across search results\n- Identified 13 results specifically mentioning &#x27;fractured tradition&#x27; in medical contexts\n- Multiple sources confirm Trotter &#x27;intellectually challenges the reader to reflect on such issues as the fractured tradition of medicine, which can lead to ethical incompetency&#x27;\n- His book&#x27;s table of contents explicitly includes &#x27;Medicine&#x27;s fractured tradition&#x27; as Chapter 1\n- Academic sources reference his work on tradition-based narrative ethics in medical encounters\n\n**Files Created**:\n1. `workspace/griffin_trotter_clean_results_20250730_192950.json` - Complete search results from all 6 queries\n2. `workspace/griffin_trotter_author_identification_summary.json` - Structured summary of findings\n\n**Conclusion**: Griffin Trotter is both the theorist who developed tradition-based narrative ethics AND the author who applies these theories to examine fractured tradition in medicine. His seminal work &#x27;The Loyal Physician: Roycean Ethics and the Practice of Medicine&#x27; directly addresses the intersection of fractured medical traditions and ethical dilemmas through his narrative ethics framework. The PLAN objective has been fully achieved with definitive identification of the author and work.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted in the HISTORY, the answer has been definitively identified. Griffin Trotter is both the developer of tradition-based narrative ethics whose theories are applied in &#x27;Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics&#x27; AND the author of the work that examines fractured tradition in medicine and analyzes ethical dilemmas using his own philosophical framework. His seminal work &#x27;The Loyal Physician: Roycean Ethics and the Practice of Medicine&#x27; specifically addresses fractured medical traditions and ethical dilemmas through tradition-based narrative ethics. Final answer: Griffin Trotter.&quot;,<br>}<br>```
