## Plan Content
```
Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the city where a developer received planning permission in October 2019 to convert a homeless shelter into flats. Focus on searching for news articles, planning applications, and local government records from October 2019 using keywords like 'October 2019 planning permission homeless shelter flats conversion', 'homeless shelter converted flats October 2019', and 'planning permission shelter housing development 2019'. Cross-reference results with locations that have Bournemouth Seafront areas containing Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th century historic villas, and conservation areas designated in 1987.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific city and developer from October 2019 planning records, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find news coverage or official planning documents about this homeless shelter conversion, (4) This directly targets the core TASK of identifying the city with the specific geographic and historical features mentioned

Based on the tester feedback confirming 100% PLAN completion, I'm extracting and analyzing the key evidence that points to BOURNEMOUTH as the answer. The analysis focuses on: (1) Harry Redknapp as the developer who received planning permission on 15 October 2019, (2) Bournemouth as the location with 18 mentions across search results, (3) Verification that Bournemouth contains all required landmarks (Russell-Cotes Art Gallery, East Cliff Lift, Victorian villas, 1987 conservation areas, seafront), (4) Multiple corroborating sources including BBC News article with exact date confirmation. The code inspects the search results file structure first, then extracts critical evidence showing Harry Redknapp's company Pierfront Properties received approval to convert former hotel homeless accommodation into flats in Bournemouth. Final analysis confirms BOURNEMOUTH as the definitive answer with comprehensive supporting evidence saved to workspace for reference.",
