## Final Answer
```
Bournemouth
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the city where a developer received planning permission in October 2019 to convert a homeless shelter into flats, with specific geographic identifiers including Bournemouth Seafront, Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th century historic villas, and 1987 conservation area designation. All three members conducted comprehensive web searches using systematic methodologies. Member 0 employed constraint mapping with targeted search terms, identifying Harry Redknapp (Pierfront Properties) as the developer and Bournemouth as the location through cross-referencing BBC News, i News, The Guardian, and local planning records. Member 1 used focused query analysis across multiple search strategies, confirming the same developer and location with evidence from BBC (October 15, 2019), Wikipedia, New Statesman, and Guardian sources. Member 2 conducted broad web searches with 129 results across 10 query strategies, achieving identical conclusions with overwhelming evidence (18 mentions of Bournemouth vs other cities). Convergence analysis: Perfect agreement across all members on both developer (Harry Redknapp/Pierfront Properties) and city (Bournemouth), with consistent October 2019 timeline and homeless shelter conversion details. All members verified the location contains required landmarks: Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, East Cliff Lift, historic villas, and conservation areas. Cross-validation through multiple independent sources (BBC News headline: 'Harry Redknapp to turn Bournemouth homeless accommodation into flats' October 15, 2019) provides definitive confirmation. Integration assessment: All methodologies yielded identical results with comprehensive source verification, indicating extremely high reliability. Final validation: Bournemouth definitively contains all specified geographic and historical features, with documented October 2019 planning permission for shelter-to-flats conversion.
