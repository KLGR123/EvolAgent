    "description": 'The PLAN has been successfully completed with high confidence.

While specific location details about Russell-Cotes Art Gallery proximity, East Cliff Lift area, and 1987 conservation area status would require additional verification, the primary objective of identifying the developer who received planning permission in October 2019 to convert a homeless shelter into flats in Bournemouth has been achieved with certainty.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: Harry Redknapp (Pierfront Properties) is the developer referenced in the PLAN.',

    "plan": "Search specifically for the city name where Harry Redknapp's October 2019 homeless shelter conversion project took place, focusing on identifying whether this occurred in Bournemouth itself or another city that contains the Bournemouth Seafront area with Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, East Cliff Lift, historic 19th century villas, and 1987 conservation area designation. Cross-reference the Christchurch Road location mentioned in previous findings with official city boundaries and administrative divisions.",
    "description": "This plan is necessary because: (1) Previous search identified Harry Redknapp as the developer and Christchurch Road, Bournemouth as the location, but the TASK asks for the city name specifically, (2) We need to verify whether 'Bournemouth' is the complete city name or if it's part of a larger municipal area, (3) Expected outcome is to definitively identify the official city name where this development occurred, (4) This will provide the precise answer required by the TASK",
