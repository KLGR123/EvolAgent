### Profession of Founder of Mexico City Firm Operating Gran Hotel, CINETOP, and Telemundo Partnership

**TASK**: What is the profession of the person who founded a Mexico City-based company that owns Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico, operates CINETOP, and partnered in 2006 with a television expansion project launched by Telemundo—which sought a broadband license in Mexico that year, partnered with Grupo Medcom for news operations, and operates the news program Noticiero Telemundo Internacional?

The comprehensive research successfully gathered and analyzed information from multiple authoritative sources including PitchBook company profiles, official websites, business news archives (LA Times, NY Times, Variety, Orange County Register), LinkedIn profiles, and industry databases. \n\nFINDINGS SUMMARY:\n\n1. CINETOP-Grupo Hunan Connection: ❌ NO CONNECTION FOUND\n   - José Miguel Cuaik Mena confirmed as founder/chairman of Grupo Hunan (restaurant group founded 1993 in Mexico City)\n   - CINETOP confirmed as independent Mexican movie theater chain (50-99 employees, 1M-5M revenue)\n   - Extensive searches found no evidence of ownership or operational connection between Grupo Hunan and CINETOP\n   - Grupo Hunan operates 26 upscale-casual restaurants across 14 brands, focused entirely on restaurant business\n\n2. Telemundo 2006 Mexico Expansion Partner: ✅ PARTNER IDENTIFIED - GRUPO XTRA\n   - Multiple 2006 news sources definitively confirm Telemundo partnered with Grupo Xtra (owned by Mr. Saba)\n   - Partnership specifically aimed at Mexico TV market entry and seeking broadband/broadcasting licenses\n   - Grupo Xtra formally requested broadcasting license with Telemundo in September 2006\n   - This is separate from Grupo Medcom (Serna family), which had earlier Telemundo Internacional connections\n\n3. Cross-Reference Analysis: ❌ NO CROSS-CONNECTION\n   - No evidence that the same Mexico City-based company (Grupo Hunan) was involved in both CINETOP operations and Telemundo partnerships\n   - Telemundo's 2006 partner was Grupo Xtra, not Grupo Hunan\n   - The plan's hypothesis of a cross-connection is not supported by evidence\n\nMETHODOLOGY: 12 comprehensive search queries across multiple backends (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Yahoo), targeted searches for all key entities, cross-reference analysis, and consultation of authoritative business sources. Research data saved to workspace files including cinetop_telemundo_final_analysis.json and cinetop_telemundo_raw_search_data.txt.\n\nCONCLUSION: Both plan objectives thoroughly investigated with high-confidence definitive results. Grupo Hunan does not operate CINETOP, and Telemundo's 2006 Mexico expansion partner for broadband licenses was Grupo Xtra, not Grupo Hunan.",

Key findings: (1) Dom José Rodrigues was a Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Juazeiro, Brazil, (2) He was a Redemptorist missionary (C.Ss.R.) ordained in 1950, (3) He served as Bishop from 1974-2003, (4) He created CPT Juazeiro specifically for Sobradinho Dam displaced families, (5) Multiple authoritative Wikipedia sources confirm his Catholic bishop status with biographical details (born 1926, died 2012). The research examined four target individuals but only Dom José Rodrigues showed clear religious affiliation evidence. Other advocates (Maciel Oliveira - CBHSF President, Ednaldo Campos, Fabíola Silva) had no religious affiliation information found.
