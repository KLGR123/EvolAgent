  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine how many clients will receive sunset awning designs based on street address analysis from Excel file, requiring data extraction, address parsing, and odd/even classification logic. All three team members demonstrated identical analytical approaches and reached unanimous conclusions. Member 0 executed systematic Excel file parsing, extracted all 12 client records, implemented regex-based street number extraction, and correctly applied the regional rule that even-numbered addresses face west (requiring sunset blocking awnings). Member 1 followed parallel methodology with identical data extraction and classification logic, confirming 4 clients with even addresses and 8 with odd addresses. Member 2 replicated the same comprehensive approach with consistent results. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: all members identified 12 total clients, applied correct business logic (even addresses = west-facing = sunset designs), and reached identical count of 4 clients. No contradictions detected in methodology, data interpretation, or final results. Synthesis evaluation: All approaches demonstrated methodological soundness with proper Excel parsing, accurate regex implementation for address extraction, and correct application of the odd/even classification rule. Integration validation: Multiple independent analyses confirming identical results provides high confidence in accuracy. Final verification: 4 clients with even-numbered street addresses will receive sunset awning designs, representing clients whose west-facing houses require protection from western sunset exposure.",
