# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/4d51c4bf-4b0e-4f3d-897b-3f6687a7d9f2.xlsx to extract the complete client list for the retractable awning company. Identify the data structure including client information and street addresses, then determine which clients have odd-numbered street addresses (facing east, needing sunrise blocking awnings) versus even-numbered street addresses (facing west, needing sunset blocking awnings). Count the total number of clients who will receive the sunset awning design based on their even-numbered addresses.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the Excel file structure and extract all client data including street addresses before determining awning design requirements, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete client data with address analysis to identify which clients face west (even addresses) and need sunset-blocking awnings, (4) This directly addresses the core task of counting clients who will receive sunset awning designs based on the address-direction relationship provided

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Parse Excel File for Cell Coordinates, Text, Fill Colors, and ‘START’/‘END’ Locations

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx to extract the complete grid structure: record for each cell its row–column coordinate, displayed text, and fill color as a 6-digit hex code, then identify the coordinates of the cell containing 'START' and the cell containing 'END'.

**Use Cases**:
- Warehouse AGV route optimization and automated navigation using Excel grid layouts; extract cell coordinates, fill colors for storage zones, and identify START (loading bay) and END (docking station)
- Video game level map ingestion and design automation by parsing Excel-based tile grids, reading cell colors for terrain types, and locating START/END spawn points
- Construction site safety path planning with hazard zone extraction from color-coded Excel floor plans; determine safe route from START (entrance) to END (exit)
- Manufacturing line process monitoring by parsing Excel diagrams of assembly stations, capturing status color codes, and locating START and END of the production flow
- Clinical laboratory sample rack layout processing; read Excel grid to map sample positions by fill-color status and identify START (first sample) and END (last sample) wells for automated pipetting
- Research experiment plate map analysis for high-throughput screening; extract cell coordinates and reagent status colors, then pinpoint START and END wells for liquid handling robots
- Event seating arrangement and attendee flow mapping by parsing color-coded Excel seating charts; extract seat coordinates and colors for zones, identifying START (entry gate) and END (exit gate) points

### Development Step 1: Excel Grid Parsing: Record Cell Coordinates, Text, Fill Colors, Identify START and END Cells

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx to extract the complete grid structure: record for each cell its row–column coordinate, displayed text, and fill color as a 6-digit hex code, then identify the coordinates of the cell containing 'START' and the cell containing 'END'.

**Use Cases**:
- Project timeline extraction for construction management: parse a color-coded Gantt chart in Excel to import each task’s grid position, label, and scheduling colors, then automatically locate the “START” kickoff milestone and “END” completion point.
- Retail shelf planogram automation: extract the full store shelving grid with product names and color-coded stock levels from an Excel layout, identify the beginning (“START”) and end (“END”) of each aisle for dynamic planogram updates.
- AGV navigation map generation in manufacturing: read an Excel-based factory floor grid with zones highlighted by fill color, output precise coordinates for every cell, and locate the “START” docking station and “END” delivery bay for autonomous guided vehicles.
- Classroom seating performance analysis: parse a teacher’s Excel seating chart where student names and test scores are color-coded, record each desk’s coordinates and find designated “START” and “END” rows for group activities arrangement.
- Game level prototyping: convert a level design represented in Excel cells (with obstacles and power-ups color-coded) into JSON; pinpoint the “START” spawn cell and “END” exit cell for rapid engine import.
- Real estate floorplan digitization: extract room labels, dimensions, and color-coded zones (e.g., living, kitchen, bedrooms) from an Excel blueprint, capturing each cell’s coordinates and fill color, then identify the main “START” entrance and emergency “END” exits.
- High-throughput screening data mapping in biotech: interpret a microtiter plate layout from Excel, record each well’s row–column address, sample identifier, and color-coded assay result, and locate the “START” reference well and “END” control well for automated analysis.

### Development Step 2: Identify and Visualize Earl Smith’s Green Land Plot Cells in Excel Layout

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel spreadsheet file data/gaia/2023/validation/5cfb274c-0207-4aa7-9575-6ac0bd95d9b2.xlsx to identify all green cells representing Earl Smith's land plots. Extract the cell positions, colors, and create a visual representation of the spreadsheet layout to understand the spatial distribution of Earl's plots relative to other landowners' plots.

**Use Cases**:
- Real estate portfolio mapping and visual distribution analysis for commercial property management firms
- Municipal zoning extraction and GIS integration for urban planning departments
- Agricultural subsidy eligibility scanning and field plot mapping for government farm agencies
- Habitat conservation data parsing and protected area mapping for environmental NGOs
- Utility service area identification and maintenance scheduling for energy infrastructure operators
- Construction site allocation parsing and resource coordination for general contractor firms
- Insurance risk plot identification and premium calculation optimization for underwriting teams
- Community land tenure extraction and documentation mapping for international development NGOs

### Development Step 1: Parse File Road Layout, Locate Houses, Mile Markers, Define Coordinates, Compute House-Tower Distances

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached file data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt to understand the road layout, identify all house positions, and map their locations relative to mile markers. Extract the visual representation showing dashes (-) as mile markers and H symbols as houses, then determine the coordinate system and calculate distances between houses and potential tower locations.

**Use Cases**:
- Rural broadband deployment planning: parse the ASCII road layout to extract house locations by mile marker, then calculate optimal fiber cable routes to bring high-speed internet to each home.
- Emergency medical services optimization: analyze the distances between mapped house positions and candidate ambulance station sites to determine the fastest response coverage along a remote highway.
- Postal delivery route automation: ingest the text-based road map to pinpoint rural mailbox locations, then compute the shortest delivery loop for mail carriers using mile-marker coordinates.
- Electric grid maintenance scheduling: map household positions relative to power line inspection crews’ depots to sequence pipeline or line checks by proximity and minimize downtime.
- Mobile network coverage analysis: identify service gaps by measuring distances from village houses to existing cell towers and recommend new tower installations to fill black spots.
- Environmental sensor network design: use the extracted house coordinates along farmland roads to position weather or soil-moisture sensors at optimal intervals for agricultural research.
- Real estate site evaluation: chart the distribution of roadside properties via mile markers to spotlight high-density clusters for targeted development and marketing campaigns.
