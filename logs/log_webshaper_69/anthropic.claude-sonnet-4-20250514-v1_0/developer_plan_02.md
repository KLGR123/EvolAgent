# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_69  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-12 07:29:59

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about The Frogs band members, specifically focusing on identifying which member filled in as keyboardist for The_Family_(band), Prince's side project. Look for biographical information about The Frogs members (particularly Jimmy Flemion and Dennis Flemion), their musical collaborations, connections to Prince-related projects, and any instances where they served as substitute musicians for other bands. Cross-reference with information about The_Family_(band) to identify which keyboardist needed a replacement and when this occurred.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) Previous research successfully identified The Frogs as the band that recorded the four specified songs in the three-day $1500 session, (2) We now need to determine which Frogs member had the connection to The_Family_(band) as a fill-in keyboardist, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific band member who performed this role and establish their identity, (4) This will enable us to then search for their birth date to complete the TASK

### Development Step 23: Identify French-Origin Pioneer Pictures Composers for 1976 Montreal Olympics Theme Music

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements and search for alternative composers who both worked for Pioneer Pictures and composed theme music for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. The previous research focused on André Mathieu who was born in Canada, not France, which doesn't match the TASK criteria. Search for other composers associated with the 1976 Montreal Olympics who might have French origins and Pioneer Pictures connections, including any secondary composers, arrangers, or musicians involved in the Olympic ceremonies who had film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Journalistic fact-checking of claims linking a French-born composer to both Pioneer Pictures and the 1976 Montreal Olympics theme for an investigative article
- Academic musicology research cross-referencing digital archives to identify French composers with film industry ties and Olympic event contributions
- Film production due diligence automating the validation of composer credentials against studio affiliation and sports event participation data
- Cultural heritage cataloging of Olympic ceremony musicians and their film studio backgrounds for a museum’s interactive composer exhibit
- Human resources screening for a scoring role by scanning candidate bios against multi-criteria including nationality, studio work, and major event credits
- Legal IP rights assessment tracing composer-studio relationships and event contributions to resolve royalty distribution disputes
- Marketing analysis of brand partnerships by mapping composer associations between movie studios and Olympic sponsorship campaigns

### Development Step 18: Search for French Pioneer Pictures composers of 1976 Montreal Olympics theme music

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements and search for alternative composers who both worked for Pioneer Pictures and composed theme music for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. The previous research focused on André Mathieu who was born in Canada, not France, which doesn't match the TASK criteria. Search for other composers associated with the 1976 Montreal Olympics who might have French origins and Pioneer Pictures connections, including any secondary composers, arrangers, or musicians involved in the Olympic ceremonies who had film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Music archivists performing provenance research to confirm which French-born composer associated with Pioneer Pictures created the 1976 Montreal Olympics theme for accurate library cataloging
- Film historians verifying composer credits and studio affiliations in digital movie databases to correct misattributed Pioneer Pictures soundtracks
- Cultural studies researchers analyzing the influence of French composers in major international events for an academic paper on transnational music heritage
- Documentary producers gathering verified biographical details on Olympic ceremony composers of French origin to ensure factual accuracy in a 1976 Montreal retrospective
- Legal teams conducting due diligence on composer nationality and film studio connections to secure proper rights for reissuing archival Olympic recordings
- Event programmers curating a concert series of historic Olympic music who need precise composer–studio links to draft program notes and secure performance permissions
- Metadata specialists automating enrichment of digital archives by extracting nationality, studio affiliation, and event involvement for each composer’s record
- Educational content developers building an interactive timeline of Olympic opening ceremonies, highlighting French-born composers with Pioneer Pictures backgrounds for an online history module

### Development Step 17: Search French-Origin Pioneer Pictures Composers of 1976 Montreal Olympics Theme Music.

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements and search for alternative composers who both worked for Pioneer Pictures and composed theme music for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. The previous research focused on André Mathieu who was born in Canada, not France, which doesn't match the TASK criteria. Search for other composers associated with the 1976 Montreal Olympics who might have French origins and Pioneer Pictures connections, including any secondary composers, arrangers, or musicians involved in the Olympic ceremonies who had film industry backgrounds.

**Use Cases**:
- Film archival teams automating the cross-referencing of composer credits between Pioneer Pictures archives and the 1976 Montreal Olympic ceremony records
- Academic musicology researchers compiling a dataset of French-born composers who scored Olympic event music for a doctoral thesis
- Sports event organizers scouting composers with prior Olympic ceremony experience and film studio backgrounds for upcoming opening ceremonies
- Music licensing departments automating the identification of copyright holders of Olympic theme tracks produced by Pioneer Pictures–affiliated French artists
- Cultural heritage institutions enriching digital archives by linking Pioneer Pictures film scores to Montreal 1976 Olympic ceremonies through web-based search analysis
- Documentary producers sourcing interview candidates by finding secondary or orchestration composers involved in the 1976 Olympics music team with French origins
- Genealogy researchers tracing the career trajectories of French-emigrant composers who worked for Pioneer Pictures and contributed to major sporting event soundtracks
- Music festival programmers curating themed concert series featuring Olympic compositions by French film composers, using automated search to uncover obscure artist names

### Development Step 18: Comprehensive List of Fiona Apple and Paula Cole Pre-1999 Releases with Exact Dates

**Description**: Research and compile a comprehensive list of all albums released by Fiona Apple and Paula Cole before 1999, including their exact release dates and album titles. Focus on their studio albums, EPs, and any other significant releases during this timeframe. Use multiple music databases, discographies, and reliable sources to ensure completeness.

**Use Cases**:
- Music journalism research and fact-checking for a print or online feature on Fiona Apple and Paula Cole’s early careers
- Academic musicology study comparing pre-1999 release patterns of female singer-songwriters for a conference paper
- Streaming service editorial playlist automation to assemble “90s Female Icons” collection with exact release dates
- Music licensing department catalog verification to prepare accurate metadata for sync royalty negotiations
- Record label archival project to validate and update master release information before a deluxe reissue campaign
- Fan site backend automation to generate dynamic discography pages with verified release dates and confidence indicators
- Data analytics for a market research firm examining 1990s album release trends to forecast revival of vintage catalogs

This directly answers the PLAN objective - Dennis Flemion filled in as keyboardist for The_Family_(band). However, the output became corrupted with unrelated priesthood restoration content, suggesting either API response contamination or code execution interference. The essential finding is buried in the mixed output: Dennis Flemion of The Frogs was Jonathan Melvoin's replacement in The Family. PLAN alignment: 90% complete - the answer was found but needs clean extraction. Recommendation: Extract and document the specific finding about Dennis Flemion being Melvoin's replacement, then save a clean summary to workspace/frogs_family_connection_found.txt with just the relevant information.",
