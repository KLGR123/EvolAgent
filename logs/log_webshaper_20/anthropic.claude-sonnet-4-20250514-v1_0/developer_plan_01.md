# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_20  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-07 04:40:15

## Plan Content
```
Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify a composer whose musical piece requires orchestration with four separate brass ensembles and over 400 total performers. Search using keywords including 'composer four brass ensembles 400 performers', 'orchestral work four brass groups massive orchestra', 'classical music 400+ musicians four brass sections', and 'large scale orchestral composition multiple brass ensembles'. Focus on identifying composers known for extremely large-scale orchestral works that would require such massive instrumentation, such as Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, or other late Romantic/early Modern composers.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific composer whose work requires this unique and massive orchestration with four separate brass ensembles and over 400 performers, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to determine which composer created such an extraordinarily large-scale work, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to then search for the critical edition of their works and the specific editor who published Bizet translations and arranged Weber's Freischütz for Paris Opéra in 1841

### Development Step 3: Post-1977 20th-Century Malko Competition Winners: Names, Years, Nationalities (Including Defunct States)

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated compilation of Malko Competition winners by nationality for a musicology research paper on post-1977 European conductor trends
- Cultural heritage data enrichment in a digital library to tag and cross-reference 20th-century competition laureates
- Historical geopolitical analysis of USSR and Yugoslavian artists for a Cold War-era performing arts exhibition catalogue
- University curriculum development tool that aggregates real-world competition results to build case studies in conducting courses
- Classical music streaming platform feature that auto-generates artist profiles with competition wins and former-country origins
- Grant-writing support system for arts foundations, pre-filling applicant profiles with past prize data sorted by year and historical nationality
- Automated archival metadata creation for national music archives, extracting structured winner records from public web sources

### Development Step 4: Compile All Post-1977 Malko Competition Winners with Nationalities, Including Defunct Countries

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Archiving and trend analysis for music historians mapping post-1977 Malko Competition winners by nationality and geopolitical context
- Classical music database enrichment with automated extraction of winner names, years, and historical country tags for digital library platforms
- Academic research into Cold War–era cultural exchanges, using detailed Malko Competition data for musicology theses on geopolitical influences
- Museum exhibition curation displaying Malko Competition laureates from defunct states (USSR, Yugoslavia, etc.) to illustrate 20th-century political shifts
- Government cultural policy evaluation assessing how nation-state transformations impacted participation and success rates in international music contests
- University course material development, creating interactive timelines of Malko Competition winners tied to historical country changes for world history or music studies
- Record label marketing analytics identifying award-winning artists’ regional origins and historical backgrounds to drive targeted promotional campaigns

### Development Step 1: 20th Century Post-1977 Malko Competition Winners with Nationalities: Comprehensive Data Compilation

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic musicology research on post-1977 Malko Competition winners to analyze Cold War era nationality trends among laureates from former Soviet and Eastern Bloc states
- Digital library and archive curation workflows automating extraction and integration of Malko Competition winner metadata (names, years, defunct-country nationalities) into institutional catalogs
- Cultural policy assessment by government arts councils using historical winner data to evaluate the evolution of artistic support for musicians from now-dissolved states like Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia
- Museum and exhibition planning teams sourcing chronological recipient lists to create interactive displays on classical music heritage and geopolitical change from 1978 to 2000
- Music journalism and editorial projects compiling comprehensive timelines of Malko laureates for feature articles, anniversary retrospectives, and documentary scripts
- Library management system enhancements leveraging automated scraping routines to maintain up-to-date competition records and link laureate profiles across successor states of the former USSR
- Data journalism investigations visualizing shifts in international competition representation by mapping winner nationalities against historical state boundaries
- Grant evaluation committees benchmarking past competition winners’ trajectories by nationality to design equitable selection criteria for emerging classical musicians

    "description": "Starting comprehensive web search to identify a composer whose work requires four separate brass ensembles and over 400 total performers. This initial phase implements a dual-strategy approach: (1) If SerpAPI key is available, execute targeted Google searches using specific keywords like 'composer four brass ensembles 400 performers', 'Mahler Symphony 8 brass ensembles', etc. (2) If no API key, perform direct searches to classical music resources including Wikipedia pages for large orchestral works and composer catalogs. The code analyzes each source for brass ensemble mentions, large performer numbers (400+), and relevant composer names (Mahler, Strauss, Berlioz, Wagner). All search results and content are saved to workspace/ for detailed analysis. This approach focuses on identifying works like Mahler's Symphony No. 8 'Symphony of a Thousand' or Strauss's Alpine Symphony that are known for requiring massive orchestral forces with multiple brass sections.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - SerpAPI rate limiting blocked all search attempts. The code encountered HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors for all 7 search queries, preventing any data collection. While the code structure and logic are sound, the SerpAPI key appears to be rate-limited or quota-exceeded, so no search results were obtained. The code did create a results file 'workspace_webshaper_20/serpapi_composer_search.json' but it likely contains empty results. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no composer identification completed due to API limitations. Recommended fix: The code has a fallback mechanism for direct web scraping when SerpAPI fails, but it only triggers when the API key is missing, not when rate-limited. Modify the code to detect 429 errors and automatically fall back to the direct web scraping approach that searches Wikipedia and IMSLP directly for large orchestral works.",

    "description": "Implementing fallback direct web scraping strategy after SerpAPI rate limiting failure. This approach directly accesses key classical music resources including Wikipedia pages for 'Symphony of a Thousand' (Mahler's Symphony No. 8), 'An Alpine Symphony' (Strauss), and other large orchestral works. The code systematically analyzes each page for: (1) Brass ensemble mentions and patterns indicating 'four brass' or 'multiple brass' sections, (2) Large performer numbers (400+) using regex patterns, (3) Relevant composer names (Mahler, Strauss, Berlioz, Wagner), (4) Specific work titles known for massive orchestration. Each source gets a relevance score based on weighted criteria, with detailed analysis of the top result including extraction of instrumentation details, four brass ensemble references, and 400+ performer mentions. All content is saved to workspace/ files for comprehensive analysis. This direct approach bypasses API limitations while targeting the most likely sources for identifying composers whose works require four separate brass ensembles and over 400 total performers.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed the fallback web scraping approach after the previous SerpAPI rate limiting failure. The script accessed 6 out of 7 target URLs and generated comprehensive analysis results. **Key findings**: Identified Hector Berlioz's 'Grande messe des morts' (Requiem) as the top candidate with a relevance score of 60.5, featuring 33 brass mentions and 10 'four brass' pattern matches. The detailed analysis confirmed this work requires 'four antiphonal offstage brass ensembles' as specified in the instrumentation details. However, the search did not find explicit mentions of 400+ performers in the scraped content. **PLAN** alignment: 75% - successfully identified a composer (Berlioz) with a work requiring four separate brass ensembles, but missing the 400+ performer confirmation. The comprehensive search results are saved to 'workspace_webshaper_20/direct_composer_search_results.json' with detailed analysis data. Recommendation: The search has identified the most likely candidate (Berlioz - Grande messe des morts), but consider searching for more specific performer count information or examining the saved HTML files for additional instrumentation details that might contain the 400+ performer requirement.",

    "description": "Conducting detailed verification analysis of the identified top candidate - Berlioz's Grande messe des morts (Requiem). This phase loads and thoroughly analyzes the saved HTML content to confirm both requirements: (1) Four separate brass ensembles, and (2) 400+ total performers. The code first inspects the search results file structure, then performs comprehensive pattern matching on the Berlioz HTML content using enhanced regex patterns for 'four brass ensembles', 'antiphonal brass', 'offstage brass', and various large performer number formats (400+). It searches through instrumentation sections, performance contexts, and historical documentation to extract specific evidence. The analysis includes contextual searches around keywords like 'premiere', 'performance', 'recording' to find performer counts, and detailed instrumentation breakdowns. Results are compiled into a verification summary with confidence levels and saved to workspace/berlioz_requiem_verification.json. This systematic approach aims to definitively confirm whether Berlioz's Requiem meets both the four brass ensembles and 400+ performer criteria specified in the PLAN.",

The detailed examination of the saved HTML content successfully confirmed BOTH requirements from the **PLAN**: (1) Four brass ensembles requirement: ✓ CONFIRMED with 12 specific references found including 'four brass ensemble', 'four antiphonal offstage brass ensemble', and 'four brass choir'. (2) 400+ performers requirement: ✓ CONFIRMED with numbers [800, 400] found in the content. The analysis produced a definitive answer identifying Hector Berlioz as the composer whose Grande messe des morts (Requiem), Op. 5 (1837) requires four separate antiphonal brass ensembles and 800+ total performers. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - both criteria fully satisfied. The verification results are comprehensively documented in 'workspace_webshaper_20/berlioz_requiem_verification.json'.

Through comprehensive web scraping and detailed HTML content analysis, I have definitively identified the composer and work that meets both specified requirements:\n\n**FINAL ANSWER:**\n- **COMPOSER:** Hector Berlioz\n- **WORK:** Grande messe des morts (Requiem), Op. 5 (1837)\n\n**VERIFICATION RESULTS:**\n1. **Four Brass Ensembles Requirement:** ✓ CONFIRMED with 12 specific references found, including 'four brass ensemble', 'four antiphonal offstage brass ensemble', and 'four brass choir'. The work is specifically scored for four separate brass ensembles positioned antiphonally.\n\n2. **400+ Performers Requirement:** ✓ CONFIRMED with documented numbers of 800 and 400 performers found in the Wikipedia content analysis.\n\n**Research Process Summary:**\n- Initial SerpAPI search failed due to rate limiting (HTTP 429)\n- Successfully implemented fallback direct web scraping of 6 classical music resources\n- Berlioz's Grande messe des morts emerged as top candidate with relevance score of 60.5\n- Detailed HTML content analysis confirmed both requirements definitively\n- All research data and verification results saved to workspace files\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `workspace/direct_composer_search_results.json` - Complete search results and analysis\n- `workspace/berlioz_requiem_verification.json` - Final verification summary\n- `workspace/Grande_messe_des_morts.html` - Source Wikipedia content\n\nThe research has achieved 100% PLAN alignment by successfully identifying Hector Berlioz as the composer whose Grande messe des morts requires four separate brass ensembles and over 400 total performers, making it one of the largest orchestral works in the classical repertoire.",
