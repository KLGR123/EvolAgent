### Who Was the 1879 Non-Voting Congressional Delegate from Territory with First Public High School?

**TASK**: Who was elected as a non-voting delegate to the U.S. Congress in 1879 from a territory that established its first public high school in 1879, the building of which later housed the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office?

```

    "plan": "Research U.S. territories that established their first public high school in 1879 and identify which territory elected a non-voting delegate to Congress that same year. Focus on territorial histories, educational milestones, and congressional delegation records from 1879. Look for connections between early territorial high schools and later medical facilities, specifically any buildings that housed the New Mexico Heart Institute's billing office.",

The research produced comprehensive documentation including territorial_research_1879_complete.json (complete research data with historical verification) and territorial_research_1879_summary.txt (executive summary report). All three criteria converge on New Mexico Territory with strong historical connections spanning from the 1879 territorial era to the modern medical facility.
