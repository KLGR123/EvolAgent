## Final Answer
```
Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Decrypt a Caesar cipher message 'Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.' to reveal the picnic meeting location, requiring systematic cryptographic analysis and clear English output. All three members employed identical and methodologically sound approaches: (1) Member 1 systematically tested all 25 possible shift values, identified shift 10 as correct, and produced the decryption 'Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.' with readability scoring validation, (2) Member 2 used the same systematic shift testing methodology, confirmed shift 10 through character-by-character transformation analysis, and verified uniqueness by comparing adjacent shift values, (3) Member 3 applied identical systematic decryption across all shift values 1-25, confirmed shift 10 as optimal, and validated through complete character verification. Convergence analysis shows perfect agreement across all members on both methodology and final result, with all three independently reaching 'Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.' through rigorous cryptographic analysis. No contradictions exist between approaches - all used systematic shift testing and proper Caesar cipher decryption principles. Cross-validation confirms the decryption accuracy: Z→P, s→i, m→c, x→n, s→i, m→c (shift 10 consistently applied). The decrypted message forms grammatically correct English identifying a specific location. Integration assessment reveals all members demonstrated equivalent technical competency and analytical rigor. Final validation: The answer 'Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.' represents a complete, coherent English sentence that directly answers the task requirement of revealing the encrypted meeting location.
