## Final Answer
```
7
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Determine the count of Rick Riordan books not currently available on Scribe County Public Library shelves by analyzing the provided PDF file. All three team members executed identical systematic approaches with complete convergence on methodology and results. Member evaluation: All members (0, 1, 2) successfully parsed the PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/e9a2c537-8232-4c3f-85b0-b52de6bcba99.pdf, identified exactly 9 Rick Riordan books in the library collection, and correctly determined availability status for each book. Cross-analysis shows perfect agreement: all members found 2 books available on shelves (The Lightning Thief, The Titan's Curse) and 7 books not available (5 'Checked Out' + 2 'Overdue'). Methodological assessment: Each member used appropriate PDF parsing techniques, implemented correct data extraction logic, and applied proper filtering criteria to distinguish between available and unavailable books. All members resolved initial parsing challenges and verified their results through comprehensive data validation. Synthesis validation: The unanimous finding of 7 unavailable Rick Riordan books is supported by consistent identification of the same specific titles across all analyses. Quality assurance confirms this represents books marked as 'Checked Out' (The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Lost Hero, The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena) and 'Overdue' (The House of Hades, The Blood of Olympus). Confidence level: Maximum, based on perfect inter-member consistency and thorough verification processes.
