I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won&#x27;t buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here&#x27;s the list I have so far:<br><br>milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts<br><br>I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won&#x27;t get them when she&#x27;s at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.<br><br>Retrieved Episodic Memory Examples:<br>### Which City Has Higher Total Sales: Wharvton or Algrimand?<br><br>**TASK**: The attached spreadsheet contains the sales of menu items for a regional fast-food chain.

I\&#x27;ve provided a comprehensive implementation that researches and analyzes the Unlambda programming language, with specific focus on understanding syntax for outputting text strings like &quot;For penguins&quot;.\n\nThe code successfully created:\n1. A syntax reference document explaining Unlambda\&#x27;s core operators and principles\n2. A &quot;Hello, World!&quot; example with detailed explanation\n3. Two different implementations for outputting &quot;For penguins&quot; in Unlambda\n4. Additional examples showing different output patterns\n5. A comprehensive summary of findings\n\nThe key finding is that in Unlambda, to output a text string like &quot;For penguins&quot;, we use the `.c` operator to print each character and chain these operations using the backtick (`) application operator. The complete solution is:\n``.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i\n\nAs confirmed by the tester\&#x27;s feedback, the code executed successfully and fully met the requirements specified in the PLAN. All necessary files were generated in the workspace directory, and the implementation thoroughly demonstrates how to create Unlambda code that outputs the desired text string.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. After analyzing the Unlambda code, I&#x27;ve identified that the exact character needed to fix the code is the backtick (`). The given code lacks backticks between the dot operators. In Unlambda, `.c` prints character c, but these operations need to be connected with backticks (`) as application operators. The correct format should be: `.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i. Final answer: backtick&quot;,<br>}<br>```<br><br>```<br><br><br>``.F.o.r. .p.e.n.g.u.i.n.si<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>```<br><br>### Furthest ASEAN Capital Distance: Two Countries, Alphabetically Ordered<br><br>**TASK**: In terms of geographical distance between capital cities, which 2 countries are the furthest from each other within the ASEAN bloc according to wikipedia?

Extract precise geographical data needed for distance calculations between all possible capital city pairs.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the complete list of ASEAN member countries and their capitals before calculating distances, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain accurate geographical coordinates for all ASEAN capitals from Wikipedia, (4) This provides the foundation needed to determine which two countries have capitals that are geographically furthest apart within the bloc&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The PLAN has been successfully completed! I have systematically searched Wikipedia for comprehensive information about ASEAN member countries and their capitals, achieving 100% of the objectives:\n\n**COMPLETED OBJECTIVES:**\n1. ✓ Identified all 10 ASEAN member nations: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam\n2. ✓ Confirmed their respective capital cities: Bandar Seri Begawan, Phnom Penh, Jakarta, Vientiane, Kuala Lumpur, Naypyidaw, Manila, Singapore, Bangkok, and Hanoi\n3. ✓ Extracted precise geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) for each capital city with 100% success rate\n4. ✓ Used systematic Wikipedia search approaches as specified in the PLAN\n5. ✓ Created comprehensive dataset ready for distance calculations between all possible capital city pairs\n\n**SEARCH METHODOLOGY IMPLEMENTED:**\n- Accessed main ASEAN Wikipedia page to identify member countries\n- Analyzed HTML table structures to extract country information\n- Applied known ASEAN capitals from authoritative sources\n- Systematically accessed individual capital city Wikipedia pages\n- Used multiple coordinate extraction methods for robust data collection\n\n**FINAL OUTPUT:**\nCreated &#x27;workspace/asean_complete_coordinates.json&#x27; containing complete geographical data for all 10 ASEAN capitals:\n- Brunei (Bandar Seri Begawan): 4.89°N, 114.94°E\n- Cambodia (Phnom Penh): 11.57°N, 104.92°E\n- Indonesia (Jakarta): -6.18°S, 106.83°E\n- Laos (Vientiane): 17.98°N, 102.63°E\n- Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur): 3.15°N, 101.70°E\n- Myanmar (Naypyidaw): 19.75°N, 96.12°E\n- Philippines (Manila): 14.60°N, 120.98°E\n- Singapore (Singapore): 1.28°N, 103.83°E\n- Thailand (Bangkok): 13.75°N, 100.49°E\n- Vietnam (Hanoi): 21.00°N, 105.85°E\n\nThe extracted data is now complete and ready for any required distance calculations between all possible ASEAN capital city pairs. All PLAN requirements have been fulfilled successfully.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Calculate the geographical distances between all possible pairs of ASEAN capital cities using the coordinate data from workspace/asean_complete_coordinates.json. Apply the haversine formula to compute great circle distances between each pair of capitals, then identify which two countries have the maximum distance between their capital cities. Create a comprehensive distance matrix showing all pairwise distances and determine the two ASEAN member countries whose capitals are geographically furthest apart.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have complete geographical coordinates for all 10 ASEAN capitals from the previous Wikipedia research, (2) The core question requires identifying the two countries with maximum capital-to-capital distance, (3) Expected outcome is to calculate all pairwise distances and identify the maximum distance pair, (4) This directly addresses the main TASK requirement to find the two furthest countries within the ASEAN bloc&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;The PLAN has been successfully completed in full. The analysis calculated geographical distances between all possible pairs of ASEAN capital cities using the haversine formula and identified the maximum distance pair. \n\n**COMPLETE RESULTS:**\n- **Total calculations**: 45 unique pairwise distances between 10 ASEAN capitals\n- **Method**: Haversine formula for great circle distance calculations\n- **Maximum distance identified**: 3,111.7 kilometers between Jakarta, Indonesia and Naypyidaw, Myanmar\n- **Answer to PLAN**: The two ASEAN member countries whose capitals are geographically furthest apart are **Indonesia** and **Myanmar**\n\n**FILES CREATED:**\n- `workspace/asean_distance_matrix_complete.json`: Contains comprehensive analysis results including all 45 pairwise distances sorted by distance, maximum distance details, and complete coordinate data\n\n**VERIFICATION OF COMPLETENESS:**\n✓ Loaded coordinate data from workspace/asean_complete_coordinates.json\n✓ Applied haversine formula to compute great circle distances\n✓ Calculated all possible pairs (45 pairs for 10 countries)\n✓ Created comprehensive distance matrix showing all pairwise distances\n✓ Identified the two countries with maximum distance (Indonesia and Myanmar)\n✓ Saved complete results with detailed analysis\n\nThe tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with successful execution and complete objective achievement. All requirements have been fulfilled and the geographical analysis is complete.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;Task completed successfully.
