## Task Description
```
I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.

### Which City Has Higher Total Sales: Wharvton or Algrimand?

**TASK**: The attached spreadsheet contains the sales of menu items for a regional fast-food chain. Which city had the greater total sales: Wharvton or Algrimand? Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/7cc4acfa-63fd-4acc-a1a1-e8e529e0a97f.xlsx

Identify the data structure including column headers and city organization, then calculate the total sales for Wharvton and Algrimand specifically to determine which city had greater total sales.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the Excel file structure and identify all sales data organized by city before comparing Wharvton and Algrimand totals, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete sales data with clear city identification and calculated totals for both target cities, (4) This provides the foundation needed to directly answer which city had greater total sales as requested in the TASK',

### Unlambda code: which character to add to output “For penguins”?

**TASK**: In Unlambda, what exact charcter or text needs to be added to correct the following code to output "For penguins"? If what is needed is a character, answer with the name of the character. If there are different names for the character, use the shortest. The text location is not needed. Code:

`r
{
    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": 'Research and analyze the Unlambda programming language to understand its syntax, specifically focusing on code structure that would output text strings like "For penguins".',
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand Unlambda's syntax to identify what's missing in the given code, (2) No prior research has been done on this language yet, (3) Expected outcome is to gain sufficient knowledge about Unlambda to analyze the provided code snippet, (4) Understanding the language fundamentals is critical before we can determine what character needs to be added to fix the code.",

    "code": '<END>',
    "description": 'The task has been successfully completed. I\'ve provided a comprehensive implementation that researches and analyzes the Unlambda programming language, with specific focus on understanding syntax for outputting text strings like "For penguins".\n\nThe code successfully created:\n1. A syntax reference document explaining Unlambda\'s core operators and principles\n2. A "Hello, World!" example with detailed explanation\n3. Two different implementations for outputting "For penguins" in Unlambda\n4. Additional examples showing different output patterns\n5. A comprehensive summary of findings\n\nThe key finding is that in Unlambda, to output a text string like "For penguins", we use the `.c` operator to print each character and chain these operations using the backtick (`) application operator. The complete solution is:\n``.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i\n\nAs confirmed by the tester\'s feedback, the code executed successfully and fully met the requirements specified in the PLAN. All necessary files were generated in the workspace directory, and the implementation thoroughly demonstrates how to create Unlambda code that outputs the desired text string.',

    "description": "Task completed successfully. After analyzing the Unlambda code, I've identified that the exact character needed to fix the code is the backtick (`). The given code lacks backticks between the dot operators. In Unlambda, `.c` prints character c, but these operations need to be connected with backticks (`) as application operators. The correct format should be: `.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i. Final answer: backtick",
