## Final Answer
```
broccoli, celery, fresh basil, lettuce, sweet potatoes
```

## Reasoning
```
1) Task decomposition and success criteria: Identify only botanical vegetables (non‐fruit plant parts: roots, leaves, stems, flowers) from the given list and alphabetize them in a comma‐separated format. 2) Individual member evaluation: Member 0 (Index 0) produced the correct set but without methodological detail; Member 1 (Index 1) omitted fresh basil, thus incomplete; Member 2 (Index 2) conducted comprehensive botanical classification, explicitly excluded botanical fruits (green beans, bell pepper, zucchini, etc.), and correctly assembled and alphabetized the five true vegetables. 3) Cross-analysis: Both Member 0 and Member 2 converged on the same correct list, whereas Member 1 missed fresh basil. 4) Synthesis: Adopted Member 2’s rigorous classification to confirm that fresh basil (leaves), broccoli (flowers), celery (stalks), lettuce (leaves), and sweet potatoes (roots) are the only true vegetables, and alphabetized accordingly. 5) Final validation: Verified against botanical definitions that no fruit structures (ovary‐derived seed‐bearing items) are included. 6) Confidence assessment: High confidence based on clear botanical criteria and consensus among top contributors.
