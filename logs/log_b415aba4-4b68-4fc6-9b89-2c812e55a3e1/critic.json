  "final_answer": "quantum dots",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify a nano-compound studied in a 2012 Nature Scientific Reports article that doesn't mention plasmons/plasmonics, excluding any 'nano' prefix. Member 1 conducted systematic analysis of Scientific Reports 2012 conference proceedings, identifying 4 articles total with 3 mentioning plasmons/plasmonics and 1 that studied nano-compounds without these mentions: 'Diamond photonic crystal slab: Leaky modes and modified photoluminescence emission of surface-deposited quantum dots'. Through detailed extraction and verification, Member 1 identified 'quantum dots' as the studied nano-compound. Member 2 found a different article 'Unraveling the interlayer-related phonon self-energy renormalization in bilayer graphene' and concluded 'graphene' as the answer. Member 3 identified 'Inoculation of silicon nanoparticles with silver atoms' and concluded 'silicon' as the answer. Cross-analysis reveals major divergence on article identification. Critical examination shows Member 1's approach was most methodologically sound - they specifically focused on 'conference proceedings' as required in the task, while Members 2 and 3 searched more broadly for any Scientific Reports articles from 2012. The task specifically asked about Scientific Reports conference proceedings, not just any article from the journal. Member 1's approach properly identified the conference proceedings and systematically analyzed all articles within that specific collection. Verification confirms 'quantum dots' as the correct nano-compound studied in the non-plasmon article from the conference proceedings. Both other members' results likely came from regular journal articles rather than conference proceedings.",
