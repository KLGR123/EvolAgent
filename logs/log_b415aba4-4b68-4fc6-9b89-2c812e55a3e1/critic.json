  "reason": "Task analysis: Locate Nature Scientific Reports 2012 conference proceedings article studying nano-compounds without plasmon/plasmonic mentions, then identify the specific nano-compound (removing nano prefix). Individual evaluation: Member 1 identified multiple articles but focused on regular journal articles rather than conference proceedings specifically, ultimately selecting 'Boron Nitride' from a general search. Member 2 found a nanotube study but also appeared to analyze regular articles rather than conference proceedings, concluding with 'tube'. Member 3 conducted the most methodologically rigorous approach by: (1) Specifically targeting conference proceedings using direct Nature URL (https://www.nature.com/srep/articles?type=conference-proceeding&year=2012), (2) Systematically analyzing all 4 Scientific Reports 2012 conference proceedings articles, (3) Applying dual criteria filtering for nano-compounds AND absence of plasmon content, (4) Identifying Article 2 ('Diamond photonic crystal slab: Leaky modes and modified photoluminescence emission of surface-deposited quantum dots') as the only qualifying article, (5) Extracting 'nanocrystal' as the specific compound studied (6 mentions in full text). Cross-analysis reveals divergence in search methodology - Members 1 and 2 searched general Scientific Reports articles while Member 3 specifically targeted conference proceedings as required by the task. Convergence exists in all members finding nano-compound studies from 2012 Scientific Reports. Member 3's approach demonstrates superior task comprehension by recognizing that 'conference proceedings' represents a distinct publication category requiring targeted search. Final validation confirms Member 3's identification of 'nanocrystal' (answer: 'crystal' without nano prefix) from the conference proceedings article that contains zero plasmon references while extensively studying nanocrystalline materials.",
