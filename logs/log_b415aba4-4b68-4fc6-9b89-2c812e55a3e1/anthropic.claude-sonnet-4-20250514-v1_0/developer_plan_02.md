# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** b415aba4-4b68-4fc6-9b89-2c812e55a3e1  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 20:03:21

## Plan Content
```
Analyze the identified Scientific Reports 2012 article 'Diamond photonic crystal slab: Leaky modes and modified photoluminescence emission of surface-deposited quantum dots' to extract the specific nano-compound being studied. Parse the full article content from workspace/scientific_reports_2012_comprehensive_analysis.json and workspace/conference_articles_details.json to identify the exact nano-compound mentioned in this research, ensuring to remove any 'nano' prefix from the final answer as requested in the TASK.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The developer successfully identified the target article that studies nano-compounds without mentioning plasmons/plasmonics, (2) We have the article title and know it focuses on quantum dots and diamond structures, but need to extract the specific nano-compound name, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the precise nano-compound terminology used in the research, (4) This will provide the final answer needed to complete the TASK requirement

Following the TASK requirement to remove any 'nano' prefix, the final answer will be extracted appropriately. Since 'quantum dots' doesn't have a 'nano' prefix, it remains 'quantum dots'.
