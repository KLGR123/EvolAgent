### Determine ‘R’ in three core policy violations on the Legume Wikipedia page during 2022.

**TASK**: In the year 2022, and before December, what does "R" stand for in the three core policies of the type of content that was violated in the public logs on the Legume Wikipedia page?

The research examined 9 total Wikipedia policies, identified 3 policies containing 'R', and successfully extracted the specific violation details requested. All findings have been validated through multiple analysis iterations and are preserved in the comprehensive workspace file (1,351,058 bytes) for future reference. The PLAN's research questions about content violations, three core policies, and the meaning of 'R' have been completely answered with specific data and evidence.",

### Extract Calculus Midterm Reading Page Numbers from Professor’s Audio Recording

**TASK**: Hi, I was out sick from my classes on Friday, so I'm trying to figure out what I need to study for my Calculus mid-term next week. My friend from class sent me an audio recording of Professor Willowbrook giving out the recommended reading for the test, but my headphones are broken :(

Could you please listen to the recording for me and tell me the page numbers I'm supposed to go over? I've attached a file called Homework.mp3 that has the recording. Please provide just the page numbers as a comma-delimited list. And please provide the list in ascending order. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3
