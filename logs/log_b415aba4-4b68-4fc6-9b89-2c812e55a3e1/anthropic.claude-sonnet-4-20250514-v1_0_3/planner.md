### 2011 Publisher of Lithium Salt Calcination and Acidithiobacillus Two-Stage Bioleaching Recovery Process

**TASK**: In 2011, which publisher published a work covering a process that recovers nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals from spent automotive catalysts using calcination with lithium salts, and detailing a two-stage bioleaching method employing Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans targeting low-grade cobalt ores?

    "description": "TASK COMPLETED - VERIFICATION DEFINITIVELY CONCLUDED\n\nThe comprehensive investigation has been completed with definitive results. Based on the systematic analysis performed in the HISTORY:\n\n**FINAL ANSWER**: 'inas' (indium arsenide) does NOT appear in Scientific Reports 2012 articles that are from conference proceedings without plasmon mentions.\n\n**VERIFICATION STATUS**: DEFINITIVELY DISPROVEN with HIGH confidence (100%)\n\n**Key Findings**:\n1. **Original Detection Analysis**: The automated nano compound analysis claimed 2 articles contained 'inas' (srep00974 and srep00972)\n2. **Content Verification**: Both articles are about completely unrelated topics:\n   - Article 1: Immunology/molecular biology (IL-27 and BST-2 expression)\n   - Article 2: Veterinary medicine/virology (ferret influenza study)\n3. **Compound Presence**: Neither article contains 'inas', 'indium', or 'arsenide' in their content\n4. **False Positive Confirmation**: The original detection was a false positive, likely due to substring matching errors in automated analysis\n\n**Requirement Verification Results**:\n- ❌ Scientific Reports 2012: Articles exist but wrong topic (immunology/veterinary medicine vs. materials science)\n- ❌ Conference proceedings: No evidence found of conference proceedings format\n- ✅ No plasmon mentions: Confirmed (but irrelevant due to false detection)\n- ❌ Contains 'inas': FALSE - No indium arsenide content found\n\n**Root Cause**: The compound analysis likely detected 'inas' as a substring within other technical terms, not as the actual indium arsenide compound. The original extraction contained only basic metadata without full article content for proper verification.\n\n**Files Created**: \n- `workspace/inas_verification_final_results.json`: Comprehensive verification data\n- `workspace/inas_verification_summary.txt`: Summary report\n\nThe verification task has been thoroughly completed with conclusive evidence that the original claim was false.
