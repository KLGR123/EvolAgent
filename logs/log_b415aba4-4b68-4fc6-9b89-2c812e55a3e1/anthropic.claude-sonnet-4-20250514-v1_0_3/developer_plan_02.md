# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** b415aba4-4b68-4fc6-9b89-2c812e55a3e1  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-06 16:44:23

## Plan Content
```
Access the complete text of the 23 identified Scientific Reports 2012 articles that study nano-compounds and do not mention plasmons/plasmonics. Download and analyze each article's full content to determine which specific nano-compound is studied in each paper. Extract the exact nano-compound names from the methodology, results, and abstract sections of each article to identify the target compound mentioned in the TASK.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The previous search successfully identified 23 candidate articles from Scientific Reports 2012 that study nano-compounds without mentioning plasmons/plasmonics, (2) We have the list of target articles but need to examine their full content to identify the specific nano-compounds studied, (3) Expected outcome is to extract the exact nano-compound names from each article's content, (4) This will allow us to identify which specific nano-compound the TASK is referring to among the 23 candidates

### Development Step 3: Confirm 2011 Extractive Metallurgy of Ni, Co, PGM Includes Lithium Calcination and Two-Stage Bioleaching

**Description**: Verify the identified 2011 Elsevier publication 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by conducting a targeted search to confirm it specifically covers both the calcination process with lithium salts for recovering metals from spent automotive catalysts AND the two-stage bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for low-grade cobalt ores. Search for the book's table of contents, chapter summaries, or detailed reviews that explicitly mention these two specific processes. Cross-reference with academic databases, publisher catalogs, and technical literature citations to ensure this publication contains both required methodologies described in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Patent due diligence for materials science: verifying that a 2022 WO patent application covers both reinforced polymer composites and flame-retardant additive processing steps by targeted SerpAPI queries to patent office and scholarly sources
- Pharmaceutical guideline confirmation: ensuring the 2020 WHO monograph explicitly includes renal dosage adjustment protocols and adverse reaction monitoring procedures by searching chapter summaries and section titles
- Automotive supplier audit: confirming an ISO/TS 16949 supplier manual online covers both heat-treatment procedures for chassis parts and corrosion-resistance testing protocols using focused Google searches
- Open-source software compliance check: verifying that a cryptography library’s documentation details both RSA key generation methods and AES-GCM encryption usage via structured search queries on GitHub Pages and developer blogs
- Market intelligence white-paper analysis: ensuring a competitor’s 2021 market study contains consumer behavior segmentation for North America and side-by-side feature comparisons with key rivals by scanning executive summaries and table of contents
- Academic textbook syllabus alignment: confirming a 2023 engineering thermodynamics textbook includes both entropy analysis chapters and exergy efficiency case studies as mandated by a university course outline
- GDPR compliance verification: checking that the EU’s official GDPR guidelines PDF addresses both data subject access rights and data breach notification requirements by targeted searches of section headings and legal commentary
- Environmental impact report validation: verifying that a 2019 EPA assessment document covers both greenhouse gas emission quantification methods and carbon capture technology evaluations through focused online catalog and summary searches

### Development Step 6: Verify 2011 Extractive Metallurgy Book Covers Lithium-Salt Calcination and Two-Stage Bioleaching Methods

**Description**: Verify the identified 2011 Elsevier publication 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by conducting a targeted search to confirm it specifically covers both the calcination process with lithium salts for recovering metals from spent automotive catalysts AND the two-stage bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for low-grade cobalt ores. Search for the book's table of contents, chapter summaries, or detailed reviews that explicitly mention these two specific processes. Cross-reference with academic databases, publisher catalogs, and technical literature citations to ensure this publication contains both required methodologies described in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Patent prior-art verification and targeted confirmation of lithium-salt calcination and bioleaching methods in chemical patent examinations
- Battery recycling R&D literature validation and extraction of calcination with lithium salts for spent automotive catalyst recovery processes
- Metallurgical process adoption risk assessment and cross-referencing of two-stage Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bioleaching protocols in industrial scale-up proposals
- Academic grant proposal due diligence with automated searches to confirm cited Elsevier references include both nickel–cobalt recovery techniques
- Environmental consultancy remediation planning and auditing of published process descriptions for spent catalyst treatment and cobalt ore leaching
- University thesis committee automated reference auditing to ensure textbooks cited in graduate research actually cover specified calcination and bioleaching methods
- Systematic review authors’ bibliometric analysis and methodology mapping of extractive metallurgy approaches across multiple academic and publisher catalogs

### Development Step 4: Verify Elsevier's 'Extractive Metallurgy of Ni, Co, PGM Metals' includes Li-salt calcination, two-stage bioleaching.

**Description**: Verify the identified 2011 Elsevier publication 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by conducting a targeted search to confirm it specifically covers both the calcination process with lithium salts for recovering metals from spent automotive catalysts AND the two-stage bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for low-grade cobalt ores. Search for the book's table of contents, chapter summaries, or detailed reviews that explicitly mention these two specific processes. Cross-reference with academic databases, publisher catalogs, and technical literature citations to ensure this publication contains both required methodologies described in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic library metadata validation for updating institutional repository records with accurate chapter-level details from Elsevier’s 2011 “Extractive Metallurgy” publication
- Research grant proposal verification of cited metallurgical methodologies, ensuring the inclusion of lithium-salt calcination and two-stage bioleaching processes
- Patent office prior-art search to confirm the existence of two-stage Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bioleaching methods before approving new cobalt recovery patents
- Technical due diligence in mining M&A to validate vendor claims about innovative cobalt extraction from low-grade ores using bioleaching and lithium salt calcination
- Environmental consultancy compliance checks ensuring remediation reports reference peer-reviewed processes for recycling spent automotive catalysts
- Systematic literature review in materials science to extract and catalogue specific calcination and bioleaching workflows from Elsevier’s manual
- Publisher quality assurance audit to cross-verify table of contents and chapter summaries against digital platform listings for content accuracy
- Data curation in academic knowledge bases linking verified metallurgical process descriptions to standardized publication identifiers

### Development Step 1: 2011 Nickel, Cobalt, PGM Recovery from Automotive Catalysts via Lithium-Calcination and Bioleaching

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify academic works, technical publications, or books from 2011 that cover hydrometallurgical processes for recovering nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals from spent automotive catalysts. Focus on searching for keywords including '2011 nickel cobalt platinum recovery automotive catalysts', 'calcination lithium salts metal recovery 2011', 'Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bioleaching cobalt 2011', 'two-stage bioleaching low-grade cobalt ores', and 'spent catalyst metal recovery 2011 publisher'. Look for technical books, conference proceedings, journal special issues, or industry publications that detail both the calcination process with lithium salts and the specific bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for cobalt ore processing.

**Use Cases**:
- Mining R&D team conducting a patent and literature landscape analysis on 2011 hydrometallurgical methods for nickel, cobalt, and platinum recovery to inform the development of a new recycling process.
