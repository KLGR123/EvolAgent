    "description": "This implementation conducts a comprehensive search for the 2008 painting 'Embroidery from Uzbekistan' using multiple targeted search strategies. The approach includes: (1) Regular Google searches with 6 different query variations to maximize coverage, (2) Specialized Google Images search to find visual representations, (3) Relevance scoring system that identifies results based on key indicators like title match, year, art terminology, fruit content, and museum sources, (4) Systematic data collection and analysis with all results saved to workspace JSON files for further investigation. The code prioritizes finding high-quality sources (museums, galleries, catalogs) and visual content that would show the fruit arrangements mentioned in the PLAN. Results are ranked by relevance score and the most promising leads are highlighted for manual verification. This establishes a solid foundation for identifying the artist and locating detailed visual representations of the painting's fruit compositions.",

The **CURRENT CODE** is designed to search for information about a 2008 painting titled 'Embroidery from Uzbekistan', but the **CURRENT CODE OUTPUT** shows completely different content about fire stations, Cleveland Elementary School, and Metro connections in Washington DC. This suggests either the wrong code was executed or there was a serious execution environment issue. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no search for the target painting was conducted. The code should be re-run in a clean environment, or the correct code implementation should be verified before execution.

    "description": "This is a clean re-implementation of the search for the 2008 painting 'Embroidery from Uzbekistan'. The code addresses the previous execution environment issue by: (1) Starting with a fresh, focused approach that clearly identifies the target artwork and objectives, (2) Implementing a comprehensive 6-query search strategy covering different aspects (artist, museum catalogs, fruit compositions, exhibitions), (3) Using a sophisticated relevance scoring system that weights title matches, year matches, art terminology, fruit content, institutional sources, and visual indicators, (4) Systematically tracking high-relevance results, potential artist mentions, and visual content sources, (5) Providing detailed progress output with clear categorization of results by relevance score. The implementation includes proper error handling, rate limiting, and comprehensive data saving to workspace files. This establishes a solid foundation for identifying the artist and locating detailed visual representations of the painting's fruit arrangements as specified in the PLAN.",

    "description": "This implementation analyzes the comprehensive search results from the previous phase and conducts specialized image searches to locate visual representations of the fruit arrangements in 'Embroidery from Uzbekistan'. The approach includes: (1) Systematic analysis of the collected search data to extract key information about the artist (Janet Fish), painting details (2008, oil on canvas, 50x70 inches), and museum location (Dayton Art Institute, accession 2009.8), (2) Targeted Google Images searches using refined queries that focus on the artist, artwork title, and fruit composition elements, (3) Quality scoring system for image results that prioritizes museum sources, exact title matches, artist name presence, and fruit content indicators, (4) Comprehensive documentation of all findings including high-quality image sources from the Dayton Art Institute, Pinterest, Instagram, and YouTube. The code successfully completes all PLAN objectives by identifying the artist, verifying the painting's existence, and locating multiple visual sources that should contain detailed representations of the fruit arrangements mentioned in the original task.",
