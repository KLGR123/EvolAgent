Based on the comprehensive verification conducted by the developer in the HISTORY, Whitney Museum accession number 2022.128 definitively refers to Alexander Calder's 1931 pen and ink drawing 'Juggler with Dog' - not a photograph of a person holding a book as described in the task. The developer's exhaustive search across multiple official Whitney Museum sources, structured metadata, and alternative databases consistently confirms this is a circus-themed drawing with no book or readable text present. The original task description contains a factual error about the nature of this artwork. Since there is no photograph of a person holding a book at this accession number, it is impossible to identify any book author or their 1813 military service. Final answer: The task premise is incorrect - accession 2022.128 is a pen and ink drawing, not a photograph with a book.",
