    "description": "Initiating comprehensive search for the NIH translation of the original 1913 Michaelis-Menten paper to locate the final equation. This search targets official NIH sources (nih.gov, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, PubMed) and uses multiple query strategies to find the translated version of Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten's seminal 1913 paper 'Die Kinetik der Invertinwirkung'. The code systematically searches for the NIH English translation, prioritizes official government sources, and analyzes results for equation-specific content. I'm looking for the final mathematical equation as presented in the NIH translated version, which will provide the specific form needed to apply to our extracted Reaction 7 data (Substrate Concentration: 72.3, kcat: 0.0429, Km: 0.052). The search results will be saved for subsequent equation extraction and analysis.",

The script successfully initiated the search for NIH translation of the 1913 Michaelis-Menten paper and executed the first search query, finding 2 results including promising candidates that reference the NIH translation. However, the output was cut off during the second search (query 2/8) which targeted 'site:nih.gov' and found 12 results including highly relevant NIH/NCBI sources like 'Translation of the 1913 Michaelis-Menten Paper - PMC'. The search strategy is sound and was identifying official NIH sources with high relevance scores, but the execution appears to have stopped before completing all 8 targeted searches and the final analysis. **PLAN** alignment: 30% complete - search initiated and promising NIH translation candidates identified, but equation extraction not completed due to incomplete execution.

Based on the search history, the official NIH PMC article 'Translation of the 1913 Michaelis-Menten Paper' (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3381512/) had the highest relevance score (27-32) as an official NIH/NCBI source. I'm directly accessing this authoritative translation to locate the final equation presented in the NIH translated version. The code systematically extracts content, searches for mathematical equations and formulas, analyzes equation-related sentences, and looks for mathematical notation in the HTML structure. This will provide the specific mathematical form of the equation as presented in the NIH translation, which we can then apply to our extracted Reaction 7 data (Substrate Concentration: 72.3, kcat: 0.0429, Km: 0.052) for velocity calculations.",

Sentence 37:\n   As a final, comprehensive test of their model, they analyzed full time course kinetic data based upon the integrated form of the rate equations, including product inhibition\n   🎯 POTENTIAL FINAL EQUATION CANDIDATE\n\n7. Sentence 56:\n   In general, we translated the paper literally, but corrected two minor math errors (sign and subscript), which were not propagated in subsequent equations in the original text\n   🎯 POTENTIAL FINAL EQUATION CANDIDATE\n\n8. Sentence 66:\n   Open in a new tab\nThe data from Michaelis and Menten (reproduced in Table 1) were fit by simulation using KinTek Explorer software (9) with the only variable being kcat*E0 to get the smooth lines; an arbitrary, low enzyme concentration was chosen to perform the simulation\n\n9. Sentence 72:\n   Historical Perspective\nPerhaps the unsung hero of the early history of enzymology is Victor Henri, who first derived an equation predicting the relationship between rate and substrate concentration based upon a rational model involving the formation of catalytic enzyme-substrate complex (2)\n   🎯 POTENTIAL FINAL EQUATION CANDIDATE\n\n10. Sentence 73:\n   However, as Michaelis and Menten point out, Henri made two crucial mistakes, which prevented him from confirming the predicted relationship between rate and substrate concentration\n\n11. Sentence 76:\n   Otherwise, we would probably be writing about the Henri equation\n   🎯 POTENTIAL FINAL EQUATION CANDIDATE\n\n12. Sentence 77:\n   As they are usually credited, Michaelis and Menten measured the initial velocity as a function of sucrose concentration and derived an equation that approximates the modern version of the Michaelis-Menten equation: \n\nν=C·Φ·[S][S]+k\nwhere C · Φ = Vmax, Φ = total enzyme concentration, and k = KS\n   🎯 POTENTIAL FINAL EQUATION CANDIDATE\n\n13. Sentence 78:\n   In this expression, C is kcat multiplied by a factor to convert change in optical rotation to concentration of substrate converted to product\n\n14. Sentence 79:\n   Michaelis and Menten overlooked the obvious double reciprocal plot as a means to obtain a linear extrapolation to infinite substrate concentration\n\n15. Sentence 81:\n   They re-plotted their data as rate versus the log of substrate concentration, in a form analogous to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for pH dependence, to be published four years later (3)\n   🎯 POTENTIAL FINAL EQUATION CANDIDATE\n\n============================================================\nSEARCHING FOR MATHEMATICAL NOTATION IN HTML\n============================================================\nFound 34 mathematical elements in HTML\n\n1.
