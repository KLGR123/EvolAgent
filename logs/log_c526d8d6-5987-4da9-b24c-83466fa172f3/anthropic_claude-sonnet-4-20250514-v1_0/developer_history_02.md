This code performs comprehensive analysis including: (1) Loading the workbook with openpyxl to examine raw structure and cell contents, (2) Searching for 'Reaction 7' references and Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters like Km, Vmax, substrate concentration, enzyme concentration throughout all worksheets, (3) Using pandas for additional DataFrame analysis and pattern matching, (4) Identifying column headers and data organization to understand how kinetic data is structured. The verbose output will help identify where Reaction 7 data is located and what kinetic parameters are available for Michaelis-Menten equation application.

The code properly parsed the Excel file structure, identified the relevant columns, and extracted the specific data needed to apply the Michaelis-Menten equation. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all kinetic parameters for Reaction 7 have been successfully identified and extracted.

This code: (1) Executes targeted searches using SerpAPI focusing on NIH/NCBI domains and translation-specific terms, (2) Analyzes search results with relevance scoring prioritizing official NIH sources, government domains, and content mentioning equations/translations, (3) Loads the previously extracted Reaction 7 data ([S]=72.3, kcat=0.0429, Km=0.052), (4) Applies the standard Michaelis-Menten equation v = (kcat * [S]) / (Km + [S]) to calculate velocity, (5) Computes the final answer to four decimal places as requested. The calculation yields the reaction velocity while simultaneously searching for the NIH translation to verify the exact equation format.

Next step: Access the PMC article content to extract the exact final equation format used in the NIH translation, then verify the calculation matches that specific format.
