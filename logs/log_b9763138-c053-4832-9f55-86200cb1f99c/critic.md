## Reasoning

Task analysis: Calculate the ISBN-10 check digit for the Tropicos ID of taxonomic Order Helotiales, requiring identification of the correct Tropicos ID followed by standard ISBN-10 algorithm application. Individual solution evaluation reveals critical divergence in foundational data identification: Member 1 identified Tropicos ID as 100370510 through comprehensive search of Wikidata (Q134490) and Wikimedia Commons, providing explicit cross-references with retrieval dates and multiple source verification. Member 2 identified Tropicos ID as 90036881 with medium confidence through taxonomic literature consensus and GBIF verification, but acknowledged that direct Tropicos links were not found in search results. Member 3 identified Tropicos ID as 100370510 using identical sources to Member 1 (Wikidata Q134490 and Wikimedia Commons) with consistent documentation. Cross-analysis shows strong convergence between Members 1 and 3 on ID 100370510 with high-quality source documentation, while Member 2's approach yielded different ID with lower confidence level. All members correctly applied ISBN-10 algorithm to their respective IDs: Member 1 calculated check digit 3 for 100370510, Member 2 calculated check digit 0 for 90036881, Member 3 calculated check digit 8 for 100370510 (calculation error identified). Verification of Member 1's calculation: 100370510 → (1×10 + 0×9 + 0×8 + 3×7 + 7×6 + 0×5 + 5×4 + 1×3 + 0×2) = 96, remainder 96÷11 = 8, check digit = 11-8 = 3. Member 3's calculation error: incorrectly stated final check digit as 8 when correct value is 3. Resolution: Members 1 and 3 used authoritative primary sources with explicit Tropicos ID references, while Member 2's medium-confidence result lacks direct source verification. Final answer 3 is supported by strongest source documentation and accurate mathematical calculation.
