  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine whether Earl Smith can traverse all his green-coded land plots exactly once and return to his starting plot without backtracking - a classic Hamiltonian cycle problem requiring Excel data parsing and graph theory analysis. Member 0 (Index 0) provided comprehensive systematic approach: successfully parsed the Excel file to identify 49 green plots, constructed proper adjacency graph with detailed validation, applied rigorous mathematical proof showing nodes with degree 1 make Hamiltonian cycles impossible, and documented complete analysis with verification files. Member 1 (Index 1) demonstrated solid technical execution: correctly parsed data, built adjacency list, implemented backtracking algorithm for Hamiltonian cycle detection, reached correct conclusion with proper algorithmic verification, though with less detailed mathematical explanation than Member 0. Member 2 (Index 2) achieved identical technical results: parsed Excel data accurately, constructed proper graph representation, applied backtracking algorithm successfully, provided comprehensive timing analysis (0.050 seconds), and documented complete graph properties with clear practical implications. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence on core findings: all members identified 49 green plots, confirmed graph connectivity, and determined no Hamiltonian cycle exists. Methodological comparison shows Member 0 provided strongest theoretical foundation with mathematical proof (degree analysis), while Members 1 and 2 relied on algorithmic verification. Integration assessment: Member 0's approach combines optimal mathematical rigor with comprehensive documentation, providing both theoretical proof and practical verification. Final validation confirms 'No' answer is mathematically sound and algorithmically verified across multiple independent approaches.",
