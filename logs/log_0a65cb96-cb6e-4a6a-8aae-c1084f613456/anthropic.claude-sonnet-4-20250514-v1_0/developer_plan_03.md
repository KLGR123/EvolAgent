## Plan Content
```
Verify that the architectural firm Holabird & Roche was still operating under that name as of June 2023, and confirm the first name that appears in the firm's name. Search for current information about the firm's status, any name changes, mergers, or succession firms that might have occurred between 1894 and June 2023. Focus on determining whether 'Holabird' remains the first name in the firm's official designation as of the specified date.
```

## Plan Description
```
This verification step is necessary because: (1) We have identified the Marquette Building and its original 1894 architectural firm Holabird & Roche, (2) The task specifically asks for the firm name 'as of June 2023', which requires confirming the firm's current status over 125 years later, (3) Expected outcome is to verify whether the firm still exists under the same name or has evolved, and confirm 'Holabird' as the first name, (4) This ensures accuracy for the final answer regarding the firm's name as of the specified 2023 date

The search results show mixed references to both 'Holabird & Roche' (historical) and 'Holabird & Root' (current), but don't clearly establish the exact timeline of the name change or confirm the firm's official designation as of June 2023. **PLAN** alignment: 60% complete.

    "description": "Analyzing the search results from the initial query to understand the structure and extract key findings about Holabird firm's current status. The previous search indicated that the firm might currently operate as 'Holabird & Root' rather than 'Holabird & Roche', and appears to be currently operating. I'm examining the JSON structure first to understand the data format, then systematically analyzing the results to identify: (1) Current firm name variations, (2) Operating status confirmations, (3) 2023-specific references, and (4) Any evidence of name changes. This analysis will help determine if we need additional targeted searches or if we have enough information to answer the PLAN's questions about the firm's June 2023 status and whether 'Holabird' remains the first name.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and performed thorough analysis of the search results data. The analysis successfully parsed the JSON structure, identified 8 key findings including current firm names and 2023 references, and conducted critical analysis showing 5 mentions of 'Holabird & Root' vs 9 mentions of 'Holabird & Roche'. Most importantly, the code confirmed that the firm currently operates and found multiple sources stating it 'remains a privately held partnership currently operating.' The analysis clearly established that: (1) The firm currently operates as 'Holabird & Root' rather than 'Holabird & Roche', (2) The first name 'Holabird' is confirmed to remain in the current firm name, and (3) The firm is actively operating as of 2023. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - the core questions are answered but June 2023 specific confirmation would strengthen the findings. The detailed analysis output contains valuable findings that should be saved for documentation. Recommendation: Save the comprehensive analysis results to 'workspace/holabird_firm_analysis_summary.txt' to preserve the key findings and conclusions for future reference.",

Based on the initial search analysis, I discovered that the firm currently operates as 'Holabird & Root' rather than 'Holabird & Roche', but need to confirm this with more targeted evidence. This search uses quoted terms to find exact matches and focuses on current operational status. I'm also compiling a comprehensive final analysis that addresses all PLAN requirements: (1) verifying the firm's June 2023 status, (2) confirming any name changes, and (3) establishing that 'Holabird' remains the first name in the firm's current designation. The analysis will be saved to workspace for documentation and to provide a clear answer to the PLAN's questions.",
