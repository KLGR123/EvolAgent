**Task ID:** 0a65cb96-cb6e-4a6a-8aae-c1084f613456  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 23:37:19

## Plan Content
```
Research Jacques Marquette, the namesake of Marquette, Michigan, to identify the landmark building in Chicago named after him. Search for buildings, structures, or institutions in Chicago that bear the Marquette name. Focus on finding the specific landmark building and then identify which architectural firm designed it. Look for historical records, architectural databases, or Chicago building information that connects Jacques Marquette to a notable Chicago structure.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the logical next step because: (1) We have successfully identified Marquette, Michigan as the city showing lights on the horizon in the NASA APOD from August 3, 2015, (2) The city is named after Jacques Marquette, so we need to find the Chicago landmark bearing his name, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific Marquette-named building in Chicago and its architectural firm, (4) This advances us toward the final goal of finding the architectural firm's name and extracting the first name in the firm's title

    "description": 'Starting the research by conducting a comprehensive Google search for Jacques Marquette and buildings named after him in Chicago. This initial search combines multiple relevant keywords (Jacques Marquette, Chicago, building, landmark, architecture, namesake) to cast a wide net and identify potential landmark buildings. The code searches for up to 15 results and processes them to extract building names and architectural firm mentions using regex patterns. It saves all raw results to workspace/marquette_chicago_search_results.json for detailed analysis and provides a summary of relevant findings including building keywords, architect patterns, and potential matches. This approach will help identify the specific landmark building in Chicago named after Jacques Marquette and potentially reveal information about its architectural firm.',

The code found 14 relevant search results with multiple highly relevant matches confirming: (1) The Marquette Building at 56 W.

Based on the search results from the previous execution, I have identified both required pieces of information: (1) The landmark building in Chicago named after Jacques Marquette is the **Marquette Building**, located at 56 W. Adams St. in the Loop district, and (2) The architectural firm that designed it is **Holabird & Roche**. The search results clearly show that the Marquette Building was completed in 1894-1895 and was named in honor of Father Jacques Marquette, the French Jesuit missionary and explorer who was the first European to explore the Chicago region in 1674. Multiple authoritative sources including the Chicago Architecture Foundation, Wikipedia, and architectural documentation confirm that the firm Holabird & Roche (founded by William Holabird and Martin Roche) designed this historic landmark. The building was designated as a Chicago Landmark on June 9, 1975, and is recognized as an important example of 19th century commercial architecture. All search data has been saved to workspace/marquette_chicago_search_results.json for reference.
