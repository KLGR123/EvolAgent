## Plan Content
```
Research the architectural firm Holabird & Roche to determine the first name appearing in the firm's name as of June 2023. Focus on finding: (1) The complete firm name and any variations or successors, (2) The chronological order of names in the firm title, (3) Verify the firm's status and naming convention as of June 2023, (4) Confirm which name appears first alphabetically or positionally in the official firm designation. Look for the firm's current website, professional directories, architectural databases, and recent project listings to establish the exact naming format used in 2023.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary final step because: (1) Previous research identified Holabird & Roche as the architectural firm that designed the Marquette Building, (2) We need to determine the first name in the firm's title specifically as of June 2023 to complete the task, (3) Expected outcome is to confirm whether 'Holabird' appears first in the firm name and verify this was still accurate in June 2023, (4) This directly answers the final question about the first name in the architectural firm's designation

    "description": "Starting comprehensive research on Holabird & Roche architectural firm to determine the first name appearing in the firm's name as of June 2023. This initial phase attempts both direct website access and Google search (if API key available) to gather baseline information about the firm's current status, official website, and naming convention. The code searches for the firm's official website through common URL patterns and uses Google search to find recent references to the firm. All findings are saved to workspace files for further analysis. This establishes the foundation for determining whether the firm exists, what its current name format is, and which name appears first in the official designation.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully gathered comprehensive research data about Holabird & Roche architectural firm. The search results provide crucial information showing that the original firm 'Holabird & Roche' (founded 1883) evolved into 'Holabird & Root' which is the current firm name as of 2023. Key findings: (1) Multiple sources confirm the firm is now called 'Holabird & Root', (2) The firm's current website is holabird.com, (3) Instagram posts from early 2023 explicitly state it's 'Holabird and Root', (4) The firm changed from 'Roche' to 'Root' at some point historically. However, the research has not yet definitively answered the specific question about which first name appears first in the firm name as of June 2023. The data shows 'Holabird' consistently appears first in 'Holabird & Root', so the first name would be 'William' (William Holabird). Recommendation: Save the detailed search results (already done), then analyze the current firm website directly to confirm the exact 2023 naming format and extract the specific first name information required by the PLAN.",

    "description": "Analyzing the comprehensive search results from the previous research phase to determine the exact firm name as of June 2023. The code first inspects the structure of the saved search results JSON file to understand the data format, then systematically analyzes all search results to identify key findings about the firm's current name. Key analysis points include: (1) Identifying the official website (holabird.com), (2) Finding 2023 references that confirm the current name, (3) Understanding the historical transition from 'Holabird & Roche' to 'Holabird & Root', (4) Consolidating evidence from multiple sources including Instagram posts from early 2023. The analysis reveals that the firm is currently known as 'Holabird & Root' as of June 2023, having evolved from the original 'Holabird & Roche' name. This establishes the foundation for the next step: determining which first name appears first in the firm designation.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed a thorough analysis of the research data, successfully determining that as of June 2023, the architectural firm is named 'Holabird & Root' (not 'Holabird & Roche'). The analysis correctly identified the firm's evolution from the historical 'Holabird & Roche' to the current 'Holabird & Root' and found multiple sources confirming this, including the official website (holabird.com) and 2023 Instagram references. The code properly saved analysis results to workspace/holabird_analysis_results.json. However, the PLAN specifically asks for 'the first name appearing in the firm's name' - meaning the personal first name, not the company name position. Since 'Holabird' refers to William Holabird and consistently appears first in 'Holabird & Root', the answer to the PLAN question is 'William'. The research objective is 100% complete with definitive evidence that the firm name as of June 2023 is 'Holabird & Root' where 'Holabird' (William's surname) appears first, making 'William' the first name in the firm designation.",

    "description": "Completing the final analysis to determine the first name appearing in the Holabird & Roche firm name as of June 2023. The code loads the previously saved analysis results and synthesizes all research findings to provide the definitive answer. Key analysis steps: (1) Confirms the firm name as of June 2023 is 'Holabird & Root' (evolved from 'Holabird & Roche'), (2) Identifies that 'Holabird' is the first surname in the firm name, (3) Establishes from historical evidence that 'Holabird' refers to founder William Holabird (1854-1923), (4) Determines that 'William' is therefore the first name appearing in the firm designation. The analysis draws on multiple verified sources including the official website (holabird.com), 2023 Instagram references, government sources (cfa.gov), and Chicago landmarks database. The final answer 'William' is saved with complete documentation of the research process, historical context, and verification steps. This definitively answers the PLAN requirement to identify the first name appearing in the firm's name as of June 2023.",
