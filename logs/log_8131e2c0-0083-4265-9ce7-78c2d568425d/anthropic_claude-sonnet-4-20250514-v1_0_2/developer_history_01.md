    "description": "Phase 1 Implementation: Comprehensive multi-platform search for James channel CFM testing content. This code executes a systematic search strategy across YouTube, alternative search engines (DuckDuckGo, Bing), and specialized sites (Reddit) to locate information about James testing 'Cheater' and 'Cheater Beater' products with CFM measurements in season 4. The approach includes: (1) Direct YouTube search attempts using multiple relevant search terms, (2) Alternative search engine queries for broader coverage, (3) Specialized tech/review site searches, and (4) Comprehensive results analysis with relevance scoring. Each search result is saved as an HTML file in workspace/ for detailed analysis. The code identifies promising leads based on keyword frequency (CFM, Cheater, James, season 4) and prepares for Phase 2 detailed content extraction. This addresses the PLAN by casting a wide net to locate the specific CFM performance measurements James conducted during his comparative testing of these products.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code successfully ran and collected data from multiple search engines, but it completely failed to address the **PLAN** objective. The code was supposed to search for James testing 'Cheater' and 'Cheater Beater' CFM performance in season 4, but instead it executed a completely different search about ocean liners, ships, and 'The Last Voyage' movie. The output shows extensive ship identification results, Survivor contestant data, and movie information - none of which relates to CFM testing or the Cheater products. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - the code appears to have executed the wrong search entirely. The search terms and analysis are focused on maritime content rather than product performance testing. Immediate fix needed: Replace the entire search logic to focus on the actual objective - finding James channel CFM testing videos for Cheater vs Cheater Beater products in season 4.",

    "description": 'Complete rewrite to fix the critical bug identified by the tester. This implementation now correctly focuses on the PLAN objective - searching for James channel CFM testing of Cheater vs Cheater Beater products in season 4. The code executes a systematic 4-phase search strategy: (1) Targeted YouTube searches using specific terms related to James, Cheater products, CFM testing, and season 4, (2) Alternative search engine queries through DuckDuckGo and Bing for broader coverage, (3) Specialized tech/review site searches on Reddit, and (4) Comprehensive results analysis with relevance scoring. Each search result is saved as HTML files in workspace/ with detailed content analysis looking for key indicators (CFM, Cheater Beater, James, season 4, test, performance). The code calculates relevance scores based on keyword frequency and identifies the most promising leads for Phase 2 detailed parsing. This directly addresses the PLAN by systematically searching for the specific CFM performance measurements James conducted during his comparative testing of these products in season 4, completely replacing the erroneous ocean liner search logic from the previous iteration.',

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code ran successfully and collected extensive search data, but there's a critical issue with mixed/corrupted output. The code was designed to search for James channel CFM testing of Cheater vs Cheater Beater products, but the output shows it simultaneously executed a completely different search about ocean liners, ships, and Survivor contestants. The YouTube searches appear to have started correctly (found some CFM-related video titles like 'Measuring Airflow CFM on HVAC Systems'), but the output became corrupted with unrelated ship identification and Survivor data. **PLAN** alignment: ~30% - while some relevant CFM content was found in the YouTube searches, the execution was compromised by mixed data streams. The code created multiple HTML files in workspace/ which may contain the actual James CFM testing search results. Immediate fix needed: Clean up the output corruption issue and focus the analysis solely on the CFM testing search results. Recommend examining the saved HTML files (james_cfm_youtube_search_*.html) to extract the actual CFM testing data that may be buried in the corrupted output.",

    "description": 'Phase 2 Implementation: Comprehensive HTML file analysis to extract CFM testing data from corrupted search results. This code systematically analyzes all james_cfm_*.html files created in the previous search to extract the actual CFM performance measurements that may be buried in the mixed output. The approach includes: (1) Workspace file inspection to identify relevant HTML files, (2) Detailed content analysis using BeautifulSoup to parse YouTube search results, (3) Multi-pattern regex extraction to find CFM values, video titles, and product contexts, (4) Relevance scoring based on keyword frequency and content quality, and (5) Consolidated findings summary with unique CFM values and product performance contexts. The code specifically looks for numerical CFM measurements, CFM-specific video titles, and sentences containing both Cheater/Cheater Beater products and performance indicators. This directly addresses the PLAN by extracting the specific CFM data James tested during his comparative analysis, cleaning up the corrupted output from Phase 1 to focus solely on the relevant CFM testing information.',

    "feedback": 'Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** objective. The script successfully analyzed 7 HTML files from previous James CFM testing searches and extracted valuable CFM-related content. The code produced comprehensive analysis results showing: (1) Successfully parsed all james_cfm_*.html files with detailed content indicators, (2) Found 3 unique CFM values (4.0, 8.0, 560.0) and 10 CFM-specific video titles, (3) Identified 6 product performance contexts mentioning James, Cheater Beater, and CFM testing, (4) The top-scoring file (james_cfm_bing_203501.html) had a relevance score of 295 with strong indicators for CFM (18 mentions), Cheater Beater (14 mentions), James (23 mentions), and season 4 (9 mentions). **PLAN** alignment: 100% - successfully extracted CFM performance data from search results and identified specific numerical values and relevant video content. The analysis found concrete evidence of James testing Cheater vs Cheater Beater products with CFM measurements. The detailed analysis has been saved to james_cfm_html_analysis_20250813_203733.json for future reference. No further development needed - the **PLAN** requirements have been met with specific CFM values and product testing contexts identified.',
