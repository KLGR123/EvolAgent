## Task Description
```
Where did the person—who served as U.S. Attorney General under Donald Trump, voted in favor of the bill with number H.R. 9 (109th Congress) reauthorized in 2006 and passed by a 98-0 Senate vote, and spoke in favor of the measure originally authorized in 2002 and repealed by the U.S. Senate in 2023 (whose House legislative status remains unresolved, was co-sponsored by Christopher Cox, aims to support regime change through opposition groups, and targets a certain leader)—deliver a speech in 2005?

### Nationality of the Postmaster General who introduced scheduled turnpike mail service

**TASK**: What is the name of the nationality of the person who served as Postmaster General and introduced a postal system that first implemented scheduled delivery times and operated on turnpike roads?

```

    "plan": "Research the history of postal systems to identify the person who served as Postmaster General and introduced a postal system that first implemented scheduled delivery times and operated on turnpike roads. Focus on early postal system developments, particularly in countries known for pioneering organized mail delivery systems such as Britain, France, or early American postal services. Search for keywords including 'first scheduled postal delivery', 'turnpike road postal system', 'Postmaster General scheduled delivery times', and 'early postal system turnpike roads'.",

The comprehensive research has definitively identified John Palmer as the person who introduced the first scheduled postal delivery system operating on turnpike roads in Britain on August 2, 1784. The research thoroughly addresses all PLAN requirements: (1) Researched the history of postal systems with focus on early developments in Britain, France, and America, (2) Identified the key figure - John Palmer - who worked with postal authorities to implement this revolutionary system, (3) Documented the implementation of scheduled delivery times with precise, published timetables that were revolutionary for the time, (4) Confirmed the specific use of turnpike road infrastructure for reliability and speed, (5) Covered all requested search keywords including 'first scheduled postal delivery', 'turnpike road postal system', 'Postmaster General scheduled delivery times', and 'early postal system turnpike roads'. The research data is comprehensively saved in workspace/postal_history_research.json with detailed analysis of key historical figures (Palmer, Franklin, Allen), turnpike roads context, and complete evidence supporting Palmer as the innovator who reduced London-Bath delivery time from 38 to 16 hours through systematic scheduling. While Palmer wasn't technically titled 'Postmaster General', he was the definitive figure who introduced scheduled delivery on turnpike roads, working with postal authorities to create the foundation for modern postal scheduling systems worldwide.
