# Developer Plan #1 - claude-3-7-sonnet-v1

**Task ID:** 3627a8be-a77f-41bb-b807-7e1bd4c0ebdf  
**Model:** claude-3-7-sonnet-v1  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-31 11:26:47

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about the British Museum object with museum number 2012,5015.17 to identify the specific mollusk species. Focus on finding the official British Museum collection entry, which should provide the taxonomic identification of this shell specimen.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify which mollusk species the shell belongs to before we can find research about beads made from this species, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to determine the exact mollusk species associated with museum number 2012,5015.17, (4) This provides the essential information needed to then search for the 2021 Science Advances article about beads made from this species

Direct search on the British Museum website by constructing a URL with the museum number and parsing the HTML response to extract object details, focusing on taxonomic information.\n\n2. Google search using SerpAPI (if available) with multiple queries related to the museum object, analyzing the search results for relevant information about the specimen, and following promising links to extract potential scientific names.\n\n3. Attempt to access a British Museum API endpoint that might provide structured data about the object.\n\nThe code includes comprehensive error handling and saves all responses to the workspace directory for further analysis. It looks for taxonomic information using pattern matching for scientific names (Genus species format) and searches for relevant terms like 'mollusk', 'species', 'shell', etc. The implementation provides detailed progress reporting through print statements to help understand what information was found and where.\n\nThe search results and HTML responses are saved to:\n- workspace/british_museum_response.html\n- workspace/british_museum_search_results.json\n- workspace/british_museum_api_response.json\n\nThis approach should help identify the mollusk species associated with the British Museum object 2012,5015.17 by gathering information from multiple sources.",

The code performs the following tasks:\n\n1. Loads and examines the structure of the search results JSON file from the previous execution\n2. Extracts all snippets that specifically mention our museum object number\n3. Applies multiple regex patterns to identify species names in the snippets, including:\n   - Quoted species names like \'Nassa gibbosula\'\n   - Scientific name format (Genus species)\n   - Names following phrases like "scientific name:" or "species:"\n4. Counts occurrences of each species candidate to determine the most likely identification\n5. Confirms whether the identified species matches the expected \'Nassa gibbosula\' mentioned in the tester feedback\n6. Saves the species identification results to a new JSON file for reference\n\nThe code includes robust error handling and fallback mechanisms to locate alternative JSON files if the expected file isn\'t found. It also provides detailed progress reporting through print statements to clearly show the analysis process and findings.\n\nBased on the search results, the code confirms that British Museum object 2012,5015.17 is a shell of the marine gastropod mollusc species \'Nassa gibbosula\' from the Mediterranean, which matches the information found in the previous search results.',
