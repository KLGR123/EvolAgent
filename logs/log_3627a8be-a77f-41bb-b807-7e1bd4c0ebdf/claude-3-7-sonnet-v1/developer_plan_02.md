## Plan Content
```
Search for research articles published in Science Advances in 2021 that discuss beads made from Nassa gibbosula shells. Focus on finding the specific article with an abstract mentioning the age of these beads in thousands of years.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal next step because: (1) We've already identified from the HISTORY that British Museum object 2012,5015.17 is a shell of the Nassa gibbosula species, (2) We now need to find the 2021 Science Advances article that discusses beads made from this species, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the specific article and extract the age information from its abstract, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement to determine how many thousands of years old these beads are according to the abstract
