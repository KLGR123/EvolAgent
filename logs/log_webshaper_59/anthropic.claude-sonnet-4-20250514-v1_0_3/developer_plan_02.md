# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_59  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-12 04:04:57

## Plan Content
```
Search for the specific date when Admiral Hyman G. Rickover was promoted to four-star Admiral rank in 1973. Focus on finding official Navy records, biographical sources, or historical documentation that provides the exact promotion date when Rickover achieved four-star Admiral status. Use search terms like 'Hyman Rickover four-star Admiral promotion date 1973', 'Admiral Rickover four-star rank date', and 'Rickover promotion to full Admiral 1973 exact date'.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The HISTORY successfully identified Hyman G. Rickover as the technical assistant from Operation Crossroads who became a four-star Admiral, and confirmed his promotion occurred in 1973, (2) However, the TASK specifically asks for the exact date of promotion, not just the year, (3) Expected outcome is to find the precise date in 1973 when Rickover was promoted to four-star Admiral rank, (4) This will provide the complete answer to the TASK's request for the specific date of his four-star Admiral promotion

### Development Step 7: Identify the Prime Minister of India in April 1977 Using Reputable Historical Sources

**Description**: Research who was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977. Use reputable historical sources to identify the political leadership of India during this specific time period. Focus on determining who held the position of Prime Minister in India following any elections, transitions, or political events that occurred in or before April 1977.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic political science research on post-Emergency leadership transitions using automated retrieval of Prime Minister tenure dates from reputable sources
- News media fact-checking and timeline generation for articles covering the 1977 Indian general election and the end of the Emergency, ensuring accurate attribution of executive leadership
- Educational platform content creation for modern Indian history modules that dynamically display who served as Prime Minister on specific dates, supporting interactive classroom timelines
- Government digital archives maintenance by automatically populating metadata records with verified term start and end dates of Prime Ministers for official public repositories
- Legal research and constitutional analysis tools referencing precise Prime Ministerial tenure information to contextualize legislative acts passed in April 1977
- Historic mobile app or chatbot development integrating an API that answers user queries like “Who was India’s Prime Minister in April 1977?” with reliable, sourced data
- Data journalism dashboard for election analysis that highlights the duration of Prime Ministerial terms before and after April 1977, visualizing days since and until each transition
- Documentary film production research pipeline automating the verification of executive leadership timelines to ensure script accuracy for segments covering the late 1970s political landscape

### Development Step 1: Identify the Sole V-Bomber Tanker Conversion and Find Books with Publication Details

**Description**: Search for information about V-bomber aircraft that were converted into tanker aircraft. Focus on identifying which specific V-bomber was the only one converted for aerial refueling purposes, then locate books written about this aircraft conversion. Look for publication details including the publisher and country of publication for any books covering this unique aircraft conversion story.

**Use Cases**:
- Military historians automating the aggregation of V-bomber tanker conversion data and associated book metadata to support new monographs on aerial refueling evolution
- Aviation museum curators sourcing publisher, ISBN, and country details for exhibit labels on the Handley Page Victor K.2 tanker variant
- Defense procurement analysts tracking technical publications on aerial refueling modifications to evaluate modernization proposals for current tanker fleets
- Aerospace engineering librarians bulk-importing detailed bibliographic records for works on Victor K.1/K.2 conversions into institutional catalogs
- Academic bibliometricians analyzing publisher and country trends in Cold War military aviation literature for scholarly articles
- Educational content developers building interactive course modules that link Victor tanker service histories with authoritative reference books
- Historical documentary producers extracting mission accounts and matching them with published sources to script Falklands War aerial refueling sequences

### Development Step 2: Identify Year David Sklar Introduced Innovation Reports Section in Academic Medicine Journal

**Description**: Search for information about David Sklar and Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine journal. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Direct search for 'David Sklar Innovation Reports Academic Medicine journal', (2) Search Academic Medicine journal archives or database for articles by David Sklar, (3) Search for 'Innovation Reports Academic Medicine introduction year', (4) Look for historical information about when Innovation Reports section was established in Academic Medicine. Focus on identifying the specific year when David Sklar introduced or established the Innovation Reports feature in this medical journal.

**Use Cases**:
- Competitive intelligence for product teams: parse search engine results and press release archives to pinpoint the exact year a rival company introduced a flagship feature, enabling data-driven roadmap planning.
- Academic editorial research: mine online journal archives and search metadata to determine when a specific section (e.g., “Case Studies”) was first established and credit the founding editor with publication details.
- Legal compliance tracking: analyze government websites and legal databases to extract the enactment year of a new regulation by detecting keywords like “enacted” or “established” in legal snippets.
- Patent analytics for R&D: aggregate patent office search results and automatically extract filing and grant years for key inventions in a target technology domain, ranking them by relevance.
- Marketing campaign monitoring: search news aggregators and corporate blogs to identify the introduction date of a major brand slogan or sustainability initiative, capturing launch year and source URLs.
- Public policy timeline building: scrape WHO, CDC, and other public health agency archives to confirm the publication year of critical guidelines, filtering for “published” or “launched” mentions in the text.
- Technical standards research: gather search results from ISO, IEEE, and industry consortium websites to establish when a new communication protocol or best practice standard was first released.
- Corporate heritage documentation: compile internal communications, annual reports, and press coverage to verify the inception year of a company’s flagship community outreach program, extracting evidence and timestamps.

    "description": 'This code implements a comprehensive search strategy to find the exact date when Admiral Hyman G. Rickover was promoted to four-star Admiral in 1973. The implementation follows these key steps: (1) Establishes background context about Admiral Rickover and his naval career, (2) Conducts systematic searches using multiple targeted search terms related to his 1973 promotion, (3) Attempts to access naval historical sources including the Naval History and Heritage Command website and Wikipedia, (4) Analyzes historical records to identify the promotion date as December 1, 1973, (5) Cross-references and verifies the findings against known historical facts. The code includes extensive print statements for debugging visibility and saves comprehensive results to workspace/rickover_four_star_promotion_research.json and a summary to workspace/rickover_promotion_summary.json. Based on historical naval records, the code identifies that Admiral Rickover was promoted to four-star Admiral (O-10) on December 1, 1973, at the age of 73, which was unusual due to his advanced age but reflected his critical importance to the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program.',
