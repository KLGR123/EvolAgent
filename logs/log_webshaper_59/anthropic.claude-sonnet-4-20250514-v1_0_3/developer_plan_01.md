# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_59  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-12 04:03:23

## Plan Content
```
Research the 1946 nuclear test series to identify which series had a canceled test named 'Test Charlie', then find information about Commander Joint Task Force One and their technical assistant staff members who participated in that specific test series. Focus on identifying the individual who served as technical assistant and later became a four-star Admiral, then determine the exact date of their promotion to four-star rank.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific 1946 nuclear test series that had a canceled 'Test Charlie' test, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the nuclear test series (likely Operation Crossroads) and identify Commander Joint Task Force One's technical assistant who later achieved four-star Admiral rank, (4) This systematic approach will help us trace the career progression from 1946 technical assistant role to four-star Admiral promotion date

### Development Step 1: Identify the Sole V-Bomber Tanker Conversion and Find Books with Publication Details

**Description**: Search for information about V-bomber aircraft that were converted into tanker aircraft. Focus on identifying which specific V-bomber was the only one converted for aerial refueling purposes, then locate books written about this aircraft conversion. Look for publication details including the publisher and country of publication for any books covering this unique aircraft conversion story.

**Use Cases**:
- Military historians automating the aggregation of V-bomber tanker conversion data and associated book metadata to support new monographs on aerial refueling evolution
- Aviation museum curators sourcing publisher, ISBN, and country details for exhibit labels on the Handley Page Victor K.2 tanker variant
- Defense procurement analysts tracking technical publications on aerial refueling modifications to evaluate modernization proposals for current tanker fleets
- Aerospace engineering librarians bulk-importing detailed bibliographic records for works on Victor K.1/K.2 conversions into institutional catalogs
- Academic bibliometricians analyzing publisher and country trends in Cold War military aviation literature for scholarly articles
- Educational content developers building interactive course modules that link Victor tanker service histories with authoritative reference books
- Historical documentary producers extracting mission accounts and matching them with published sources to script Falklands War aerial refueling sequences

### Development Step 6: Search Thorsten Schuette’s July 1965 Activities: Identify Event and Host City

**Description**: Search for information about director Thorsten Schuette's activities in July 1965, focusing on identifying what event he participated in and the city where it took place. Use search approaches including: (1) 'Thorsten Schuette July 1965 event', (2) 'Thorsten Schuette director biography 1965', (3) 'Thorsten Schuette filmmaker early career July 1965', and (4) Cross-reference with film festivals, cultural events, or significant happenings from July 1965 that might have involved this documentary director. Extract details about the specific event and its location to identify the city name.

**Use Cases**:
- Investigative journalism fact-checking a biomedical researcher’s claimed keynote at a 1998 conference in Boston by automating targeted search queries to find event details and venue
- Compliance team in a financial firm verifying a hedge fund manager’s participation in a 2012 risk-management seminar in London via programmatic web searches and snippet analysis
- Academic historian reconstructing a linguist’s early career by identifying the 1973 symposium in Paris where they first presented a paper, using multi-query search cross-referencing
- Museum curator researching an avant-garde artist’s attendance at the 1968 Venice Biennale to confirm exhibition dates and gallery locations through an API-driven search strategy
- Film festival programmer confirming a director’s previous screening at the 1985 Cannes festival by automating searches for archival listings and press releases
- PR agency validating a CEO’s past keynote at a 2019 technology summit in San Francisco to ensure accuracy in promotional materials
- Genealogist mapping an ancestor’s 1946 return voyage to Frankfurt by locating passenger lists and contemporaneous news mentions with targeted search queries
- Intellectual property legal team verifying an inventor’s attendance at a 2005 patent-workshop in Munich for infringement dispute resolution using structured online searches and snippet analysis

### Development Step 26: Arthur Morris’s Pre-1973–74 300+ Test Innings and the Australian Captain

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Fact-checking investigative journalism claims by analyzing archived online news articles to verify if a public figure delivered speeches exceeding three hours, identifying the event date and moderator.
- Pharmaceutical outcome validation by mining clinical trial repositories to confirm whether any Phase III studies reported drug efficacy above 90% in sample sizes over 1,000 before 2010, and identifying the lead clinical research scientist.
- Corporate financial compliance audit by scanning a company’s SEC filings (10-K/8-K) for mentions of restated net income exceeding $50 million, extracting the fiscal year and CFO responsible at the time.
- Legal e-discovery and contract review by processing a repository of corporate agreements to locate termination clauses requiring notice periods longer than six months, isolating clause text and listing contract managers for each contract.
- Academic systematic review for meta-analysis by aggregating published journal abstracts to find studies reporting statistically significant results (p < 0.001) in cohorts over 1,000 subjects published before 2015, summarizing primary authors and journal names.
- Consumer electronics quality assurance by analyzing internal test reports to identify device models that failed more than five consecutive drop tests, cataloging failure reasons and the responsible test engineer.
- Environmental sustainability benchmarking by scanning corporate CSR reports to extract instances where organizations pledged carbon emission reductions above 30% by 2025, and identifying the sustainability officer for follow-up.
- Cultural heritage archiving by searching museum and gallery exhibition records to confirm if an artist’s solo retrospectives attracted over 10,000 visitors before the year 2000, noting exhibition dates and curators.

    "description": "This implementation conducts comprehensive research on the 1946 nuclear test series to identify Operation Crossroads as the series with the canceled 'Test Charlie'. The code systematically analyzes: (1) The test series identification - Operation Crossroads at Bikini Atoll with successful Tests Able and Baker, plus canceled Test Charlie, (2) Command structure analysis - Vice Admiral William H. P. Blandy as Commander Joint Task Force One, (3) Technical staff identification - focusing on personnel who later achieved four-star rank, (4) Admiral Hyman G. Rickover identification as the technical assistant/consultant who became a four-star Admiral, and (5) Promotion date determination - 1973 as Rickover's four-star promotion year. The research creates detailed JSON data files, summary reports, and comprehensive text documentation in the workspace directory. The code provides extensive print statements showing the research methodology, findings verification, and complete timeline analysis. Key finding: Admiral Hyman G. Rickover served as technical consultant during Operation Crossroads (1946) and was promoted to four-star Admiral in 1973.",
