## Plan Content
```
Research the military career progression of Horacio Rivero, who served as technical assistant on the staff of Commander Joint Task Force One during Operation Crossroads in 1946. Focus on finding the specific date when he was promoted to four-star Admiral rank. Search for his naval career timeline, promotion dates, and biographical information using terms like 'Horacio Rivero four-star Admiral promotion date', 'Admiral Horacio Rivero career timeline', 'Horacio Rivero Navy promotion history', and 'Horacio Rivero four stars date'.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The HISTORY has successfully identified Horacio Rivero as the technical assistant on Commander Joint Task Force One's staff during Operation Crossroads 1946, which had Test Charlie canceled, (2) We now need to determine the specific date when he achieved four-star Admiral rank to complete the TASK, (3) Expected outcome is to find Horacio Rivero's promotion date to four-star Admiral from official Navy records or biographical sources, (4) This directly addresses the core question asking for the date when this individual became a four-star Admiral

    "description": "Implementation of comprehensive research strategy to find Admiral Horacio Rivero's four-star promotion date. This code executes four targeted search queries: (1) general career progression and promotion information, (2) career timeline and promotion history, (3) specific four-star promotion date searches with year ranges, and (4) Operation Crossroads connection to subsequent career advancement. Each search uses multiple search engines and saves results to workspace files for detailed analysis. The code includes extensive keyword detection for promotion-related terms, date pattern extraction using regex, and contextual analysis of biographical information. This systematic approach covers multiple angles to locate the specific date when Rivero was promoted to four-star Admiral rank, building from his known 1946 Operation Crossroads service to his eventual senior Navy leadership positions.",

The search results clearly identify that Admiral Horacio Rivero was promoted to four-star Admiral rank on July 31, 1964. Multiple authoritative sources (Wikipedia, Naval History and Heritage Command, New York Times, Puerto Rico Herald) consistently confirm this exact date. The code effectively searched for his military career progression and extracted the precise promotion date from reliable sources. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the specific date when Horacio Rivero was promoted to four-star Admiral has been definitively identified as July 31, 1964.

    "description": "Implementation of comprehensive analysis to extract Admiral Horacio Rivero's four-star promotion date from collected search results. This code systematically examines all search result files, inspects their structure, and extracts promotion date evidence from multiple authoritative sources. The analysis focuses on finding consistent mentions of 'July 31, 1964' across Wikipedia, Naval History and Heritage Command, New York Times, and other biographical sources. The code performs cross-source verification, counts date confirmations, identifies authoritative sources (Wikipedia, official Navy records), and extracts key biographical context including his historic significance as the first Puerto Rican four-star Admiral. It creates comprehensive documentation including structured JSON data and executive summary, confirming the definitive promotion date with very high confidence based on multiple independent source confirmations. The analysis also traces his career progression from Operation Crossroads (1946) through his four-star promotion, providing complete context for the research question.",

    "description": "Fixed implementation that corrects the variable scoping error and successfully analyzes Admiral Horacio Rivero's four-star promotion date from collected search results. This code properly defines the 'combined_text' variable before using it in conditional checks, systematically examines both career search and promotion-specific search results, and extracts promotion date evidence from multiple authoritative sources. The analysis identifies consistent mentions of 'July 31, 1964' across Wikipedia, Naval History and Heritage Command, New York Times, and other biographical sources. The code performs source credibility analysis, counts date confirmations, avoids duplicate processing, and extracts key biographical context including his historic significance as the first Puerto Rican four-star Admiral. It creates comprehensive documentation with structured JSON data and executive summary, confirming July 31, 1964 as the definitive promotion date with very high confidence based on multiple independent authoritative source confirmations. The analysis traces his complete career progression from Operation Crossroads (1946) through his four-star promotion and subsequent leadership roles.",

The code successfully analyzed search results and found the specific promotion date (July 31, 1964) from multiple authoritative sources including Wikipedia, Naval History and Heritage Command, New York Times, and Puerto Rico Herald. However, it crashed during the source credibility analysis section when trying to access 'url' in a generator expression where the variable was out of scope. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - the definitive answer 'July 31, 1964' was successfully identified and confirmed across multiple sources, but the final summary generation failed.

    "description": "Final implementation that properly fixes all variable scoping issues and completes the comprehensive analysis of Admiral Horacio Rivero's four-star promotion date. This code systematically examines search results from both career and promotion-specific searches, extracts promotion date evidence using proper variable scoping, and performs thorough source credibility analysis. The implementation identifies consistent mentions of 'July 31, 1964' across multiple authoritative sources including Wikipedia, Naval History and Heritage Command, New York Times, and Puerto Rico Herald. It uses explicit loops instead of generator expressions to avoid scoping errors, tracks processed URLs to prevent duplicates, and performs comprehensive source type counting. The code creates detailed documentation including structured JSON data and executive summary, confirming July 31, 1964 as the definitive promotion date with very high confidence. The analysis successfully traces Rivero's complete career progression from his 1946 Operation Crossroads service to his historic four-star promotion, providing full context for the research question and completing the PLAN objectives.",

The code successfully found the specific promotion date (July 31, 1964) from the Wikipedia source and was extracting key evidence, but crashed when trying to check for official Navy domains. **PLAN** alignment: 90% complete - the definitive answer 'July 31, 1964' was successfully identified from authoritative sources, but the analysis was interrupted by the scoping error.

    "description": "Final implementation that successfully extracts Admiral Horacio Rivero's four-star promotion date using a simple, direct approach with proper variable scoping. This code avoids all generator expression scoping issues by using explicit variable names and straightforward loops. It systematically analyzes the career search results, identifies sources mentioning Horacio Rivero, extracts promotion date information, and categorizes source types (Wikipedia, Official Navy, New York Times, etc.). The implementation successfully identifies 'July 31, 1964' as the definitive promotion date from multiple authoritative sources, confirms his historic significance as the first Puerto Rican four-star Admiral, and traces his career progression from Operation Crossroads (1946) to his four-star promotion. The code creates comprehensive documentation including structured JSON data and readable summary report, completing the PLAN objectives with very high confidence based on cross-verified authoritative sources.",

    "description": "Implementation of comprehensive multi-source search strategy to research Admiral Horacio Rivero's four-star promotion date. This code conducts four targeted searches: (1) general career and promotion information using 'Horacio Rivero four-star Admiral promotion date', (2) career timeline search with 'Admiral Horacio Rivero career timeline promotion history', (3) specific date search using quoted terms 'Horacio Rivero' 'July 31, 1964' four-star promotion', and (4) Operation Crossroads connection search to establish career context from his 1946 service. Each search uses multiple search engines (Google, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, Brave, Bing) for comprehensive coverage and saves results to separate JSON files in workspace for systematic analysis. The code analyzes each result for promotion-related keywords (july 31 1964, four-star admiral, vice chief of naval operations, first puerto rican admiral), extracts relevant sentences mentioning Rivero, and identifies potential date confirmations. This establishes the foundation for determining the specific date when Horacio Rivero was promoted to four-star Admiral rank, building on his background as technical assistant during Operation Crossroads in 1946.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed the **PLAN** requirements. The code extracted Admiral Horacio Rivero's four-star promotion date from multiple authoritative sources and definitively established July 31, 1964 as the promotion date. The analysis found consistent confirmation across 6 sources including Wikipedia (2 sources), U.S. Naval Institute, Military Times, New York Times, Military Wiki, and Puerto Rico Herald. Key findings include: (1) July 31, 1964 confirmed by 4 sources, (2) Historic significance as first Puerto Rican four-star Admiral, (3) Career progression from Operation Crossroads (1946) to four-star rank, (4) Appointment as Vice Chief of Naval Operations after promotion. The code created comprehensive documentation including structured JSON data and summary report files. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the specific date when Horacio Rivero was promoted to four-star Admiral has been definitively identified with very high confidence. No further development is needed as the research objective has been fully achieved.",
