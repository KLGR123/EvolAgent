# Developer Plan #3 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 6f37996b-2ac7-44b0-8e68-6d28256631b4  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 3  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 01:01:09

## Plan Content
```
Parse workspace/operation_table.csv to identify every pair (x,y) where the entry at row x and column y differs from the entry at row y and column x, collect all unique elements x and y from those non-commutative pairs, and output the result as a comma-separated list of elements in alphabetical order.
```

## Plan Description
```
This plan is optimal because the operation table CSV now exists in workspace/operation_table.csv; the next immediate step is to systematically check commutativity by comparing each entry with its transpose, extract the elements involved in any counter-example, and format the final subset as required, directly advancing toward completion of the TASK.

    "feedback": "Execution successful - the script located and read 'workspace/operation_table.csv' and correctly printed the header and first five data rows. However, it did not implement the core **PLAN** requirements: it only inspected the file and did not identify non-commutative pairs or output any results. **PLAN** alignment: ~10% (file load/inspection only). Main issue: missing logic to compare entry at row x, column y vs. row y, column x, collect all unique elements involved in mismatches, sort them, and print as a comma-separated list. Next steps: \n1. Parse the full table into a data structure (e.g., a dict of dicts or a 2D list with associated labels). \n2. Extract the list of elements from the header and use it for both row and column indices. \n3. Loop over all unordered pairs (x,y) where x != y, compare table[x][y] to table[y][x]. \n4. If they differ, add x and y to a result set. \n5. After checking all pairs, sort the set alphabetically and print or write the comma-separated list. \nOptionally, save the final output to a file like 'workspace/non_commutative_elements.txt' for future reference.",

Printed the constructed table for verification.\n5. Iterated over all ordered pairs (x, y) with x != y, compared table[x][y] to table[y][x], and logged each comparison, marking differences.\n6. Collected all unique elements involved in non-commutative pairs into a set.\n7. Sorted this set alphabetically and joined with commas to form the final output string.\n8. Printed the sorted list and the comma-separated result.\n9. Saved the result string to `workspace/non_commutative_elements.txt` for downstream use.\n\nThis fully implements the PLAN by identifying every non-commutative pair, extracting the involved elements, sorting them, and outputting the result as required.',
