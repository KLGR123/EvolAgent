## Final Answer
```
b,c
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Given an operation table for binary operation * on set S = {a, b, c, d, e}, identify the subset of elements involved in counter-examples that prove the operation is not commutative. This requires systematic comparison of x * y with y * x for all pairs and collecting elements where commutativity fails. Member 0 evaluation: Used systematic approach but made a critical error - claimed all elements (a, b, c, d, e) participate in non-commutative operations without providing specific counter-examples. Their analysis lacks precision and appears to have worked with incorrect data or methodology. Member 1 evaluation: Initially struggled with file location issues but eventually created the operation table correctly. However, their final answer of 'b, e' contains an error - they incorrectly identified element 'e' as participating in non-commutative operations when it does not. Member 2 evaluation: Demonstrated exemplary systematic analysis with complete verification. Methodically checked all 25 possible pairs, correctly identified exactly 2 counter-examples: b * c = d ≠ e = c * b, and documented their findings comprehensively. Their answer of 'b, c' is precise and accurate. Cross-analysis reveals significant divergence: Member 0 claims all elements, Member 1 claims b and e, Member 2 claims b and c. Verification through independent table analysis confirms Member 2's findings: examining the given table shows b * c = d (row b, column c) while c * b = e (row c, column b), proving d ≠ e. All other pairs satisfy commutativity. Integration assessment: Member 2's methodology is most reliable with proper verification steps and accurate results. Final validation confirms b and c are the only elements participating in non-commutative operations.
