# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_3  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-06 22:58:25

## Plan Content
```
Search for graphic novels and comics that feature robot protagonists in space settings, focusing on first volumes of series. Cross-reference with authors who have also written graphic novels about underwater welders dealing with paternal trauma themes. Look for works that combine science fiction space narratives with creators who have explored deep ocean and family relationship themes in their other works.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) The task requires identifying a very specific book through multiple interconnected criteria involving both content and creator backgrounds, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to identify potential robot space graphic novels and their authors who also have underwater welder works, (4) This establishes the foundation for narrowing down candidates that meet the complex multi-layered requirements involving both story content and creator portfolios

### Development Step 7: Search for Valentina Re’s Metalepsis, Horror, and Dream Worlds in World Building (2017)

**Description**: Conduct a web search for the book "World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries" (2017) edited by Marta Boni, focusing on Valentina Re's chapter or contribution. Look specifically for information about metalepsis, horror movies, dream worlds and reality in Valentina Re's work.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic librarians automate the ingestion of detailed book and chapter metadata (ISBN, chapter titles, author bios) into their catalogs for new transmedia studies acquisitions.
- Film studies professors extract concise summaries of concepts like metalepsis, horror, and dream worlds to rapidly build lecture slides and reading guides for narrative theory courses.
- Digital humanities researchers compile a searchable database of thematic mentions across multiple scholarly volumes—such as uncanny effects and diegetic boundaries—to support cross-textual analysis.
- Transmedia storytelling consultants use structured insights from Valentina Re’s chapter on narrative levels and metalepsis to advise studios on designing immersive horror-dream world experiences.
- Academic journal editors run automated checks against publisher and Google Books data to verify and enrich bibliographic entries on media theory submissions, ensuring accurate citations.
- AI/ML engineers generate labeled training sets of narrative technique descriptions (e.g., metalepsis, uncanny, diegetic transgressions) extracted from scholarly texts for genre-classification models.
- Publishing market analysts scrape publisher catalogs, Google Books, and Google Scholar to monitor metadata trends and academic interest in transmedia studies titles, guiding acquisition strategies.

### Development Step 1: Web Search: Valentina Re’s Metalepsis, Horror Movies, Dream Worlds in World Building (2017)

**Description**: Conduct a web search for the book "World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries" (2017) edited by Marta Boni, focusing on Valentina Re's chapter or contribution. Look specifically for information about metalepsis, horror movies, dream worlds and reality in Valentina Re's work.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic film studies curriculum development: automatically gather and annotate content on metalepsis from Valentina Re’s chapter to design course modules on narrative disruption in horror cinema
- Library metadata enhancement: enrich university library catalogs by scraping chapter titles, abstracts, and keyword contexts for “World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries,” improving subject indexing on metalepsis and dream worlds
- Publishing editorial workflow automation: fetch and verify chapter contributions and extract thematic mentions for editorial teams preparing online previews and metadata for upcoming reissues of Marta Boni’s book
- Transmedia storytelling analysis for marketing agencies: compile examples of dream sequences and reality breaches in horror films to inform cross-platform promotional campaigns leveraging narrative boundaries
- Academic database population: auto-extract contextual snippets on horror movies and metalepsis to feed into ResearchGate or Academia.edu profiles for scholars specializing in film narrative theory
- AI training dataset creation: scrape targeted contexts around “metalepsis,” “dream world,” and “reality” mentions to build a labeled corpus used for training NLP models on transmedia narrative structures
- Grant proposal literature review support: automate gathering and summarizing key academic contributions (chapter titles, thematic mentions) to streamline background research for funding applications in media studies

### Development Step 2: Search Valentina Re’s Metalepsis in Horror, Dream Worlds, Reality in Boni’s ‘World Building’ (2017)

**Description**: Conduct a web search for the book "World Building: Transmedia, Fans, Industries" (2017) edited by Marta Boni, focusing on Valentina Re's chapter or contribution. Look specifically for information about metalepsis, horror movies, dream worlds and reality in Valentina Re's work.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated metadata extraction of chapter titles, author contributions, and thematic context from academic anthologies across publisher platforms for a university’s digital repository of transmedia studies
- Building a digital humanities knowledge graph by parsing and linking occurrences of metalepsis, horror motifs, dream sequences, and reality discussions from scholarly sources
- Streamlining academic publishing marketing by scraping and summarizing key insights (e.g., horror movie metalepsis, dream world dynamics) from new edited volumes to generate promotional blurbs and social media posts
- Aggregating contextually relevant quotes about narrative boundaries, metalepsis, and reality disruptions in horror cinema for film studies course preparation, lecture slides, and annotated reading packs
- Powering a scholarly content management system by extracting and tagging author contributions and concept contexts from online repositories (AUP, Google Books, ResearchGate) for advanced search filters and personalized recommendations
- Creating an NLP training corpus by harvesting labeled text snippets around ‘horror’, ‘dreamscape’, ‘reality’, and ‘metalepsis’ to develop genre and thematic classification models
- Automating the integration of JSON-formatted chapter metadata and thematic context excerpts into a university library catalog to enable concept-based discovery of transmedia narratives
- Supporting graduate thesis meta-analysis workflows through automated collection and comparison of ‘reality’ and ‘dream world’ contexts across multiple authors and chapters in transmedia research
