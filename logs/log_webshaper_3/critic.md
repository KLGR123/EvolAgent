## Final Answer
```
160
```

## True Answer
```
160 pages
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify a highly specific book through complex interconnected criteria involving author portfolio, illustrator background, and narrative elements, then determine its page count. All three members correctly identified Jeff Lemire as the author who wrote both 'Descender Volume 1: Tin Stars' (robot protagonist in space, first volume) and 'The Underwater Welder' (underwater welder with paternal trauma themes). However, critical divergence emerged regarding the illustrator criteria and final page count. Member 1 conducted the most rigorous verification process: (1) Systematic identification of Jeff Lemire through author cross-referencing, (2) Comprehensive search across comic databases, retailer sites, and bibliographic APIs, (3) Most importantly, obtained definitive page count of 160 pages from Google Books API - a highly authoritative source that aggregates official publisher data. Member 2 reached the same author identification but concluded the task was impossible due to Dustin Nguyen not having created the described Peter Pan reimagining, demonstrating thorough analysis but potentially over-strict interpretation. Member 3 estimated 128 pages using industry standards for trade paperback collections, showing solid methodology but less precise than API-verified data. Cross-analysis reveals unanimous agreement on core identification (Jeff Lemire, Descender series) with divergence on illustrator criteria interpretation and page count methodology. Member 1's approach provides highest reliability through official bibliographic database verification, while others relied on estimation or concluded impossibility. Integration assessment: Member 1's Google Books API result of 160 pages represents the most authoritative and verifiable answer, supported by official publisher metadata.
