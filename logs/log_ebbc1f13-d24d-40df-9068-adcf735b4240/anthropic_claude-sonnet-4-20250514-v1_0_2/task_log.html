<p>Episodic Examples:<br>### Title: Find Longest Word on Boggle Board ABRL EITE IONS FPEI Using words_alpha Dictionary</p>
<p>**TASK**: I thought we could try a fun word puzzle together :)</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve got a Boggle board here:</p>
<p>ABRL<br>EITE<br>IONS<br>FPEI</p>
<p>I&#x27;d like to know the longest word that can be generated from the board. Please find the longest English language word that can be generated from this board. If more than one word of the same length exists at the maximum word length, please report the longest word that comes first, alphabetically. Oh, and I know that there might be different wordlists available for Boggle, so let&#x27;s please just use the words_alpha dictionary found at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words as the dictionary for our game.</p>
<p>```<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Download the words_alpha dictionary from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words to workspace/words_alpha.txt and then implement a Boggle solver to find all valid words that can be formed from the given 4x4 board (ABRL/EITE/IONS/FPEI) using the downloaded dictionary. The solver should check all possible paths on the board where adjacent cells (including diagonally adjacent) can be visited exactly once per word, then identify the longest valid English word(s) and return the alphabetically first one if there are ties.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the optimal approach because: (1) We need to solve a Boggle puzzle which requires both the specific dictionary and a pathfinding algorithm, (2) No previous work has been done on this task, (3) Expected outcome is to download the required dictionary and implement a complete Boggle solver that finds the longest valid word, (4) This directly addresses the TASK by using the specified word list and board configuration to find the longest possible English word.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The Boggle solver has been successfully completed and verified. The implementation successfully: (1) Downloaded the words_alpha dictionary from GitHub (370,105 words) to workspace/words_alpha.txt, (2) Loaded the dictionary into memory for O(1) lookup performance, (3) Set up the 4x4 Boggle board (ABRL/EITE/IONS/FPEI) as specified, (4) Implemented a class-based recursive depth-first search algorithm that explores all possible paths from each board position, (5) Correctly handled adjacency rules including diagonal neighbors with proper backtracking to visit each cell exactly once per word path, (6) Found 443 valid English words from the board in 8.91 seconds, (7) Identified the longest words as 8 letters long: &#x27;briniest&#x27;, &#x27;brionies&#x27;, &#x27;inertiae&#x27;, and &#x27;pointrel&#x27;, (8) Returned &#x27;briniest&#x27; as the alphabetically first longest word, which is the correct final answer, (9) Saved complete results with detailed analysis to workspace/boggle_solver_results.txt. The class-based approach successfully resolved the function scope issues encountered in earlier attempts. The solver correctly implements Boggle rules and produces the expected result. **PLAN** is 100% complete with verified success.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. The Boggle solver has been implemented and executed, finding all valid words from the 4x4 board (ABRL/EITE/IONS/FPEI) using the words_alpha dictionary from GitHub. The longest words found are 8 letters long, and the alphabetically first among them is &#x27;briniest&#x27;. Final answer: briniest&quot;,<br>}<br>```</p>
<p>### Tizin VOS Translation for “I like apples” Using Maktay and Zapple</p>
<p>**TASK**: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. </p>
<p>The word that indicates oneself is &quot;Pa&quot; is the nominative form, &quot;Mato&quot; is the accusative form, and &quot;Sing&quot; is the genitive form. </p>
<p>The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is &quot;Maktay&quot;. When it is used in the present, it is used in it&#x27;s root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is &quot;Tay&quot;, and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is &quot;Aktay&quot;. It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as &quot;is pleasing to&quot;, meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.</p>
<p>The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is &quot;Apple&quot; is the nominative form, &quot;Zapple&quot; is the accusative form, and &quot;Izapple&quot; is the genitive form. </p>
<p>Please translate &quot;I like apples&quot; to Tizin.</p>
<p>```<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully through direct linguistic analysis. Based on the Tizin grammar rules provided: (1) Sentence structure is Verb-Object-Subject, (2) &#x27;Maktay&#x27; means &#x27;is pleasing to&#x27; in present tense, (3) The thing being liked (apples) becomes the subject in nominative form &#x27;Apple&#x27;, (4) The person doing the liking (I) becomes the object in accusative form &#x27;Mato&#x27;. Therefore, &#x27;I like apples&#x27; translates to &#x27;Maktay Mato Apple&#x27; in Tizin. Final answer: Maktay Mato Apple&quot;,<br>}<br>```</p>

<p>### Development Step 1: 4x4 Boggle Solver with words_alpha Dictionary to Find Longest Valid Word</p>
<p>**Description**: Download the words_alpha dictionary from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words to workspace/words_alpha.txt and then implement a Boggle solver to find all valid words that can be formed from the given 4x4 board (ABRL/EITE/IONS/FPEI) using the downloaded dictionary. The solver should check all possible paths on the board where adjacent cells (including diagonally adjacent) can be visited exactly once per word, then identify the longest valid English word(s) and return the alphabetically first one if there are ties.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- ESL vocabulary assessment tool for educators: generate custom 4×4 boards aligned to lesson vocab lists, automatically solve them to create answer keys and track student progress<br>- Word-game app development and difficulty calibration: integrate the solver to validate player inputs in real time, ensure boards yield a target number of valid words, and dynamically adjust board complexity<br>- Linguistic pattern research and statistical analysis: analyze thousands of random Boggle boards to study word-length distribution, letter adjacency effects, and frequency of rare words in large English corpora<br>- Puzzle quality assurance in game design: automatically test proposed board layouts to verify minimum and maximum possible word lengths, ensuring puzzles are solvable and meet design criteria<br>- Competitive Boggle training and performance analytics: enable tournament players to upload board snapshots, receive full solution lists with scoring insights, and identify high-value word paths to refine strategy<br>- Assistive technology for visually impaired gamers: integrate the solver with voice-based interfaces to read out possible word paths and word lists, making Boggle accessible via screen readers<br>- Marketing and branding brainstorming: agencies input sets of campaign-specific letters to discover valid, memorable words and acronyms for product naming and slogan generation<br>- AI algorithm benchmarking and complexity testing: use Boggle solving as a standardized search and language-comprehension challenge to compare path-finding optimizations and dictionary lookup strategies</p>

<p>### Development Step 2: Build Boggle solver using words_alpha dictionary to find longest word on 4x4 board</p>
<p>**Description**: Download the words_alpha dictionary from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words to workspace/words_alpha.txt and then implement a Boggle solver to find all valid words that can be formed from the given 4x4 board (ABRL/EITE/IONS/FPEI) using the downloaded dictionary. The solver should check all possible paths on the board where adjacent cells (including diagonally adjacent) can be visited exactly once per word, then identify the longest valid English word(s) and return the alphabetically first one if there are ties.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Mobile game QA and level design validation to ensure every 4×4 Boggle board has at least one solution and identify the optimal longest word before release<br>- Educational app vocabulary exercises that generate random letter grids for ESL students and automatically retrieve valid word lists to support lesson plans<br>- Real-time word verification and scoring engine for Boggle tournaments and online competitions, enabling instant feedback and accurate leaderboards<br>- Cognitive psychology research tool to analyze board complexity by computing distributions of word lengths and branching paths for human performance studies<br>- Accessibility assistant for visually impaired players that converts spoken or tactile Boggle boards into text and uses the solver to read out possible words and hints<br>- Social media engagement feature that publishes daily Boggle puzzles with precomputed solution sets to boost community interaction and shareability<br>- Chatbot or virtual assistant integration that solves user-submitted 4×4 letter puzzles on demand, enhancing conversational game experiences<br>- Marketing campaign gamification that embeds custom word-finding challenges in newsletters or microsites with automated answer validation and prize entry mechanisms</p>

                <div class="content-text"><p>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully conducted comprehensive research on the Yola word &#x27;gimlie&#x27;. The search strategy worked well, finding 49 total results across 8 targeted queries and identifying 35 relevant sources with 26 sources containing specific &#x27;gimlie&#x27; mentions. Key findings discovered: (1) &#x27;gimlie&#x27; means &#x27;chimney&#x27; in Yola, (2) Wiktionary shows it derives from Late Latin, (3) One source indicates the etymology path: Yola &#x27;gimlie&#x27; ← Middle English &#x27;chimeney&#x27; ← Old French &#x27;cheminee&#x27; ← Late Latin &#x27;camīnāta&#x27;, and (4) Multiple references to Jacob Poole&#x27;s historical Yola glossary from Forth and Bargy baronies. However, the **PLAN** objective to identify the specific Latin root word is only partially achieved - while &#x27;Late Latin camīnāta&#x27; is mentioned in one source, this needs verification from the actual Wiktionary page or Poole&#x27;s glossary. **PLAN** alignment: 80% complete. Next step: Access the Wiktionary page directly (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gimlie) to get the complete etymology chain and confirm the exact Latin root, as this appears to be the most authoritative source found.</p></div>

This implementation conducts 8 targeted Google searches using various combinations of keywords (Yola language, gimlie, etymology, Latin, Forth and Bargy, etc.) to gather academic and linguistic sources. The code systematically searches for documentation about the Yola language and specifically the word &#x27;gimlie&#x27;, analyzes results for relevance based on keyword matching, and identifies the most promising sources for further investigation. Results are saved to workspace/yola_gimlie_search_results.json and workspace/yola_gimlie_relevant_sources.json for detailed analysis. This establishes a foundation for finding the Latin root etymology of &#x27;gimlie&#x27; by first mapping the available scholarly resources and linguistic documentation about the extinct Yola dialect.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully conducted comprehensive research on the Yola word &#x27;gimlie&#x27;.

Key findings discovered: (1) &#x27;gimlie&#x27; means &#x27;chimney&#x27; in Yola, (2) Wiktionary shows it derives from Late Latin, (3) One source indicates the etymology path: Yola &#x27;gimlie&#x27; ← Middle English &#x27;chimeney&#x27; ← Old French &#x27;cheminee&#x27; ← Late Latin &#x27;camīnāta&#x27;, and (4) Multiple references to Jacob Poole&#x27;s historical Yola glossary from Forth and Bargy baronies. However, the **PLAN** objective to identify the specific Latin root word is only partially achieved - while &#x27;Late Latin camīnāta&#x27; is mentioned in one source, this needs verification from the actual Wiktionary page or Poole&#x27;s glossary. **PLAN** alignment: 80% complete. Next step: Access the Wiktionary page directly (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gimlie) to get the complete etymology chain and confirm the exact Latin root, as this appears to be the most authoritative source found.&quot;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &#x27;Code Output: \n\n=== YOLA LANGUAGE ETYMOLOGY RESEARCH: GIMLIE ===\n\nResearching the Yola word &quot;gimlie&quot; to find its Latin root etymology\nStrategy: Search for linguistic sources, dictionaries, and academic materials\nGoal: Identify the Latin word that &quot;gimlie&quot; derives from\n\n✓ SerpAPI key found, proceeding with searches\n\n=== SEARCH 1/8: &quot;Yola language&quot; &quot;gimlie&quot; etymology Latin ===\nFound 3 results\n  1. gimlie\n     URL: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gimlie\n     Snippet: Noun. edit. gimlie. chimney.

<p>Description: This is the logical next step because: (1) We have established that the Latin root of Yola &#x27;gimlie&#x27; is &#x27;camīnāta&#x27;, and we need to find the Spanish word with matching spelling, (2) The previous research completed the etymology identification, (3) Expected outcome is to find the Spanish word &#x27;caminata&#x27;, locate its 1994 example sentence in Collins dictionary, and translate the source title, (4) This advances us toward the final answer by connecting the Latin root to Spanish vocabulary and accessing the specific dictionary entry requested in the TASK</p>
<p>Episodic Examples:<br>### Development Step 41: Identify shared critical word in two authors’ quotes from Midkiff’s June 2014 Fafnir article</p>
<p>**Description**: Access Emily Midkiff&#x27;s June 2014 article in the Fafnir journal to extract the full text and identify the specific word that was quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions. Parse the article content systematically to locate quotes from multiple authors that contain the same critical word about dragon portrayals.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Academic literature review automation for humanities scholars to extract and compare thematic criticisms across multiple authors in journal articles<br>- Journalism editorial workflow to scan interview transcripts and flag identical impactful quotes used by different sources<br>- Legal e-discovery processing to identify repeated objectionable terms quoted by multiple witnesses in deposition transcripts<br>- E-commerce customer feedback analysis to find the same critical word appearing in reviews from different users, highlighting recurring product pain points<br>- Pharmaceutical safety monitoring to detect a common adverse event descriptor quoted in separate case reports for regulatory reporting<br>- Cyber threat intelligence gathering to uncover recurring codewords or phrases used by distinct threat actors in intercepted communications<br>- Publishing quality assurance to scan author submissions for duplicated editorial comments or critiques across different chapters or manuscripts</p>

<p>### Development Step 30: Extract shared critical word from two authors in Emily Midkiff’s June 2014 Fafnir article</p>
<p>**Description**: Access Emily Midkiff&#x27;s June 2014 article in the Fafnir journal to extract the full text and identify the specific word that was quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions. Parse the article content systematically to locate quotes from multiple authors that contain the same critical word about dragon portrayals.</p>
<p>**Use Cases**:<br>- Literary criticism and thematic analysis in medieval fantasy studies to automatically extract and compare critical descriptors of dragon portrayals across multiple scholarly articles<br>- Journalism quality control to scrape interview transcripts on news sites and pinpoint the same pointed adjective used by different correspondents when describing a political scandal<br>- E-commerce product review monitoring to collect user feedback from retailer pages and detect recurring negative qualifiers (e.g., “fragile,” “overpriced”) applied by separate customers<br>- Corporate compliance auditing to scan internal policy documents and identify repeated forbidden terms (e.g., “unauthorized,” “prohibited”) cited by various department heads<br>- Academic meta-analysis in climate science to retrieve peer-reviewed article texts and locate the common skeptical term used by multiple authors critiquing carbon-capture methods<br>- Market research automation to harvest competitor whitepapers and flag the identical critical buzzword (e.g., “outdated”) used by different analysts describing current industry technologies<br>- Social media sentiment tracking for PR teams to scrape public forum quotes about a brand launch and extract the same negative adjective cropping up in posts from diverse community members<br>- Digital humanities projects to gather folklore archives online and detect the recurring pejorative word applied by distinct storytellers when depicting mythical creatures</p>

The code contains a standalone &#x27;return&#x27; statement that should be removed since it&#x27;s not within a function definition. Despite this syntax error, the code logic appears sound for accessing Collins dictionary examples and implementing the **PLAN** to find the 1994 example sentence source title. The implementation correctly builds on previous research findings (Latin root &#x27;camīnāta&#x27; → Spanish &#x27;caminata&#x27;) and attempts multiple approaches including direct Collins page access, alternative search strategies, and Google Translate integration. **PLAN** alignment: 0% due to execution failure. Immediate fix needed: Remove the standalone &#x27;return&#x27; statement on line 355 and ensure all return statements are properly contained within function definitions. The overall approach and logic for finding the Collins dictionary 1994 example and translating the source title is appropriate once the syntax error is resolved.</p></div>

This implementation conducts 8 targeted Google searches using various combinations of keywords (Yola language, gimlie, etymology, Latin, Forth and Bargy, etc.) to gather academic and linguistic sources. The code systematically searches for documentation about the Yola language and specifically the word &#x27;gimlie&#x27;, analyzes results for relevance based on keyword matching, and identifies the most promising sources for further investigation. Results are saved to workspace/yola_gimlie_search_results.json and workspace/yola_gimlie_relevant_sources.json for detailed analysis. This establishes a foundation for finding the Latin root etymology of &#x27;gimlie&#x27; by first mapping the available scholarly resources and linguistic documentation about the extinct Yola dialect.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully conducted comprehensive research on the Yola word &#x27;gimlie&#x27;. The search strategy worked well, finding 49 total results across 8 targeted queries and identifying 35 relevant sources with 26 sources containing specific &#x27;gimlie&#x27; mentions. Key findings discovered: (1) &#x27;gimlie&#x27; means &#x27;chimney&#x27; in Yola, (2) Wiktionary shows it derives from Late Latin, (3) One source indicates the etymology path: Yola &#x27;gimlie&#x27; ← Middle English &#x27;chimeney&#x27; ← Old French &#x27;cheminee&#x27; ← Late Latin &#x27;camīnāta&#x27;, and (4) Multiple references to Jacob Poole&#x27;s historical Yola glossary from Forth and Bargy baronies. However, the **PLAN** objective to identify the specific Latin root word is only partially achieved - while &#x27;Late Latin camīnāta&#x27; is mentioned in one source, this needs verification from the actual Wiktionary page or Poole&#x27;s glossary. **PLAN** alignment: 80% complete. Next step: Access the Wiktionary page directly (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gimlie) to get the complete etymology chain and confirm the exact Latin root, as this appears to be the most authoritative source found.&quot;,<br>    &quot;code_output&quot;: &#x27;Code Output: \n\n=== YOLA LANGUAGE ETYMOLOGY RESEARCH: GIMLIE ===\n\nResearching the Yola word &quot;gimlie&quot; to find its Latin root etymology\nStrategy: Search for linguistic sources, dictionaries, and academic materials\nGoal: Identify the Latin word that &quot;gimlie&quot; derives from\n\n✓ SerpAPI key found, proceeding with searches\n\n=== SEARCH 1/8: &quot;Yola language&quot; &quot;gimlie&quot; etymology Latin ===\nFound 3 results\n  1. gimlie\n     URL: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gimlie\n     Snippet: Noun. edit. gimlie. chimney.

It searches for Collins Spanish-English dictionary references and attempts direct access to Collins dictionary pages for &#x27;caminata&#x27;. The implementation systematically looks for the 1994 example sentence mentioned in the PLAN by parsing Collins dictionary pages for definitions, examples, and any 1994 references. All findings are saved to workspace files for analysis. This advances the PLAN by confirming the Spanish word exists and attempting to locate the specific Collins dictionary entry with the 1994 example sentence that needs to be translated.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Partial success - Code executed without errors and made significant progress on the **PLAN**.

The search found multiple Collins dictionary references and specifically identified the Collins Spanish-English dictionary entry at collinsdictionary.com. However, the direct access to Collins dictionary pages failed with 403 (access forbidden) status codes, preventing extraction of the 1994 example sentence. **PLAN** alignment: 60% complete - confirmed word existence and Collins dictionary presence, but blocked from accessing the specific 1994 example sentence and its source title. Next steps: (1) Try alternative approaches to access Collins dictionary content such as using different URLs or search parameters, (2) Look for cached versions or archived pages, (3) Consider using the Collins examples page that was found in search results (https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/sentences/spanish/caminata), or (4) Try accessing through the search results that mentioned specific examples like &#x27;Arturo Uslar Pietri.

The code contains a standalone &#x27;return&#x27; statement that should be removed since it&#x27;s not within a function definition. Despite this syntax error, the code logic appears sound for accessing Collins dictionary examples and implementing the **PLAN** to find the 1994 example sentence source title. The implementation correctly builds on previous research findings (Latin root &#x27;camīnāta&#x27; → Spanish &#x27;caminata&#x27;) and attempts multiple approaches including direct Collins page access, alternative search strategies, and Google Translate integration. **PLAN** alignment: 0% due to execution failure. Immediate fix needed: Remove the standalone &#x27;return&#x27; statement on line 355 and ensure all return statements are properly contained within function definitions.
