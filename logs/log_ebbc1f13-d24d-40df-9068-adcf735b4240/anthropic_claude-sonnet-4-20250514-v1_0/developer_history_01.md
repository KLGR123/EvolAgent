    "description": "Initial search implementation to find information about the Yola word 'gimlie' and its Latin etymology. This code performs comprehensive Google searches using 6 different query variations targeting linguistic sources, etymology dictionaries, and academic papers about Yola language vocabulary. The search strategy covers multiple angles: (1) Direct etymology searches combining 'Yola', 'gimlie', 'etymology', and 'Latin root', (2) Linguistic analysis searches focusing on Yola vocabulary studies, (3) Dictionary-focused searches for Yola word meanings, (4) Forth and Bargy dialect searches (alternate name for Yola), (5) Extinct Irish English searches to capture broader linguistic contexts, and (6) Comprehensive Yola dictionary searches. The code systematically collects all search results, analyzes them for etymology-related keywords, categorizes findings by relevance (etymology mentions, Latin references, Yola-specific content), and saves comprehensive results to workspace/yola_gimlie_search_results.txt for further analysis. This establishes the foundation for identifying the most promising linguistic sources that can provide information about 'gimlie's Latin root.",

    "feedback": 'Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully found relevant information about the Yola word \'gimlie\' and its Latin root. The search discovered 11 results across 6 different queries, with 10 results specifically mentioning Yola language and 4 mentioning Latin connections. Most importantly, the search found a direct answer to the **PLAN** objective: Result 3 from the first search explicitly states \'This research confirms that the Latin root of the Yola word "gimlie" is "caminata"\'. The Wiktionary entry for \'gimlie\' also provides etymology tracing it through Middle English \'chimeney\' from Old French, and categorizes it under \'Yola terms derived from Late Latin\'. The code properly saved all results to \'workspace/yola_gimlie_search_results.txt\' for future reference. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the Latin root \'caminata\' has been identified for the Yola word \'gimlie\'. No further development needed as the core research objective has been achieved.',

The analysis successfully extracted and confirmed the key finding from the research: the Latin root of the Yola word \'gimlie\' is \'caminata\'. The code effectively parsed the 6,517-character results file, identified 2 mentions of \'caminata\' and 8 mentions of \'latin root\', and found direct research confirmation stating \'This research confirms that the Latin root of the Yola word "gimlie" is "caminata"\'. The analysis also traced the etymological path from Late Latin \'caminata\' through Old French and Middle English \'chimeney\' to Yola \'gimlie\', and properly saved a concise summary to \'yola_gimlie_latin_root_summary.txt\'. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the objective to identify the Latin root of \'gimlie\' has been fully achieved with high confidence from multiple corroborating sources.
