I'm performing two targeted searches: (1) A general search for 'Yola language gimlie etymology Latin root' to find direct etymological information, and (2) A specific search for 'Yola language dictionary Forth and Bargy dialect Ireland' to locate authoritative dictionary sources that might contain the word. The Yola language was a dialect of Middle English spoken in County Wexford, Ireland, so focusing on Irish linguistic resources and historical dictionaries. Both search results are being saved to workspace files for detailed analysis. This approach will help identify relevant academic sources, dictionaries, or linguistic studies that document the word 'gimlie' and trace its Latin origins, which is essential for the next step of finding the Spanish word that shares the same spelling as the Latin root.",
