# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Parse and analyze both attached files: the job listing PDF (data/gaia/2023/validation/bfcd99e1-0690-4b53-a85c-0174a8629083/Job Listing.pdf) and the applicants Excel file (data/gaia/2023/validation/bfcd99e1-0690-4b53-a85c-0174a8629083/Applicants.xlsx). Extract the complete job requirements and qualifications from the PDF, then extract all applicant information and their qualifications from the Excel file. Compare each applicant's qualifications against the job requirements to identify which applicants are missing exactly one qualification.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand both the job requirements structure and applicant qualification data before determining qualification gaps, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on these files, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete job requirements list and all applicant qualification profiles extracted and organized, (4) This provides the foundation needed to systematically compare each applicant against requirements and count those missing exactly one qualification as requested in the TASK

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Parse PDF to Extract Seahorse Island Accommodation Types and Compare Their Average Ratings

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/67e8878b-5cef-4375-804e-e6291fdbe78a.pdf to extract information about all accommodations in Seahorse Island. Identify the different types of accommodations (such as hotels, motels, rental houses, campgrounds, etc.) and their corresponding ratings. Calculate the average rating for each accommodation type to determine which type has the highest average rating.

**Use Cases**:
- Tourism board of Seahorse Island uses automated PDF parsing to aggregate and compare average guest ratings of hotels, motels, rental houses, and campgrounds for their annual visitor satisfaction report.
- Hotel chain operations team extracts competitor ratings from public PDF brochures to benchmark performance across their various property types and pinpoint underperforming segments.
- Online travel agency automates extraction and analysis of PDF property review sheets to continuously update their website’s top-rated lodging categories based on up-to-date guest scores.
- Municipal parks department processes campground inspection PDF reports, categorizes sites (traditional campsite, glamping, RV hookup), and calculates average safety and satisfaction ratings for targeted maintenance planning.
- Market research firm parses supplier PDF catalogs of electronics, classifies items into laptops, tablets, and accessories, then computes average customer review scores to advise retail buyers on the highest-rating segments.
- Real estate investment group analyzes PDF property assessment documents, classifies residential units (apartments, condos, single-family homes), and computes average condition ratings to guide acquisition and renovation priorities.
- Event planning agency automates parsing of venue PDF data sheets, categorizes spaces (ballroom, conference rooms, outdoor pavilions), and computes average attendee feedback ratings to recommend the best fit for corporate retreats.

### Development Step 2: Seahorse Island Full-House Rentals With Swimming Amenities, Family-Friendly Features, and Availability Status

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/366e2f2b-8632-4ef2-81eb-bc3877489217.pdf to extract information about all accommodations in Seahorse Island. Focus on identifying properties that offer full house rentals and have swimming amenities (pools, beach access, or water features). Extract details including accommodation names, property types, amenities, availability status, and any family-friendly features to enable comparison of options suitable for a family seeking a full house with swimming facilities.

**Use Cases**:
- Travel agency itinerary automation by parsing PDF catalogs of Seahorse Island lodgings to curate full-house rentals with pools and beach access for family vacation packages
- Vacation rental aggregator platform extracting detailed amenities and availability from island property PDF reports to dynamically update swim-friendly listings for parents planning trips
- Real estate investment analysis tool processing PDF accommodation data to evaluate full-house rentals with water features for ROI projections and portfolio diversification
- Local tourism board content management system summarizing PDF accommodation brochures to highlight family-oriented swim-enabled properties on official island visitor websites
- Property management CRM integration that ingests PDF booking and amenity details to automatically recommend available family-friendly houses with pools to repeat guests
- Hospitality market research solution scanning competitor PDF listings to identify gaps in full-house swim amenity offerings on Seahorse Island for strategic service expansion
- Insurance underwriting pre-screening process parsing PDF descriptions of rental houses with water features to assess property risk and streamline quote generation for seasonal policies

### Development Step 1: Extract Full-House Rentals with Swimming Amenities on Seahorse Island

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/366e2f2b-8632-4ef2-81eb-bc3877489217.pdf to extract information about all accommodations in Seahorse Island. Focus on identifying properties that offer full house rentals and have swimming amenities (pools, beach access, or water features). Extract details including accommodation names, property types, amenities, availability status, and any family-friendly features to enable comparison of options suitable for a family seeking a full house with swimming facilities.

**Use Cases**:
- Real estate agents consolidating Seahorse Island property PDFs to present families with full-house rentals that include private pools and beachfront access
- Vacation rental marketplaces automating ingestion of host-submitted PDF brochures to update listings of island villas with water features and real-time availability
- Travel agencies extracting family-friendly full-house options with swimming amenities from sealed PDF catalogs to craft customized holiday itineraries
- Hospitality consulting firms benchmarking pool-equipped full-house rentals on Seahorse Island by parsing competitor PDF offerings to identify amenity trends and pricing strategies
- Insurance underwriters assessing water-related risk factors in full-house accommodations on Seahorse Island by extracting property layouts and swimming amenity details from regulatory PDFs
- Local tourism boards generating interactive online guides by extracting names, availability, and amenity details of full-house rentals with pools from official PDF reports
- Event planners organizing offshore corporate retreats by automatically filtering PDF portfolios for large island rentals with beach access and private pools suitable for team-building

### Development Step 1: Seahorse Island Accommodation Types and Average Ratings Analysis

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/67e8878b-5cef-4375-804e-e6291fdbe78a.pdf to extract information about all accommodations in Seahorse Island. Identify the different types of accommodations (such as hotels, motels, rental houses, campgrounds, etc.) and their corresponding ratings. Calculate the average rating for each accommodation type to determine which type has the highest average rating.

**Use Cases**:
- Hotel chain competitor benchmarking using extracted Seahorse Island accommodation ratings to identify service gaps and improve guest satisfaction
- Tourism board destination quality assessment by aggregating PDF data on hotels, motels, and campgrounds to guide marketing campaigns
- Real estate investment analysis for short-term rental houses on Seahorse Island by computing average ratings to forecast ROI
- Park services maintenance planning through campground rating extraction from conservation reports to prioritize facility upgrades
- Travel agency itinerary optimization by parsing PDF accommodation listings and ratings to recommend top-rated stays
- Hospitality compliance monitoring by automated PDF auditing of inn and lodge service scores to enforce brand standards
- Academic tourism research on lodging preferences using structured PDF data to correlate accommodation types with visitor satisfaction
- Vacation rental platform enrichment by ingesting PDF-based accommodation details and ratings to enhance user recommendation algorithms
