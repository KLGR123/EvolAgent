  "final_answer": "Putting It Together",
  "true_answer": "Side by Side by Sondheim",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify a Stephen Sondheim musical revue staged by a theatre company that also staged the world premiere of a Baroness Orczy adaptation. This requires finding the intersection of two specific theatrical productions through their shared producing organization. Individual solution evaluation: Member 1 conducted systematic research identifying Roundabout Theatre Company as staging 'Putting It Together' during 1999-2000 Broadway season and also producing Baroness Orczy adaptations, with comprehensive cross-reference analysis across 31 files providing high methodological rigor. Member 2 initially identified multiple potential connections but ultimately determined Mirvish Productions staged both 'Putting It Together' and 'The Scarlet Pimpernel Musical' world premiere (1997), with strong timeline correlation and production scale analysis supporting this conclusion. Member 3 identified Paper Mill Playhouse as staging 'Side by Side by Sondheim' and claimed they staged the world premiere of a Baroness Orczy adaptation, but this analysis contained critical gaps in definitively establishing world premiere status. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on 'Putting It Together' from Members 1 and 2, while Member 3 diverged to 'Side by Side by Sondheim'. Contradiction resolution: Members 1 and 2 both identified 'Putting It Together' through different but valid research paths (Roundabout Theatre Company vs Mirvish Productions), while Member 3's conclusion relied on likelihood assessment rather than confirmed world premiere evidence. Integration assessment: The convergence of two independent research approaches on 'Putting It Together' provides strong validation, with both Members 1 and 2 demonstrating thorough methodology and documentation. Final validation: 'Putting It Together' represents the most reliable answer supported by multiple independent research paths and comprehensive evidence.",
