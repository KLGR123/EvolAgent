The analysis considered factors including regional presence in eastern Poland/Bielsk County, organizational size and operational capability, known 1943 operations, and casualty scales. Armia Krajowa scored highest (8/8) due to their strong presence in eastern Poland, large membership (400,000 fighters), documented anti-German partisan activities in rural areas during 1943, and casualty scale indicating capability for sustaining 25 deaths in a single operation.
