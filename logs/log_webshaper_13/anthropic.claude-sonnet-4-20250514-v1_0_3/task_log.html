🎯 CONCLUSION:
---------------
While the web search API is currently unavailable due to quota limits,
the research methodology was sound and comprehensive. The 8 targeted
search queries were well-designed to identify the specific Polish
resistance group involved in the July 1943 Bielsk County skirmish.

Alternative research approaches through historical archives, academic
databases, and specialized WWII resistance sources should be pursued
to complete this historical investigation.

🔍 NEXT STEPS:
1. Access Polish historical archives (IPN, PAN)
2. Search academic databases for peer-reviewed research
3. Consult specialized WWII resistance literature
4. Contact local Bielsk County historical societies
5. Review German wartime records for casualty reports

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed a comprehensive analysis of the failed search results. The analysis correctly identified that all 8 web searches failed due to SerpAPI quota exhaustion (HTTP 429 errors), preventing any retrieval of Polish resistance group data. The code successfully processed the existing search metadata file, provided detailed failure analysis, and created valuable alternative research strategies. **PLAN** alignment: Partial (30%) - while no specific Polish resistance group was identified due to API limitations, the code delivered a thorough analysis of why the search failed and provided comprehensive alternative research approaches including Polish historical archives (IPN), academic databases (JSTOR), specialized WWII literature, and regional sources. The output includes detailed research strategies saved to &#x27;workspace_webshaper_13/polish_resistance_research_analysis.json&#x27; and &#x27;workspace_webshaper_13/polish_resistance_research_strategy.txt&#x27;. Since web search API is unavailable, the **PLAN** objective cannot be completed through this method - alternative research approaches through historical archives and academic sources must be pursued to identify the specific resistance group involved in the July 1943 Bielsk County skirmish.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution failed - All DuckDuckGo API searches failed with HTTP 202 status codes, indicating the API requests were accepted but not processed, resulting in zero search results. The code attempted an alternative search approach using DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API after SerpAPI quota exhaustion, but this backup method also failed to retrieve any Polish resistance group information. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no historical data about the July 1943 Bielsk County skirmish was obtained. The code structure was sound and properly handled the API failures, saving metadata to &#x27;workspace_webshaper_13/polish_resistance_ddg_search_20250807_012255.json&#x27;, but this file contains only failure information. All 8 targeted queries failed (0/8 successful searches), leaving the research objective unmet. Recommended next steps: (1) The DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API appears to have limitations for historical research queries, (2) Consider implementing direct web scraping of historical websites, (3) Access academic databases directly, or (4) Use library/archive APIs that specialize in WWII historical records. The web search approach has now failed with both SerpAPI and DuckDuckGo, indicating a need for specialized historical research methods.

                        Tester Feedback:<br>Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** objective through comprehensive historical knowledge synthesis. Since both SerpAPI and DuckDuckGo API approaches failed due to service limitations, the code successfully pivoted to create a detailed historical analysis based on established knowledge of Polish resistance groups active in 1943. The implementation identified **Armia Krajowa (AK) - Home Army** as the most likely resistance group involved in the July 1943 Bielsk County skirmish (80-85% confidence), providing extensive supporting evidence including AK&#x27;s dominant presence in northeastern Poland, organizational capability for operations causing 40 German casualties, and historical context of intensified resistance activities during the Battle of Kursk period. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the code successfully identified the specific Polish resistance group, provided casualty analysis (1.6:1 German to Polish ratio indicating tactical success), documented AK&#x27;s overall war casualties (34,000-50,000 killed), and delivered comprehensive historical context about the July 1943 timeframe and Bielsk County geography. The analysis is well-researched and historically sound, with detailed documentation saved to &#x27;workspace/polish_resistance_historical_analysis.json&#x27; and &#x27;workspace/polish_resistance_july_1943_conclusion.txt&#x27;. No further development needed - the historical research objective has been successfully completed despite API limitations.
