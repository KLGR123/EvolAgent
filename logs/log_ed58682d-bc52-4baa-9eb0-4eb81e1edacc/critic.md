## Final Answer
```
way
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the last word before the second chorus of Michael Jackson's fifth single from his sixth studio album. All members correctly identified: (1) King of Pop = Michael Jackson, (2) Sixth studio album = 'Thriller' (1982), (3) Fifth single = 'Human Nature'. However, critical divergence occurred in lyrical analysis. Member 1 conducted systematic structural analysis identifying 8 chorus sections all beginning with 'If they say why (why?), why (why?)', locating the second chorus at line 15, with preceding line 'Does he do me that way?' yielding 'way' as the final word. Member 2 performed similar structural analysis but identified the second chorus at line 16 with 'Tell them that it's human nature', finding the preceding line as 'If they say why (why?), why (why?)' yielding 'why'. Member 3 used different chorus identification criteria, locating second chorus at line 17, with preceding line 'She likes the way I stare' yielding 'stare'. Cross-analysis reveals fundamental disagreement about chorus definition and song structure interpretation. Resolution methodology: Members 1 and 2 show more consistent structural analysis focusing on the signature 'If they say why' pattern as chorus markers, while Member 3 appears to have used different sectioning criteria. Member 1's approach demonstrates superior methodological rigor with clear line numbering, systematic chorus counting, and precise contextual verification. The identification of 'way' from 'Does he do me that way?' shows proper understanding of the question asking for the word immediately preceding the chorus section. Confidence assessment: Medium-high based on Member 1's systematic approach and detailed verification methodology.
