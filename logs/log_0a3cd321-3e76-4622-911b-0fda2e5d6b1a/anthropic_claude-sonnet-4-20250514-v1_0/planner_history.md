Focus on identifying countries that maintained gross savings above 35% of GDP consistently for every single year in this decade. Use official World Bank databases, data portals, or reliable sources that provide comprehensive historical economic indicators for this specific time period.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to access World Bank economic data specifically for gross savings as percentage of GDP from 2001-2010, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this topic, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain comprehensive data showing which countries consistently exceeded the 35% threshold across all years in the specified period, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK requirement to identify countries meeting the specific World Bank gross savings criteria for the entire decade.',

    "description": "The PLAN has been completed successfully. The analysis has identified 6 countries/regions that maintained gross savings above 35% of GDP consistently for every single year from 2001-2010 using official World Bank data:\n\n1. **Brunei Darussalam** - Average: 59.98% (Range: 51.79% - 69.49%)\n2. **China** - Average: 45.83% (Range: 37.08% - 51.27%)\n3. **Singapore** - Average: 43.91% (Range: 38.43% - 50.59%)\n4. **East Asia & Pacific (excluding high income)** - Average: 43.19% (Range: 35.77% - 48.00%)\n5. **East Asia & Pacific (IDA & IBRD countries)** - Average: 43.19% (Range: 35.77% - 48.00%)\n6. **Morocco** - Average: 38.45% (Range: 35.04% - 40.19%)\n\nThe analysis was conducted using the World Bank's official API with indicator code NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS (Gross savings % of GDP). Out of 154 countries/regions with complete data coverage for the 2001-2010 period, only these 6 entities maintained the >35% threshold for all 10 consecutive years. \n\nKey deliverables completed:\n- Successfully accessed World Bank's official database via API\n- Retrieved comprehensive gross savings data for 2001-2010 period\n- Processed 1,826 records covering 203 countries/regions\n- Filtered for complete data coverage (154 countries with all 10 years)\n- Applied strict >35% threshold consistently across all years\n- Generated detailed year-by-year breakdowns for qualifying countries\n- Saved comprehensive results to 'workspace/worldbank_consistent_high_savers_2001_2010.json'\n\nThe PLAN objective has been fully achieved with official World Bank data providing the definitive answer to which countries maintained gross savings above 35% of GDP consistently throughout the entire 2001-2010 decade.",

    "description": "This step is necessary because: (1) The developer successfully identified 6 entities that met the criteria, but 2 of them are regional groupings ('East Asia & Pacific' categories) rather than individual countries, (2) The TASK specifically asks for countries, not regional groupings, so we need to filter to only individual nations, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the 4 individual countries (Brunei Darussalam, China, Singapore, Morocco) and format them using common English names in alphabetical order, (4) This provides the final answer format required by the TASK.",
