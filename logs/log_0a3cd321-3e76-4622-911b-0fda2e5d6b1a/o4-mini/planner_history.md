## Execution History

{
    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": 'Retrieve gross savings as a percentage of GDP (indicator NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS) for all countries for each year from 2001 through 2010 using the World Bank API, then filter the dataset to identify countries whose gross savings value exceeds 35% for every year in that period, extract their English country names, sort them alphabetically, and prepare a comma-separated list.',
    "description": 'This plan is optimal because it directly gathers the required time‐series data from the authoritative World Bank source for indicator NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS over the exact years 2001–2010, applies the >35% filter across all years in a single pass, and produces the final alphabetical list of countries, thereby fulfilling the TASK in one coherent step.',

    "description": 'All PLAN objectives have been satisfied and verified by the tester:\n\n1) Data for indicator NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS (gross savings % of GDP) from 2001–2010 was fetched via the World Bank API.\n2) Regional aggregates and non-sovereign entities were excluded by enforcing ISO-2 country codes.\n3) Only countries with values exceeding 35% for every year in the period were retained.\n4) Four sovereign countries qualified: Brunei Darussalam, China, Morocco, and Singapore.\n5) The final list was sorted alphabetically and written as a comma-separated string.\n6) The output was saved to workspace/high_savings_countries.txt and printed to the console.\n\nNo further development is required.',

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. According to the World Bank indicator NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS for the period 2001–2010, the countries with gross savings consistently above 35% of GDP are Brunei, China, Morocco, Singapore. Final answer in alphabetical order: Brunei, China, Morocco, Singapore.',
