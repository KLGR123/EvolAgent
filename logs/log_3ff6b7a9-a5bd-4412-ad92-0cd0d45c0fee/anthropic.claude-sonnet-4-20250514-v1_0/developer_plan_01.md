## Plan Content
```
Search for information about the longest-lived vertebrate to identify which species it is and determine which island it is named after. Focus on finding reliable sources that establish the connection between the longest-lived vertebrate species and its island namesake.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the longest-lived vertebrate species before we can determine which island it's named after, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to establish the species identity and its connection to an island name, (4) This provides the foundation needed to then search for the island's 2020 population data from Wikipedia as of January 1, 2021
