## Task Description
```
You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.

You travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.

In the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: "How many vampires are living in Șirnea". Everyone in the village gives the same response, "At least one of us is a human."

How many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?

### Determining a no-backtracking closed walk through all Earl Smith’s plots in the spreadsheet

**TASK**: Each cell in the attached spreadsheet represents a plot of land. The color of the cell indicates who owns that plot. Green cells are plots owned by Earl Smith. Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking? For this question, consider backtracking to be any instance where Earl would enter a plot of land he had already entered since leaving his starting plot.

Verified the graph is connected (essential prerequisite for Hamiltonian cycle possibility).\n\n3. **Hamiltonian Cycle Detection (✅ Complete)**: Implemented backtracking algorithm that systematically explored all possible paths through Earl's connected land area. The algorithm completed efficiently in 0.050 seconds and definitively determined that no Hamiltonian cycle exists.\n\n**Technical Results:**\n- Graph structure: 49 nodes, 58 edges, average degree 2.37\n- Graph connectivity: CONNECTED (necessary condition met)\n- Hamiltonian cycle: DOES NOT EXIST (sufficient condition failed)\n- Algorithm: Backtracking with complete path exploration\n- Computation time: 0.050 seconds\n\n**Practical Implications for Earl:**\nEarl's desired walking route is mathematically impossible given his land layout. The adjacency constraints of his 49 plots do not permit a path that visits each plot exactly once and returns to the starting point. Earl would need to either:\n- Accept visiting some plots more than once during his walk, or\n- Accept not returning to his starting plot (pursue a Hamiltonian path instead of cycle)\n\n**Output Files Created:**\n- `workspace/earl_hamiltonian_graph.json`: Complete graph structure and adjacency data\n- `workspace/hamiltonian_cycle_results.json`: Detailed algorithm results and conclusions\n\nThe graph theory analysis is complete and the Hamiltonian path problem has been definitively solved. No further algorithmic analysis is required.",

### Find minimum cell towers to cover all houses within 4-mile road radius.

**TASK**: You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. In the reference file is a layout of the road and nearby houses. Each dash, "-", is a marker indicating a mile. Each capital H indicates a house located next to a mile marker, appearing above or below the stretch of road. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt

    "description": "This is a classic logic puzzle that can be solved through logical deduction without requiring external research or computation. Let me analyze the scenario: (1) All 100 residents give the same answer: 'At least one of us is a human', (2) We know humans always tell the truth and vampires always lie, (3) If any humans exist in the village, then the statement 'At least one of us is a human' would be true, and humans would say it truthfully, (4) However, if vampires also say this same statement, they must be lying (since vampires always lie), which means the statement must be false, (5) For the statement to be false, there would need to be zero humans in the village, (6) But this creates a contradiction - if there are no humans, then vampires saying 'At least one of us is a human' would be telling the truth, which vampires cannot do, (7) The only logical resolution is that there must be exactly 99 vampires and 1 human - the human tells the truth about at least one human existing, while the 99 vampires lie by claiming the same thing (their lie being that they are implying they themselves might be the human). Final answer: 99 residents have been turned into vampires.",
