# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for Tri-Rail passenger ridership data and train schedules for May 27, 2019. Focus on finding official Tri-Rail documentation, ridership reports, or transit data that shows passenger counts by individual train on that specific date. Also locate the corresponding train schedules to identify arrival times at Pompano Beach station for the trains operating on May 27, 2019.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify which specific Tri-Rail train carried the most passengers on May 27, 2019, which requires accessing ridership data for that date, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this transit system or date, (3) Expected outcome is to find official Tri-Rail passenger data and schedule information that will allow us to determine both the highest-ridership train and its scheduled Pompano Beach arrival time, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement to find the specific train with maximum passengers and its arrival time at Pompano Beach station

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Identify All MBTA Franklin-Foxboro Line Stops from South Station to Windsor Gardens (May 2023)

**Description**: Search for current MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line information as of May 2023 to identify all stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens. Focus on finding official MBTA route maps, schedules, or station listings that show the complete sequence of stations on the Franklin-Foxboro line during that time period.

**Use Cases**:
- Transportation planning for a local government agency assessing commuter rail accessibility between Boston and suburban communities in May 2023
- Real estate market analysis to identify properties within walking distance of Franklin-Foxboro line stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens
- Mobile app development for a transit navigation tool that displays all MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line stops and route details for riders
- Academic research on public transit usage patterns, requiring accurate stop sequences for survey design and data collection
- Automated schedule update system for a university shuttle service that coordinates with MBTA train arrivals at Windsor Gardens
- Travel agency itinerary planning for group tours, ensuring all relevant train stops are included between Boston and Windsor Gardens
- Emergency response route mapping for first responders needing precise station locations along the Franklin-Foxboro line
- Accessibility audit by a disability advocacy organization to evaluate station features and platform information between South Station and Windsor Gardens

### Development Step 3: Count Intermediate Stops Between South Station and Windsor Gardens on MBTA Franklin-Foxboro Line Using API Data

**Description**: Count the intermediate stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens on the MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line using the comprehensive station data already retrieved. Extract the exact number of stops that fall between these two endpoints (not including South Station and Windsor Gardens themselves) from the processed MBTA API data in the workspace files.

**Use Cases**:
- MBTA commuter rail schedule optimization for transit planners assessing passenger flow between major endpoints
- Real estate market analysis for agents highlighting properties with direct access to intermediate stops on the Franklin-Foxboro line
- Automated travel itinerary generation for tour operators planning group excursions with stop-by-stop breakdowns
- Emergency response route planning for municipal agencies needing precise intermediate station locations for evacuation scenarios
- Accessibility audits for advocacy groups evaluating the number and distribution of stops with ADA-compliant facilities between South Station and Windsor Gardens
- Data-driven marketing campaigns for local businesses targeting commuters at specific intermediate stations
- Academic transportation studies analyzing ridership patterns and station usage between urban and suburban endpoints
- Mobile app development for commuters providing real-time alerts and notifications for intermediate stops along the MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line

### Development Step 7: Investigate July 1962 Train Derailment Near Dijon: Identify Incident, Route, and Destination

**Description**: Search for information about a train derailment that occurred in July 1962 near Dijon, France (Gustave Eiffel's birthplace). Focus on identifying the specific train derailment incident, the train's route, and most importantly its intended destination. Use search terms including 'July 1962 train derailment Dijon France', 'train accident July 1962 near Dijon', '1962 railway accident Dijon region', and 'July 1962 French train derailment destination'.

**Use Cases**:
- Railway safety regulator performing automated extraction of historical derailment details to update national safety guidelines and risk models
- Legal research assistant compiling verified accident testimonies and route destination facts for personal injury litigation support in July 1962 Dijon train crash claims
- Museum exhibit developer aggregating multimedia snippets and timeline data for an interactive display on mid-20th century French railway disasters
- Academic historian conducting cross-referenced search queries to analyze 1962 SNCF accident patterns for a peer-reviewed transport safety study
- Insurance claim processing automation retrieving official accident reports and casualty figures to streamline compensation assessments for families of passengers
- Urban planner integrating geocoded train derailment records with GIS to model corridor vulnerabilities and plan infrastructure reinforcements in the Burgundy region
- Journalism team performing deep-dive research with targeted query strategies to uncover untold narratives and destination milestones for a documentary on Europe’s rail heritage
