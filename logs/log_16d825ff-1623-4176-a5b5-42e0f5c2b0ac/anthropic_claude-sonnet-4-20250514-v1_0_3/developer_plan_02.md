# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Contact the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA) directly to request the May 2019 operations report or specific data for Memorial Day (May 27, 2019). Request individual train ridership data and Pompano Beach arrival times for that date. Use phone number (954) 788-7925 or attempt to find alternative contact methods through their official website. If direct contact is not feasible, search for archived transit data from third-party sources, news reports about Memorial Day 2019 Tri-Rail service, or academic transportation databases that might have preserved this historical ridership information.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The comprehensive search confirmed that Tri-Rail operations reports contain the exact data structure needed (individual train passenger counts and Pompano Beach station data), but the May 2019 report is not publicly accessible online, (2) Previous research established the data format from March/April 2019 reports and confirmed May 27, 2019 was Memorial Day with expected reduced ridership, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the specific May 27, 2019 ridership data by train and Pompano Beach arrival times through official channels, (4) This direct approach targets the authoritative source that would have the precise information needed to identify which train carried the most passengers and its scheduled Pompano Beach arrival time

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Identify All MBTA Franklin-Foxboro Line Stops from South Station to Windsor Gardens (May 2023)

**Description**: Search for current MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line information as of May 2023 to identify all stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens. Focus on finding official MBTA route maps, schedules, or station listings that show the complete sequence of stations on the Franklin-Foxboro line during that time period.

**Use Cases**:
- Transportation planning for a local government agency assessing commuter rail accessibility between Boston and suburban communities in May 2023
- Real estate market analysis to identify properties within walking distance of Franklin-Foxboro line stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens
- Mobile app development for a transit navigation tool that displays all MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line stops and route details for riders
- Academic research on public transit usage patterns, requiring accurate stop sequences for survey design and data collection
- Automated schedule update system for a university shuttle service that coordinates with MBTA train arrivals at Windsor Gardens
- Travel agency itinerary planning for group tours, ensuring all relevant train stops are included between Boston and Windsor Gardens
- Emergency response route mapping for first responders needing precise station locations along the Franklin-Foxboro line
- Accessibility audit by a disability advocacy organization to evaluate station features and platform information between South Station and Windsor Gardens

### Development Step 3: Count Intermediate Stops Between South Station and Windsor Gardens on MBTA Franklin-Foxboro Line Using API Data

**Description**: Count the intermediate stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens on the MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line using the comprehensive station data already retrieved. Extract the exact number of stops that fall between these two endpoints (not including South Station and Windsor Gardens themselves) from the processed MBTA API data in the workspace files.

**Use Cases**:
- MBTA commuter rail schedule optimization for transit planners assessing passenger flow between major endpoints
- Real estate market analysis for agents highlighting properties with direct access to intermediate stops on the Franklin-Foxboro line
- Automated travel itinerary generation for tour operators planning group excursions with stop-by-stop breakdowns
- Emergency response route planning for municipal agencies needing precise intermediate station locations for evacuation scenarios
- Accessibility audits for advocacy groups evaluating the number and distribution of stops with ADA-compliant facilities between South Station and Windsor Gardens
- Data-driven marketing campaigns for local businesses targeting commuters at specific intermediate stations
- Academic transportation studies analyzing ridership patterns and station usage between urban and suburban endpoints
- Mobile app development for commuters providing real-time alerts and notifications for intermediate stops along the MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line
