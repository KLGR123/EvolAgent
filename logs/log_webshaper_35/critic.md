## Final Answer
```
Asian Financial Crisis
```

## True Answer
```
The Asian financial crisis
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the specific economic event that China faced in 1997 which prompted the allocation of 287 billion yuan for major construction projects. All three team members employed identical methodological approaches with comprehensive web search strategies targeting the same keywords and research objectives. Individual evaluation reveals: Member 1 conducted systematic research across 96 search results with 8 targeted queries, identifying 37 results specifically mentioning the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, and provided clear documentation of China's infrastructure stimulus response. Member 2 used the same comprehensive approach, analyzing 96 search results and confirming the Asian Financial Crisis as the triggering event, noting China's estimated 660 billion yuan total stimulus spending through 2002, though acknowledging the specific 287 billion yuan figure wasn't found in 1997 records. Member 3 followed identical methodology, analyzing 96 results across 8 queries with 40 results specifically mentioning the Asian Financial Crisis, providing detailed timeline starting with Thailand's currency peg abandonment in July 1997. Convergence analysis: Perfect agreement across all members on the core identification - the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 as the significant economic event. All members consistently identified the crisis timeline (beginning Thailand July 1997, spreading across Asia), China's infrastructure investment response strategy, and the connection to major construction project funding. Divergence examination: Minor differences only in specific data points and documentation details, with Member 2 providing additional context about total stimulus amounts and Member 3 offering more detailed crisis origin mechanics. No fundamental contradictions identified. Synthesis evaluation: All approaches demonstrated high methodological rigor with identical search strategies and consistent findings from authoritative sources including World Bank, IMF, and Federal Reserve documentation. Final validation: Multiple independent research efforts converging on identical conclusion provides high confidence. The Asian Financial Crisis is definitively established as the 1997 economic event that prompted China's major construction project investments.
