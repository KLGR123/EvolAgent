# Developer Plan #4 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_73  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 4  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-13 00:56:20

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about who elevated Archbishop Jos√© de Jes√∫s Pimiento Rodr√≠guez to the rank of cardinal. Focus on finding records of his cardinalate appointment, including the date of elevation and which Pope made this appointment. Look for Vatican records, biographical sources, and Catholic Church documentation about his promotion to cardinal.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the final step needed to complete the task because: (1) The previous research successfully identified Archbishop Jos√© de Jes√∫s Pimiento Rodr√≠guez as the Archbishop of Manizales who led disaster relief during the 1985 Nevado del Ruiz eruption, and confirmed that Manizales hosts the oldest continuously running theater festival in Latin America (Festival Internacional de Teatro de Manizales), (2) We now need to determine which Pope elevated this Archbishop to cardinal to answer the original question, (3) Expected outcome is to find the papal appointment records showing who made him a cardinal, (4) This will provide the final answer about the name of the person who elevated him to cardinal rank

### Development Step 4: Investigate principal and co-consecrators in Cardinal Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara‚Äôs episcopal consecration.

**Description**: Research Cardinal Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara's episcopal consecration to identify who consecrated him as a bishop and any co-consecrators involved in the ceremony. Focus on finding historical records, biographical sources, and Catholic Church documentation about his appointment and consecration as bishop. Extract the names of all individuals who participated in his consecration ceremony, including the principal consecrator and any co-consecrators required by canon law.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historians compiling a database of Catholic apostolic succession for a peer-reviewed publication on 16th-century episcopal lineages
- Seminary educators creating interactive consecration lineage charts to teach students about apostolic succession and canonical requirements
- Diocesan archivists verifying the principal and co-consecrators of all bishops in church records to ensure compliance with canon law archives
- Biographers extracting precise consecration details of Cardinal Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara to enrich a critical biography of Spanish clerical figures
- Museum curators generating a digital timeline of episcopal appointments and consecrations for a historical exhibit on the Roman Catholic Church
- Data aggregation services automating the ingestion of consecration information to maintain and update the Catholic-Hierarchy.org database
- Canon law consultants validating sacramental ordination legitimacy in tribunal cases by tracing the exact consecrators and co-consecrators involved
- Genealogy researchers mapping ecclesiastical ‚Äúfamily trees‚Äù to explore connections between bishops across centuries and geographic regions

### Development Step 8: Which Consecrator of Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara Never Became Pope?

**Description**: Determine which of the three individuals involved in Cardinal Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara's episcopal consecration never became pope. Research the papal history of: (1) Pope Clement VIII (the principal consecrator), (2) Camillo Cardinal Borghese (co-consecrator), and (3) Alfonso Visconti (co-consecrator). Identify which of these three individuals never achieved papal office and provide that person's name as the final answer.

**Use Cases**:
- Ecclesiastical lineage validation and automated papal-status tagging for digital church archives
- Theological research database cross-checking and JSON report generation for seminarian study portals
- Historical succession analysis and interactive timeline creation for Catholic heritage museums
- Automated data verification and metadata enrichment for Vatican digital library catalogues
- Genealogical network mapping and consecration-chain visualization for religious genealogy services
- Knowledge graph integration and API-driven historical query service for academic historians
- Educational module development and lineage quiz generation for seminary e-learning platforms

### Development Step 6: Determining Which of Cardinal Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara‚Äôs Consecrators Never Became Pope

**Description**: Determine which of the three individuals involved in Cardinal Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara's episcopal consecration never became pope. Research the papal history of: (1) Pope Clement VIII (the principal consecrator), (2) Camillo Cardinal Borghese (co-consecrator), and (3) Alfonso Visconti (co-consecrator). Identify which of these three individuals never achieved papal office and provide that person's name as the final answer.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic church history research automation for dissertations, streamlining primary‚Äêsource discovery on episcopal consecrations and tracking which consecrators became pope
- Digital humanities project enriching Catholic hierarchy databases by programmatically gathering consecration details and papal status of each participating cardinal
- Genealogy platform integrating ecclesiastical lineage tracing, using automated searches to build ancestral profiles of clergy members and their consecrators
- Interactive educational tool for theology students, dynamically populating bishop consecration timelines and papal election data from real‚Äêtime search results
- Editorial fact‚Äêchecking workflow for religious publications, automating verification of consecration ceremonies and the papal advancement of involved cardinals
- Museum exhibit software curating digital displays of papal history, fetching and annotating consecration events and cardinal biographies for interactive kiosks
- Library archival management system enriching rare‚Äêbook metadata by extracting papal history and consecration participations to improve catalog searchability
- Church administration portal tracking episcopal appointments, automatically verifying consecrators‚Äô papal records to maintain accurate diocesan leadership data

### Development Step 7: Which consecrator of Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara never became pope?

**Description**: Determine which of the three individuals involved in Cardinal Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara's episcopal consecration never became pope. Research the papal history of: (1) Pope Clement VIII (the principal consecrator), (2) Camillo Cardinal Borghese (co-consecrator), and (3) Alfonso Visconti (co-consecrator). Identify which of these three individuals never achieved papal office and provide that person's name as the final answer.

**Use Cases**:
- Episcopal lineage mapping and consecrator status verification for digital humanities projects
- Automated validation of consecration records and papal status for Catholic university research databases
- Fact-checking and historical accuracy assessment for religious publishing houses producing church history volumes
- Interactive timeline generation and metadata enrichment for museum exhibits on papal consecrations
- Curriculum content creation and quiz generation on church hierarchy for theological e-learning platforms
- Archival cataloging automation and metadata tagging for Vatican library digitization initiatives
- Genealogical analysis of ecclesiastical family connections and consecrator-papal relationships for historical societies
- Canon law research support and pre-publication review of legal documents referencing episcopal consecrations
