    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed a comprehensive analysis of the anagram text. The script successfully extracted the anagram phrase 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten' from the corrected analysis files, performed detailed letter frequency analysis (100 total letters), and tested 20 famous Shakespeare lines for potential matches. No exact matches were found in the initial test set, which suggests the original line is either less common or has different formatting. The code properly analyzed letter counts and saved detailed results to 'workspace/anagram_analysis_results.json'. **PLAN** alignment: 75% complete - text analysis and initial matching complete, but the actual Shakespeare line has not yet been identified. Next step: Expand the search to include more Shakespeare quotes or try systematic anagram generation approaches to find the original line that matches the letter frequency pattern (E:13, T:14, O:11, N:8, R:8, S:8, etc.).",

    "description": 'Comprehensive Shakespeare anagram analysis implementation to systematically find the original line. This stage focuses on: (1) Safely loading and inspecting previous analysis results from workspace files, (2) Extracting confirmed anagram data including the 100-letter sequence and letter frequency patterns, (3) Testing an expanded database of Shakespeare lines including longer passages and composite quotes that might match the 100-letter count, (4) Implementing similarity scoring for partial matches to identify close candidates, (5) Analyzing letter patterns and common Shakespeare words that can be formed from available letters, (6) Providing manual analysis suggestions focusing on Hamlet-related quotes given the anagram content. The code includes comprehensive error handling, detailed progress reporting, and saves multiple analysis files including perfect matches, partial matches, and next steps recommendations. This systematic approach expands beyond the initial 20 famous quotes to cover longer Shakespeare passages that might be exact anagram matches.',

The comprehensive analysis included letter frequency verification, pattern matching for Hamlet-related words, and systematic comparison with longer Shakespeare passages. The code properly saved detailed results to 'workspace/comprehensive_anagram_analysis.json' and created a summary file. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - thorough analysis conducted and extensive Shakespeare database tested, but the original line remains unidentified.

Here are some approaches to try:\n1. Focus on the fact that it mentions "Hamlet" - likely from Hamlet\n2. Look for the pattern "TO BE OR NOT TO BE" or similar famous Hamlet lines\n3. The phrase "how life turns rotten" might relate to "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark"\n4. Try online anagram solvers with the 100-letter string\n5.

    "description": "Targeted Shakespeare anagram generation implementation focusing on systematic analysis of specific Hamlet quotes. This stage: (1) Safely inspects workspace files to locate and load comprehensive analysis data from previous iterations, (2) Extracts the confirmed 100-letter anagram sequence and letter frequency data, (3) Tests 33 specific Hamlet quotes and soliloquy lines for exact anagram matches, (4) Analyzes combinations of consecutive Hamlet lines to find multi-line anagram solutions, (5) Performs manual verification by checking if key Shakespeare phrases ('TO BE OR NOT TO BE', 'THAT IS THE QUESTION', etc.) can be formed from available letters, (6) Ranks all potential matches by similarity score and confidence level. The code includes comprehensive error handling, detailed progress reporting, and saves targeted analysis results with specific recommendations for next steps. This focused approach moves beyond general Shakespeare quotes to systematically test the most famous Hamlet passages that could be anagram sources.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and performed a focused analysis specifically targeting Hamlet quotes and combinations. The script successfully loaded previous analysis data, extracted the 100-letter sequence, and tested 33 individual Hamlet quotes plus consecutive line combinations. Found one high similarity combination (98.0%) with 'To be or not to be that is the question Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer...' but no perfect anagram matches. The analysis confirmed that common Shakespeare phrases like 'TO BE OR NOT TO BE' and 'THAT IS THE QUESTION' can be formed from the available letters. **PLAN** alignment: 90% complete - comprehensive targeted analysis conducted with focus on Hamlet as suggested by the anagram content, but the exact original line still requires identification. The code properly saved targeted analysis results and created recommendation files. The 100-letter string analysis is thorough, but the solution may require external anagram solving tools or access to less common Shakespeare lines not in the current database.

    "description": "Systematic anagram solving implementation using comprehensive pattern matching and verification techniques. This final stage: (1) Safely inspects and loads the latest targeted analysis data from workspace files to extract confirmed anagram information, (2) Performs systematic word pattern analysis using common Shakespeare vocabulary to identify formable words from the 100-letter sequence, (3) Tests the absolute most famous Shakespeare quotes of all time, including extended versions that might match the 100-letter count, (4) Manually verifies the complete Hamlet 'To be or not to be' soliloquy as the most likely candidate based on HISTORY analysis, (5) Implements rigorous letter frequency comparison and similarity scoring for all potential matches, (6) Creates comprehensive final answer files with either the perfect solution or recommendations for external anagram solving tools. This approach combines all previous analysis insights with systematic verification to either identify the original Shakespeare line or provide definitive guidance for solving the anagram puzzle.",

The error occurred in the workspace inspection loop where the code expects 2 values (name, path) but the workspace_files list contains tuples with 3 values (name, path, file_size). **PLAN** alignment: 0% - code failed before any anagram analysis could begin. The systematic approach is sound but needs a simple fix to handle the tuple structure correctly. Recommended fix: Update the loop on line 35 to unpack 3 values instead of 2: 'for file_name, file_path, file_size in workspace_files:' or use indexing to access only the needed values. Once this syntax error is resolved, the comprehensive Shakespeare analysis logic appears well-structured to continue the anagram solving process.",

This implementation: (1) Fixes the ValueError by properly unpacking 3 values (file_name, file_path, file_size) from workspace_files tuples, (2) Safely inspects and loads the latest analysis data from workspace JSON files, (3) Extracts the confirmed 100-letter anagram sequence from previous analysis or uses fallback from HISTORY, (4) Tests 26 extended Shakespeare passages focusing on longer quotes that could match the 100-letter count, (5) Specifically tests 6 Hamlet soliloquy variations as the most likely candidates, (6) Implements rigorous letter frequency comparison and similarity scoring for all potential matches, (7) Creates comprehensive final answer files with either perfect solutions or detailed recommendations for external anagram solving tools. This approach combines all previous insights with systematic verification to definitively solve the professor's anagram challenge or provide clear guidance for students.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and conducted the most comprehensive Shakespeare anagram analysis yet. The script successfully loaded previous analysis data, extracted the confirmed 100-letter anagram sequence 'INONEOFTHEBARDSBESTTHOUGHTOFTRAGEDIESAREINSISTENTHEROHAMLETQUERIESONTWOFRONTSABOUTHOWLIFETURNSROTTEN', and tested an extensive database of Shakespeare quotes including 26 extended passages. Found one high-similarity match (98%) with 'To be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune' but no perfect anagram matches. The analysis confirmed that key Shakespeare phrases can be formed from available letters and tested both individual quotes and extended Hamlet soliloquy variations. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - exhaustive systematic analysis conducted but the exact original line remains unidentified. The code properly saved comprehensive results and created definitive answer files. The 100-letter sequence has been thoroughly analyzed against Shakespeare's most famous works. Final recommendation: Students should use external anagram solving tools (anagram-solver.net, wordplays.com) with the confirmed sequence, as the solution likely requires computational anagram generation beyond manual database matching.",

Tested 46 formable Shakespeare words, verified key phrases like 'TO BE OR NOT TO BE' and 'THAT IS THE QUESTION' can be formed from available letters, and found one 98% similarity match with the famous Hamlet soliloquy.
