The professor's question is clear: find the original Shakespeare line that is an anagram of the given phrase, with an automatic A on the quiz as reward. All necessary files have been saved to workspace for future reference. No further development is needed.",

    "description": "The PLAN has been successfully completed based on the HISTORY feedback. The audio file data/gaia/2023/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3 has been fully analyzed and the professor's anagram question has been correctly identified. The tester confirmed that the task is 100% complete with all objectives met: (1) Audio extraction and transcription was successful using Google Speech Recognition, (2) The professor's spoken question was clearly transcribed, revealing a Shakespeare anagram puzzle, (3) The specific text that needs to be rearranged into an anagram has been correctly identified as 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten', (4) The professor's instructions are clear - students need to find the original Shakespeare line that is an anagram of this phrase to earn an automatic A on next week's quiz. All analysis files have been properly saved to workspace including the corrected analysis JSON, final summary text file, and transcription file. The initial pattern matching error was successfully corrected in the second iteration, and the tester confirmed no further development is needed. The professor's anagram question has been fully extracted and documented.",
