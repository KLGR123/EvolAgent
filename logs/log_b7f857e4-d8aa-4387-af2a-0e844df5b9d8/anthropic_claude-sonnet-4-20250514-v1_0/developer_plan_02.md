# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Fix the array bounds errors in the extracted Python script workspace/complete_python_script.py by adjusting the url_indices array to use valid indices, then execute the corrected script against the provided string array to generate the URL containing C++ source code.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The previous analysis identified that the Python script has array bounds errors that prevent execution, (2) We have the complete script extracted but need to fix the IndexError issues before running it, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain a working URL that contains C++ source code, (4) This addresses the core requirement of running the Python script against the provided array to get the C++ code URL

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Parse and analyze Python script to understand logic and compute its final numeric result.

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Python code file data/gaia/2023/validation/f918266a-b3e0-4914-865d-4faa564f1aef.py to understand its structure and logic. Read the complete code content, identify the main execution flow, trace through any calculations or operations, and determine what the final numeric output will be when this code is executed.

**Use Cases**:
- Regulatory compliance audit of Python-based trading algorithms by analyzing code structure, dependencies, and operations for financial institutions
- Automated pre-merge code review in a DevOps CI/CD pipeline to detect unauthorized imports and enforce coding standards for enterprise software teams
- Generation of summary reports on data processing scripts in a bioinformatics research lab to validate function usage, mathematical operations, and workflow consistency
- Static analysis of configuration and orchestration scripts in cloud infrastructure repositories to identify potential security vulnerabilities and resource misconfigurations
- Automated grading and feedback for computer science students by parsing submitted Python assignments, checking for required functions, loops, and print statements
- Quality assurance for educational content platforms by scanning tutorial code examples to ensure consistency, presence of docstrings, and accurate execution flow descriptions
- Code migration and refactoring planning for legacy systems by inventorying existing Python modules, mapping variable assignments and control structures, and estimating complexity
- Documentation generation for an open-source machine learning library by extracting function and class definitions, usage examples, and operation details from source files

### Development Step 2: Analyze Python code file to understand logic, trace execution, and find its final numeric output.

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Python code file data/gaia/2023/validation/f918266a-b3e0-4914-865d-4faa564f1aef.py to understand its structure and logic. Read the complete code content, identify the main execution flow, trace through any calculations or operations, and determine what the final numeric output will be when this code is executed.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated security auditing of financial services Python scripts to detect unexpected exception paths and harmful random value usages before deployment
- Integration into a CI/CD pipeline for e-commerce microservices to trace code flow changes and prevent regressions in discount calculation logic
- Pre-release validation of healthcare analytics tools, ensuring that data sampling routines (randomized values) meet compliance criteria and don’t silently fail
- Educational platform feature that step-by-step parses student-submitted Python assignments, highlighting execution flow and exception handling for teaching programming concepts
- Quality assurance automation in IoT firmware code, analyzing logic paths that generate sensor threshold alerts to catch misconfigurations early
- Documentation generator for enterprise DevOps teams that reads source files, maps function and class structures, and produces human-readable execution overviews
- Research lab tool to validate stochastic simulation scripts by tracing random number generation criteria and logging first valid outcomes for reproducibility
- Government software compliance verifier that parses public sector codebases, traces exception-raising conditions, and produces audit-ready reports of code logic paths

### Development Step 7: Search 2011 Bulgarian Census Data on Tertiary Education Completion by Gender

**Description**: Search for the 2011 Bulgarian census data on tertiary education completion by gender. Look for official census results from Bulgaria's National Statistical Institute or other authoritative sources that provide the specific breakdown of men and women who completed tertiary education in 2011.

**Use Cases**:
- A policy analyst at Bulgaria’s Ministry of Education automates extraction of 2011 tertiary completion rates by gender from archived NSI HTML dumps to inform a gender equity report.
- A university demographer uses the script to parse archived census web pages and integrate the 2011 tertiary education gender breakdown into a longitudinal study on educational attainment trends.
- An NGO designing STEM outreach programs in underprivileged Bulgarian regions extracts male and female university completion percentages from 2011 census HTML files to target communities with low female enrollment.
- A market intelligence team at an e-learning startup crawls and parses historical Bulgarian census education data for gender‐specific tertiary completion to tailor course offerings and marketing strategies.
- A data journalist investigating gender disparities in Eastern Europe automates scraping of official Bulgarian census tables to quickly gather tertiary education statistics by gender for a data-driven article.
- A data scientist at an international organization uses the Python scraper to collect and standardize gender-disaggregated tertiary education rates from Bulgarian census HTML archives for cross-country comparative analyses.
- An urban planner compiles educational attainment profiles by gender for Bulgarian municipalities by extracting and mapping 2011 census tertiary completion data to support regional development proposals.
- A human resources consultancy benchmarks workforce education levels by downloading and parsing national census HTML data to compare male and female tertiary degree completion across Bulgarian industries.

### Development Step 4: Extract 11th Move Cell Hex Color via BFS on Two-Cell Move Adjacency Graph

**Description**: Construct adjacency graph of legal two-cell moves using workspace/grid_data.json and workspace/start_end_coordinates.json and perform a breadth-first search from the START cell to locate the shortest path to the END cell enforcing no immediate backtracking; identify the coordinate of the cell landed on after the 11th move along the resulting path; extract that cell’s 6-digit hex fill color from workspace/grid_data.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Autonomous warehouse navigation and pallet pickup route optimization for robotic forklifts
- Precision agriculture path planning and segment-specific soil analysis for automated tractors
- Urban package delivery drone routing and mid-route risk assessment for last-mile logistics
- Hospital floor evacuation mapping and staging area identification for emergency response teams
- Interactive museum exhibit routing and multimedia trigger sequencing for guided tours
- Board game AI move sequence analysis and power-up activation for strategic game design
- Video game level path verification and environmental tile consistency checking for QA testing
