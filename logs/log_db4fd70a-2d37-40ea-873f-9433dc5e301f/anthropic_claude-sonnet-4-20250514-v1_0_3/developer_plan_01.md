# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for current MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line route information as of May 2023. Locate the official MBTA system map, schedule, or route guide that shows all station stops on the Franklin-Foxboro line. Identify the positions of South Station and Windsor Gardens stations, then count the intermediate stops between these two stations (excluding both South Station and Windsor Gardens from the count).

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to access current MBTA route information to identify all stops on the Franklin-Foxboro line as of May 2023, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this transit system, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the official station list and route map showing the sequence of stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement to count intermediate stops on the specific MBTA line during the specified timeframe.

## Episodic Examples

### Development Step 22: BFS on Grid to Get 11th Two-Cell Move Landing Cell’s Hex Color

**Description**: Perform a breadth-first search on workspace/adjacency_cardinal.json starting from the START coordinate from workspace/start_end_coordinates.json to find the shortest path to the END coordinate; then identify the coordinate at index 11 in the resulting path (representing the landing cell after the eleventh two-cell move) and retrieve its 6-digit hex fill_color from workspace/grid_data.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Indoor warehouse robot path planning to retrieve inventory: performing BFS on the facility grid to find the shortest route and then extracting the 11th landing cell’s color-coded zone for optimized pick-up scheduling
- Emergency evacuation route mapping in a high-rise building: running BFS from each floor’s stairwell to the ground exit, then identifying the 11th corridor segment’s safety-zone color for dynamic signage updates
- Automated agricultural drone flight planning: computing the BFS route across a crop-field grid to systematically survey plants, then retrieving the 11th waypoint’s soil-type color classification to adjust sensor calibration
- Facility maintenance scheduling in a chemical plant: finding the shortest inspection path through pipe junctions via BFS and extracting the 11th segment’s hazard-level color code to prioritize safety checks
- Theme-park visitor guidance: calculating the BFS walking path between attractions on a park map, then highlighting the 11th tile’s themed-zone color in the mobile app for targeted promotions
- Data-center cabling optimization: using BFS on rack adjacency graphs to plan cable runs from core switches to servers, then extracting the 11th rack’s zone color to avoid thermal hotspots
- Urban drone delivery route planning: executing BFS on a city grid to determine optimal flight paths, then retrieving the 11th waypoint’s airspace-classification color for compliance with local regulations

### Development Step 20: BFS Shortest Path and Retrieve 11th Move Landing Cell Hex Color

**Use Cases**:
- Autonomous warehouse robotics navigation: compute the shortest route between loading dock and packing station, identify the robot’s 11th waypoint, and retrieve its floor tile color code from the facility grid for dynamic route marking.
- Agricultural drone sampling: plan a grid-based flight path from field entry to exit, find the 11th GPS coordinate in the optimal route, and fetch its soil-type hex color from GIS data to trigger targeted soil analysis.
- Interactive museum guide system: map visitor flow across exhibit rooms, determine the 11th room on the shortest path from the entrance to the special exhibit, and pull its exhibit-theme color for on-screen wayfinding cues.
- Video game level design QA: verify the NPC’s path through a dungeon from spawn to exit, locate the 11th room in the BFS-computed path, and extract the room’s background hex color from level metadata for visual consistency checks.
- Emergency evacuation planning: simulate the quickest escape route in a building floorplan, identify the 11th corridor segment on the BFS path, and retrieve its wall-paint color code to validate visibility under smoke conditions.
- Urban pedestrian flow analysis: model the shortest walking route between two city squares, pick the 11th intersection in that path, and obtain its land-use zoning color from the city grid to assess commercial vs. residential foot traffic.
- Environmental field research: chart the most direct transect across a habitat grid, select the 11th survey point, and look up its vegetation-cover hex color from satellite grid data for biodiversity sampling.
