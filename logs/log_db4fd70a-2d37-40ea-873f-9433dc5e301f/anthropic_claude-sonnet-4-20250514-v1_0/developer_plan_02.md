# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Count the intermediate stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens on the MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line using the comprehensive station data already retrieved. Extract the exact number of stops that fall between these two endpoints (not including South Station and Windsor Gardens themselves) from the processed MBTA API data in the workspace files.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The developer successfully retrieved complete MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line data with all 17 stops identified and their sequence established, (2) Both South Station and Windsor Gardens have been located in the station sequence, (3) Expected outcome is to count only the intermediate stops between these endpoints, excluding the endpoints themselves as specified in the TASK, (4) This will provide the exact answer by filtering the comprehensive station list to count only the stops that fall between South Station and Windsor Gardens on the Franklin-Foxboro line.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 25: Comma-Delimited Cities of Westernmost Santa Clara and Easternmost UMass Boston Universities

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- Recruitment travel route optimization for university admissions teams planning coast-to-coast campus tours starting in Santa Clara and ending in Boston
- National shipping schedule automation for educational material distribution services calculating pickup at the westernmost point (Santa Clara) and drop-off at the easternmost point (Boston)
- Comparative educational research analyzing enrollment trends by using the westernmost and easternmost universities as geographic benchmarks for west-to-east cross-sectional studies
- GIS data validation workflows in campus mapping systems verifying that Santa Clara University and UMass Boston coordinates are correctly represented at the extremes of the dataset
- Marketing segmentation for online learning platforms targeting students at the farthest west and east locations to measure regional engagement differences
- Logistics planning for national academic conference organizers scheduling equipment delivery from the west coast (Santa Clara) to the east coast (Boston)
- Vendor contract negotiations for campus services demonstrating coverage from the westernmost to the easternmost university to secure nationwide service agreements
- Emergency response drill coordination for university networks simulating communication and support between the coast-to-coast endpoints at Santa Clara University and UMass Boston
