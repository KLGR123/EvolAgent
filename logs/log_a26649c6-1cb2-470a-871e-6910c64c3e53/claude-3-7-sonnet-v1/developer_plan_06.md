## Plan Content
```
Recalculate the absolute difference in tens of thousands between the chinstrap penguin population figures based on all verified information in the HISTORY. Use the confirmed values of 8 million penguins from Wikipedia (2018) and 3.42 million breeding pairs from Nature.com (2020), converting breeding pairs to total penguins by multiplying by 2 as specified.
```

## Plan Description
```
This final calculation is necessary because: (1) We have confirmed the Wikipedia 2018 estimate is 8 million penguins and the Nature.com 2020 figure is 3.42 million breeding pairs, (2) There were inconsistencies in previous calculations that need resolution for an accurate final answer, (3) Expected outcome is to perform the calculation with verified figures: 8 million - (3.42 million pairs Ã— 2 penguins/pair) = absolute difference, then divide by 10,000 to express in tens of thousands, (4) This will provide the precise answer to the original TASK using only verified data points.
