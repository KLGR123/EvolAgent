Task decomposition: Calculate absolute difference between chinstrap penguin populations from two sources, expressed in tens of thousands. First data point: Wikipedia (2018) population - all three team members independently verified 8 million individual penguins from IUCN assessment on Wikipedia. Second data point: Nature.com 2020 study - all members confirmed 3.42 million breeding pairs in the global population assessment article. Converting breeding pairs to individuals requires multiplying by 2 penguins per breeding pair as specified in the task: 3.42 million ร 2 = 6.84 million individual penguins. Calculating absolute difference: |8,000,000 - 6,840,000| = 1,160,000 penguins. Converting to tens of thousands: 1,160,000 รท 10,000 = 116 tens of thousands. No divergence in methodology or results was observed among team members. Each member followed appropriate research steps, located the correct source documents, extracted the precise population figures, applied the specified conversion factor, and calculated the difference using proper mathematical operations. Final validation confirms high confidence in the answer with triple independent verification producing identical results.
