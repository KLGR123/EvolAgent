  "reason": "1) Task decomposition and success criteria: The task requires parsing the Excel file, extracting vendor monthly revenue, rent, and type, computing the revenue-to-rent ratio for each vendor, identifying the vendor with the lowest ratio, and returning that vendor’s type. 2) Individual evaluation: All three members independently parsed the file, calculated ratios, and identified Carnivore Loan Specialists as the lowest-ratio vendor (ratio ≈ 0.6162), with type “Finance.” Member 1 provided comprehensive results and summary statistics but did not explicitly validate data completeness. Member 3 correctly mirrored that analysis with clear ratio calculations. Member 2, however, added rigorous data-quality checks (header detection, normalization, missing-value and non-numeric validation, zero-rent handling) before computing ratios. 3) Cross-analysis: All members converged on the same vendor and type, confirming correctness; no contradictions were found. 4) Synthesis: Given unanimous agreement and Member 2’s methodological rigor, we select “Finance” as the definitive type. 5) Validation: Independent recalculations and mutual confirmation across three approaches affirm the result’s accuracy. 6) Confidence: High, due to consistent conclusions and robust data-quality controls.",
