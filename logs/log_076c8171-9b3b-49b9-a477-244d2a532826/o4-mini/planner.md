## Task Description
```
The attached file contains a list of vendors in the Liminal Springs mall, along with each vendor’s monthly revenue and the rent they pay the mall. I want you to find the vendor that makes the least money, relative to the rent it pays. Then, tell me what is listed in the “type” column for that vendor.

Any other value (-100 to 100, excluding 0) causes an `UhOh` exception and retry.\n\n**FINAL NUMERIC OUTPUT: 0**\n\nThe program will always output `0` because:\n- The retry loop continues indefinitely until `Yeah()` returns `True`\n- `Yeah()` only returns `True` when `self.value == 0`\n- When this condition is met, `keep_trying()` returns `maybe.value` (which is 0)\n- The main execution prints this returned value\n\nThe randomness in `randint(-100, 100)` only affects how many iterations it takes to find a 0, but the final output is deterministic: it will always be 0. The program essentially implements a probabilistic search for the value 0 among random integers, and once found, that's the value it outputs.\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `workspace/target_python_code.py`: Complete copy of the analyzed code\n- `workspace/code_execution_analysis.txt`: Detailed analysis documentation\n\n**Task Status**: COMPLETE - Successfully parsed the Python code, traced its execution logic, and determined the final numeric output is 0.",

### Determining a no-backtracking closed walk through all Earl Smith’s plots in the spreadsheet

**TASK**: Each cell in the attached spreadsheet represents a plot of land. The color of the cell indicates who owns that plot. Green cells are plots owned by Earl Smith. Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking? For this question, consider backtracking to be any instance where Earl would enter a plot of land he had already entered since leaving his starting plot.

Key findings: Earl Smith owns 49 contiguous land plots covering a 16x6 area, with complete cell addresses and coordinates documented.

Verified the graph is connected (essential prerequisite for Hamiltonian cycle possibility).\n\n3. **Hamiltonian Cycle Detection (✅ Complete)**: Implemented backtracking algorithm that systematically explored all possible paths through Earl's connected land area. The algorithm completed efficiently in 0.050 seconds and definitively determined that no Hamiltonian cycle exists.\n\n**Technical Results:**\n- Graph structure: 49 nodes, 58 edges, average degree 2.37\n- Graph connectivity: CONNECTED (necessary condition met)\n- Hamiltonian cycle: DOES NOT EXIST (sufficient condition failed)\n- Algorithm: Backtracking with complete path exploration\n- Computation time: 0.050 seconds\n\n**Practical Implications for Earl:**\nEarl's desired walking route is mathematically impossible given his land layout. The adjacency constraints of his 49 plots do not permit a path that visits each plot exactly once and returns to the starting point. Earl would need to either:\n- Accept visiting some plots more than once during his walk, or\n- Accept not returning to his starting plot (pursue a Hamiltonian path instead of cycle)\n\n**Output Files Created:**\n- `workspace/earl_hamiltonian_graph.json`: Complete graph structure and adjacency data\n- `workspace/hamiltonian_cycle_results.json`: Detailed algorithm results and conclusions\n\nThe graph theory analysis is complete and the Hamiltonian path problem has been definitively solved.
