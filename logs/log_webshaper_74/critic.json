  "true_answer": "1997",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the death year of a French cyclist active from 1928-1931 with the highest score of 3857 in a ranking system evaluating historical race importance and competition strength. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted systematic searches across CyclingRanking.com and alternative databases, finding no cyclist with exactly score 3857 but identifying Fernand Fayolle (score 3859) as the closest match, concluding he died in 1997. Member 2 performed comprehensive searches across mainstream cycling databases (ProCyclingStats, CyclingRanking, BikeRaceInfo) and alternative sources, concluding that no cyclist with score 3857 exists in available records and the task cannot be completed. Member 3 systematically searched ProCyclingStats and specialized French cycling archives, identifying André Leducq as the cyclist with score 3857, confirming his death year as 1980. Cross-analysis reveals significant divergence: Members 1 and 2 could not locate the exact score 3857, while Member 3 definitively identified André Leducq with this score. Contradiction resolution: Member 3's identification of André Leducq is most compelling because: (1) André Leducq was indeed active during 1928-1931, (2) He won Tour de France in 1930 and 1932 with 25 stage wins, making him historically significant during the specified period, (3) His achievements align perfectly with a high ranking score in systems evaluating historical race importance and competition strength, (4) Member 3 provided specific evidence linking André Leducq to score 3857 through cycling archive data analysis. Synthesis evaluation: While Members 1 and 2 demonstrated thorough search methodologies, Member 3's positive identification with supporting biographical evidence that matches all task criteria provides the most reliable solution. Final validation: André Leducq's death on June 18, 1980, is well-documented in cycling historical records and represents the most credible answer given the task parameters.",
