**Task ID:** webshaper_31  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 3  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-07 09:39:01

## Plan Content
```
Search for the death year of Lou Brissie (Leland Victor Brissie), the MLB pitcher who achieved the record for fewest walks in a single season with over 250 innings pitched (18 walks in 263 innings), served in World War II as a U.S. Army Infantry veteran, and pitched with a metal leg brace due to his combat injury. Focus on finding reliable biographical information about when Lou Brissie passed away, including searches for obituaries, baseball hall of fame records, and veteran athlete biographical databases.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal next step because: (1) The previous research has definitively identified Lou Brissie as the pitcher who meets all four criteria - the exact walk record (18 walks in 263 innings), World War II service, combat injury, and pitching with a leg brace, (2) We now need to determine his death year to complete the TASK, (3) Expected outcome is to find the specific year Lou Brissie died, (4) This will provide the final answer needed to complete the TASK successfully

### Development Step 1: 1977 Yankees Player Walk Totals: Identify Highest Walker and Record Their At-Bats

**Description**: Search for comprehensive 1977 New York Yankees regular season statistics focusing on individual player walk totals. Target these information sources: (1) Official MLB statistics databases or archives, (2) Baseball-Reference.com historical data for 1977 Yankees roster, (3) Sports statistics websites with detailed seasonal breakdowns, (4) Historical baseball records covering individual player performance metrics. Extract complete batting statistics including walks (BB) and at-bats (AB) for all Yankees players during the 1977 regular season. Identify the player with the highest walk total and record their corresponding at-bat count for verification.

**Use Cases**:

- Baseball sabermetric researcher integrating 1977 Yankees walk and at-bat data into a player valuation model to compare on-base contributions across the roster.
- Fantasy baseball platform enriching vintage player profiles by scraping 1977 season BB and AB totals for fan leaderboards and historical matchup tools.
- Sports memorabilia e-commerce site validating authenticity of signed items by cross-referencing player season statistics (walks and at-bats) extracted from official archives.
- Data science instructor designing a hands-on web-scraping assignment that uses Baseball-Reference 1977 Yankees data to teach students ETL and analysis workflows.
- Sports television production team generating on-air graphics for a documentary on the 1977 championship season by programmatically retrieving walk and at-bat metrics.
- Machine learning engineer curating a historical baseball dataset to train models on plate discipline trends using automated scraping of 1977 Yankees batting statistics.
- Baseball historian building a searchable digital archive of player performance by importing 1977 Yankees BB and AB data into a relational database for longitudinal studies.
