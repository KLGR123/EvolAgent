# Planner Initialization

## Task
At the two-minute mark in the YouTube video uploaded by the channel “GameGrumps” on May 14, 2017 as part of their playthrough of the game Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the shows’ hosts are competing on one of the game’s racetracks. What was the world record time for that track in the game’s 150cc mode as of June 7, 2023? Express your answer in minutes and seconds, rounding the seconds to the nearest hundredth, e.g. 1:01.001.

## Episodic Examples
### Calculate hours for Kipchoge at record marathon pace to cover Earth-Moon perigee distance

**TASK**: If Eliud Kipchoge could maintain his record-making marathon pace indefinitely, how many thousand hours would it take him to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon its closest approach? Please use the minimum perigee value on the Wikipedia page for the Moon when carrying out your calculation. Round your result to the nearest 1000 hours and do not use any comma separators if necessary.
