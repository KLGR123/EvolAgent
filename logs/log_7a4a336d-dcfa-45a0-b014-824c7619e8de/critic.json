  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the racetrack at 2:00 mark in GameGrumps Mario Kart 8 Deluxe video from May 14, 2017, then find its 150cc world record as of June 7, 2023. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 used systematic video identification methodology, locating 'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: The Grand Prix - PART 7 - Game Grumps VS' (Video ID: nvaLkvUkW0w) through metadata extraction and Grand Prix progression analysis, identifying Twisted Mansion as the track. Then found world record 1'53\"210 via MK World Records database, converting to 1:53.21. Member 2 used pattern analysis to conclude Mario Kart Stadium was the track, then found world record 1:33.966 through multi-source research, rounding to 1:33.97. Member 3 conducted exhaustive searches but concluded the video doesn't exist after checking 2000+ videos and multiple databases. Cross-analysis reveals fundamental disagreement: Members 1 and 2 identified different tracks (Twisted Mansion vs Mario Kart Stadium) while Member 3 found no video at all. Divergence resolution: Member 1 provided specific video metadata (upload date 20170514, video ID) and logical Grand Prix progression analysis showing Part 7 corresponds to Race 7 (Twisted Mansion). Member 2's Mario Kart Stadium conclusion relied on assumptions about series start patterns without concrete video evidence. Member 3's negative findings contradict Member 1's specific video identification with metadata. Synthesis evaluation: Member 1's approach demonstrates highest methodological rigor with verifiable video metadata, systematic track progression analysis, and authoritative world record database sourcing. The specific video ID and upload date confirmation provide concrete evidence supporting Twisted Mansion identification. Final validation: Member 1's 1:53.21 answer is based on most reliable methodology and verifiable sources.",
