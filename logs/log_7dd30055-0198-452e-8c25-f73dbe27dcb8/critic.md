## Final Answer
```
1.456
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Parse PDB file using Biopython to calculate distance between first and second atoms, reporting in Angstroms rounded to nearest picometer (3 decimal places). All three members executed identical methodological approaches with high consistency. Member 1 used manual PDB parsing due to Biopython compatibility issues but achieved correct results through standard PDB format interpretation. Members 2 and 3 successfully utilized Biopython library as specified in the task requirements. Convergence analysis shows perfect agreement across all members: (1) All correctly identified PDB ID 5wb7 structure, (2) All found first atom as N (Nitrogen) from GLU A 2 at coordinates (90.574, -8.433, 100.549), (3) All found second atom as CA (Carbon Alpha) from GLU A 2 at coordinates (91.872, -7.99, 100.059), (4) All calculated identical Euclidean distance using sqrt((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)² + (z2-z1)²) formula, (5) All achieved same final result of 1.456 Angstroms when rounded to 3 decimal places. Cross-validation confirms calculation accuracy: dx=1.298, dy=0.443, dz=-0.490, yielding distance=1.4564 Angstroms. No contradictions identified between approaches. Integration assessment: Members 2 and 3 demonstrated superior adherence to task specifications by successfully implementing Biopython library as explicitly required, while Member 1's manual parsing approach, though accurate, deviated from specified methodology. Final validation confirms 1.456 as correct answer with high confidence based on unanimous member agreement and mathematical verification.
