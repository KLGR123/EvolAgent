## Final Answer
```
Islam Karimov
```

## True Answer
```
Islam Karimov
```

## Reasoning
```
Task decomposition: The question requires identifying who led the 1992 crackdown against an organization co-founded by a former Soviet paratrooper protagonist from 'Sacred Desire'. Individual member evaluation reveals significant divergences in approach and findings. Member 1 conducted the most systematic analysis, successfully identifying 'Sacred Desire' as an Uzbekistan anti-terrorist film through manual extraction from search results, discovering two key characters: Tahir Yuldashev and Juma Namangani. Through biographical research, Member 1 determined that Yuldashev co-founded the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) and its precursor organization Adolat, and that Islam Karimov, President of Uzbekistan, led the 1992 crackdown that forced Yuldashev to flee. Member 2 conducted extensive searches but concluded the book was fictional/non-existent, failing to identify the breakthrough film reference that Member 1 found. Member 3 initially found promising leads identifying Islam Karimov as the protagonist but later contradicted this by concluding the book was non-existent. Cross-analysis shows Member 1's approach was most methodologically sound, successfully bridging the gap between the obscure film reference and historical facts. The convergence on Islam Karimov as the crackdown leader from Member 1's research provides the most reliable evidence. Member 1's systematic progression from film identification to biographical research to historical context represents superior analytical methodology compared to the other members' inconclusive searches.
