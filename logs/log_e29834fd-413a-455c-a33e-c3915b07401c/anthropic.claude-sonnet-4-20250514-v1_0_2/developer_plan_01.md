# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** e29834fd-413a-455c-a33e-c3915b07401c  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-04 04:23:25

## Plan Content
```
Search for comprehensive information about the American version of Survivor to determine the total number of unique winners through the end of season 44. Focus on identifying all individual contestants who have won Survivor across all seasons from season 1 through season 44, accounting for any potential repeat winners or special circumstances that might affect the count of unique winners.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to establish the first data point - the number of unique Survivor winners through season 44, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain a comprehensive list of all Survivor winners with verification that each winner is counted only once for uniqueness, (4) This provides the foundation for comparing against American Idol winners to calculate the difference as requested in the TASK

### Development Step 2: Post-1977 20th-Century Malko Competition Winners and Their Nationalities (Including Defunct States)

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Archiving and extracting grant awardees from a foundation’s online records (2000–2020) to analyze funding trends by recipient nationality
- Aggregating hackathon winner data from multiple tech event websites post-2015 for corporate sponsorship decision support
- Mining patent award information from USPTO HTML archives to map inventor nationalities and identify innovation hotspots
- Automating extraction of sanctioned entities from government PDF/HTML sanction lists to keep compliance databases up to date
- Building a music streaming service feature that compiles historical competition winners and their nationalities for curated playlists
- Parsing academic conference websites to index keynote speakers and their affiliations for university library catalogs
- Extracting sports tournament champions from archived sports federation pages to feed a real-time analytics dashboard for media outlets

### Development Step 8: Count Wikipedia page edits from inception through June 30, 2023

**Description**: Filter the extracted revision data from the comprehensive Wikipedia history to count only the edits made from the page's inception until the end of June 2023. Exclude any revisions that occurred after June 30, 2023, and provide the exact count of edits within the specified timeframe.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical research in digital humanities: quantifying edit frequency of the “World War II” Wikipedia article from creation until June 30, 2023 to study shifts in collective memory
- Crisis communication analysis: counting revisions on the “COVID-19 pandemic” page up to June 2023 to correlate spikes in edits with major outbreak events
- Journalism data visualization: compiling the number of edits on the “United States presidential election” article before July 2023 to illustrate media attention cycles
- Machine learning dataset preparation: selecting only revisions made to the “Climate change” page until mid-2023 to train time-aware text generation models
- Corporate competitive intelligence: tracking edit counts on rival product pages (e.g., “iPhone”) up to June 2023 to gauge public information update frequency
- NGO impact assessment: measuring contribution activity on environmental initiative articles until June 2023 to identify key volunteer editors
- Legal e-discovery and audit: auditing revision counts for contentious biography pages to establish timelines of content changes before July 2023

    "description": "Phase 4 final implementation: Complete extraction of unique Survivor winners through Season 44 from the identified winners table. The code first inspects the table analysis file structure, then loads the Wikipedia HTML and targets Table 8 which contains the comprehensive winners list. It uses regex pattern matching to extract winner names and season information from the 'winners of survivor' section, maps both numbered seasons (41, 42, etc.) and named seasons (Borneo, Australia, etc.) to their corresponding season numbers, and filters for winners of seasons 1-44. The code accounts for multiple-time winners like Sandra Diaz-Twine and Tony Vlachos, ensuring each unique person is counted only once. It provides detailed output showing each winner, their seasons won, and saves comprehensive results to a JSON file with the final count of unique winners through Season 44.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** objective perfectly. The script successfully extracted all Survivor winners through Season 44 from Table 8's comprehensive winners list. Key results: Found 46 total winner entries, identified 42 winners who won in seasons 1-44, and determined there are **42 unique winners** through Season 44 (counting each person only once despite multiple wins). The analysis correctly identified 2 multiple-time winners within seasons 1-44: Sandra Diaz-Twine (seasons 7, 20) and Tony Vlachos (seasons 28, 40). The extraction used robust regex patterns and season mapping to accurately parse winner names and seasons. Complete results were saved to 'survivor_winners_final_results.json' with detailed methodology and winner lists. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the research objective has been fully achieved. The final answer is 42 unique American Survivor winners through Season 44. No further development is needed as the comprehensive winner analysis is complete and properly documented.",
