# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_11  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-07 00:33:27

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about 'American Dragon: Jake Long' to verify it is indeed the first animated series to feature an Asian-American protagonist without stereotypes, and confirm that Dante Basco voices the protagonist Jake Long. Additionally, search for detailed information about Dante Basco's voice acting roles in Gatchaman adaptations, specifically looking for his role as Supreme Commander of Spectra in productions involving Trimark Productions and connections to 'the Luminous One' character.
```

## Plan Description
```
This verification step is necessary because: (1) The previous research identified Dante Basco and 'American Dragon: Jake Long' as the likely answer but noted medium confidence level requiring verification, (2) We need to confirm that Jake Long was indeed the first non-stereotypical Asian-American protagonist in animation, (3) We need to verify Dante Basco's specific role as Supreme Commander of Spectra in Gatchaman adaptations with Trimark Productions involvement, (4) This will provide the definitive confirmation needed to identify the correct animated series name that satisfies all the complex criteria in the TASK

### Development Step 2: Locate Actor Who Voiced Ray in Polish Version of Everybody Loves Raymond

**Description**: Search for information about the Polish-language version of 'Everybody Loves Raymond' to identify the actor who played the character Ray. Focus on finding cast information, dubbing details, or Polish adaptation records through multiple search approaches: (1) Search for 'Everybody Loves Raymond Polish version cast Ray actor', (2) Look for Polish television adaptation or dubbing information, (3) Search Polish entertainment databases or Wikipedia pages about the show's international versions, (4) Check for any Polish remake or localized version details. Extract the complete name of the actor who voiced or played Ray in the Polish version for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Localization QA for dubbing studios: automatically extract and verify voice actor names and character mappings for the Polish adaptation of a US sitcom to ensure accurate credits.
- Streaming service metadata enrichment: aggregate cast and adaptation details for ‚ÄúEverybody Loves Raymond‚Äù Polish version and other localized shows to improve content discoverability and search accuracy.
- Academic research in cross-cultural media studies: compile and compare actor and character information from multiple international versions to analyze localization and naming conventions.
- Entertainment news portal content automation: update articles with real-time information on new local adaptations and voice-cast changes for trending TV series across global markets.
- Digital library catalog enhancement: enrich catalog entries with detailed cast data from international remakes to boost user browsing, recommendations, and cross-referencing of related content.
- DVD/Blu-ray packaging and marketing asset generation: generate precise cast listings and localized credits for inclusion in physical product inserts and promotional materials.
- Fan wiki database maintenance: automate extraction and validation of character‚Äìactor relationships in localized shows to keep community-driven encyclopedias and fan sites up to date.

    "description": 'Initial comprehensive search phase for American Dragon: Jake Long and Dante Basco research. This implementation conducts 5 targeted searches: (1) Verifying Jake Long as the first Asian-American animated protagonist without stereotypes, (2) Confirming Dante Basco as Jake Long\'s voice actor, (3) Investigating Basco\'s Gatchaman roles including Supreme Commander of Spectra and Trimark Productions connections, (4) Searching for "Luminous One" character references, and (5) Gathering complete Dante Basco voice acting filmography. Each search saves JSON results to workspace/ for detailed analysis in the next iteration. The searches use specific keywords and phrases to target academic sources, entertainment databases, and authoritative film/TV resources. This systematic approach will provide comprehensive data to verify the claims about Jake Long\'s significance in animation history and Basco\'s extensive voice acting career, particularly in anime adaptations.',

The code structure and approach were sound with 5 comprehensive search strategies targeting the specific research objectives, but no actual data was retrieved due to API quota exhaustion. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no research information was successfully gathered about American Dragon: Jake Long as the first Asian-American protagonist or Dante Basco's voice acting roles in Gatchaman adaptations. The code attempted to save results to JSON files, but these files would be empty or contain only error responses.

    "description": "Implemented alternative research strategy using direct web scraping after SerpAPI quota exhaustion. This approach bypasses the API limitation by directly accessing authoritative sources: (1) Wikipedia's American Dragon: Jake Long article for protagonist verification, (2) IMDb's Dante Basco page for comprehensive filmography and voice roles, and (3) Disney Wiki for additional character context. The code includes proper session management with realistic headers to avoid blocking, implements respectful delays between requests, and performs both structured HTML parsing (when BeautifulSoup is available) and basic text analysis as fallback. Each source is saved as both raw HTML and processed JSON analysis files in workspace/ for comprehensive examination. This systematic scraping approach targets the most reliable entertainment databases to gather factual information about Jake Long's significance as an Asian-American protagonist and Dante Basco's voice acting career, particularly focusing on Gatchaman adaptations and the mysterious 'Luminous One' character connection.",

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed successfully and implemented a working alternative web scraping approach after the previous SerpAPI failure. Successfully accessed 2 out of 3 target websites: IMDb (Dante Basco's page) and Disney Wiki (American Dragon page), with Wikipedia timing out. The code found promising initial indicators - 'spectra' mentioned 4 times and 'voice' 15 times on IMDb, plus 'dante basco' mentioned 5 times on Disney Wiki. However, the actual HTML content analysis was minimal and the code only performed basic keyword counting rather than extracting the specific information required by the **PLAN**. **PLAN** alignment: 40% - data collection phase completed but detailed analysis missing. The scraped HTML files and JSON analysis files contain valuable raw data but need deeper content extraction to answer the core questions about Jake Long as first Asian-American protagonist and Dante Basco's Gatchaman roles.

    "description": "Implemented comprehensive content analysis of the successfully scraped HTML files from IMDb and Disney Wiki. This code performs deep text extraction using BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML structure and identify specific information about American Dragon: Jake Long and Dante Basco's voice acting career. The analysis includes: (1) Systematic extraction of filmography information from IMDb with context-aware matching for American Dragon and Gatchaman references, (2) Detailed paragraph analysis of Disney Wiki content focusing on protagonist status and representation themes, (3) Targeted search for cast information, voice acting credits, and character connections, (4) Review of previous analysis files to build upon existing findings. The code creates detailed JSON analysis files containing extracted paragraphs, character references, and voice acting credits with proper context preservation. This structured approach moves beyond simple keyword counting to extract meaningful text passages that can answer the specific research questions about Jake Long's significance as an Asian-American protagonist and Dante Basco's extensive voice acting roles, particularly in Gatchaman adaptations.",

The code successfully analyzed the IMDb page and found valuable data (0 American Dragon references, 0 Gatchaman references, but 1 voice acting credit), but crashed during Disney Wiki analysis when checking for key terms in paragraph text. **PLAN** alignment: 60% - IMDb analysis completed successfully and saved detailed results, but Disney Wiki analysis was interrupted by the variable scope error. The code successfully created imdb_detailed_analysis.json with comprehensive filmography extraction, but disney_wiki_detailed_analysis.json was not completed due to the crash. Immediate fix needed: Correct the variable scope issue in the Disney Wiki paragraph analysis section - the 'text_lower' variable needs to be defined before the generator expression that references it. The approach and data extraction strategy are sound, just needs the scoping bug fixed to complete the analysis.",

This implementation properly defines text_lower within the correct scope before using it in generator expressions, preventing the NameError. The code successfully: (1) Reviews the existing IMDb analysis to understand what was already found, (2) Performs complete Disney Wiki analysis with proper variable scoping and comprehensive paragraph extraction, (3) Searches for cast information in tables and lists, (4) Uses regex patterns to find character-specific information about Jake Long and Asian-American protagonist status, (5) Synthesizes findings from both sources into a structured research summary. The analysis creates detailed JSON files containing extracted paragraphs, character matches, and cast information, then provides a synthesis that tracks progress on each research question. This systematic approach moves beyond the basic keyword counting to extract meaningful content that can answer the specific questions about American Dragon: Jake Long's significance and Dante Basco's voice acting roles.",

The comprehensive content analysis completed successfully, processing both IMDb (1.3MB) and Disney Wiki (351KB) HTML files. Key findings extracted: IMDb analysis found 0 American Dragon references, 0 Gatchaman references, but 1 voice acting credit; Disney Wiki analysis found 3 character-related matches including confirmation that 'Jacob Jake Luke Long (dante basco): the titular protagonist of the show.' The code successfully created detailed analysis files (disney_wiki_detailed_analysis.json and research_synthesis.json) and performed systematic text extraction with proper context preservation. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - successfully confirmed Dante Basco voices Jake Long and extracted character information, but still needs deeper analysis to definitively answer questions about Jake Long being the 'first Asian-American protagonist without stereotypes' and Dante Basco's specific Gatchaman roles. The research synthesis shows promising evidence but marks most questions as 'Unknown - requires further analysis.'

    "description": 'Implemented comprehensive analysis of all detailed JSON files to extract definitive answers to the research questions. This code systematically inspects the structure of analysis files before parsing them, then extracts specific evidence about: (1) Jake Long\'s status as an Asian-American protagonist, (2) Dante Basco\'s voice acting confirmation, (3) Gatchaman role connections, and (4) Trimark Productions/Luminous One references. The analysis processes both the structured JSON analysis files and performs additional regex pattern matching on the raw HTML content to find Asian-American representation evidence. Key findings include confirmed evidence that Dante Basco voices Jake Long as the titular protagonist (found in Disney Wiki cast information), but limited evidence for the "first Asian-American without stereotypes" claim and no evidence for Gatchaman-related roles. The code creates a comprehensive final_research_answers.json file with confidence levels, evidence sources, and research limitations. This systematic approach provides clear answers to the PLAN objectives while acknowledging areas where additional specialized sources would be needed for complete verification.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed comprehensive analysis of previously scraped content to extract definitive research answers. The analysis successfully processed 7 existing analysis files and 2 HTML files (IMDb: 1.3MB, Disney Wiki: 351KB) to answer the core research questions. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - Successfully confirmed that Dante Basco voices Jake Long as the titular protagonist with multiple sources of evidence from Disney Wiki cast information. The code found definitive confirmation through character information matches showing 'Jacob Jake Luke Long (dante basco): the titular protagonist' and cast list entries. However, the analysis found 0 references to Gatchaman roles, Supreme Commander of Spectra, Trimark Productions, or 'Luminous One' character connections in the available sources. The research partially confirmed Jake Long as an Asian-American protagonist but could not definitively verify the claim about being 'first without stereotypes' due to limited academic sources. The code successfully created final_research_answers.json with comprehensive findings and proper confidence assessments. Main limitation: specialized anime/voice acting databases would be needed to verify the Gatchaman-related claims. The research successfully achieved its primary objective of confirming the Dante Basco voice acting relationship while identifying areas requiring additional specialized sources.",

york city borough of manhattan. jake long is a descendant of a long line of shape-shifting dragons, and it is his duty to protect a community of magical creatures secretly living among the masses in new york city. he lived with his parents, jonathan and susan, as well as his 7-year-old sister, haley. his grandfather and sister are also dragons, the dragon powers having skipped his mother\'s generation. his caucasian father is unaware of his family actually being part-dragon.\nthroughout the series, jake was taught how to use his innate magical powers by his grandfather and a 600-year-old shar-pei named fu dog. jake needs these powers to protect the other magical creatures of the city from various malevolent beings, most notably the villainous huntsclan led by the huntsman. his best friends are trixie and spud, whom he skateboarded with. he was infatuated with rose, another schoolmate who, unknown to him, was the huntsman\'s apprentice. the stories were driven by jake\'s search for balance between his life as a schoolboy and his secret life as a powerful magical guardian.\n\nproduction[]\namerican dragon: jake long was created by jeff goode, who also created the hit mtv series, undressed. disney channel ordered an initial twenty-one 30-minute episodes for the first season, all of which have been made. it was first broadcast in the united kingdom on the disney channel on january 4, 2005, in the united states on the disney channel on january 21, 2005, and on toon disney in february 2006. it has also been broadcast on the family channel in some places.\nthe theme song for season 1 was performed by the band mavin (previously known as badge). the theme song for season 2 was performed by the band, the jonas brothers.\nit had been announced that steve loter, who had served as director of disney channel\'s kim possible, would be joining the show for its second season as director and executive producer alongside the current executive producers matt negrete and eddie guzelian. however, following disney channel\'s renewal of kim possible for a fourth season, loter would resume his role as director, but still serve as an executive producer of jake long. nick filippi, who had also done some directorial work on kim possible, will be the new director of jake long. with steve loter joining the staff, the show had all of its characters and backgrounds re-designed with new animation upon request by both loter and the executives as they had disdain for the previous seasons\' designs.\n\ncharacters[]\nmajor characters[]\njacob "jake" luke long (dante

subordinates) is the leader of the huntsclan. the dragon council rates him as the #4 threat to the magical community.\nsecondary characters[]\ndragon training[]\nbecause other magical creatures look up to dragons for leadership and guidance, the dragons of the world have become official protectors of the magical realm. using their powers, strength, and abilities, the dragons of the world have formed a union of sorts and strive to protect magical creatures and the world around them and to keep normal humans from becoming aware of any magical creatures and the magical world. in many ways the dragons of american dragon: jake long, are similar to the jedi knights of star wars.\n\nthe teacher and student[]\nolder and more experienced dragons can be appointed as "dragon masters", coaches to younger and less experienced generations of dragons, their "dragon student." one traditional rule the dragon council follows is that the student and teacher should not be related. one exception to this rule is the student/teacher relationship between jake long and his grandfather, lao shi. lao shi personally asked the dragon council if he could train jake himself since he believed that one day the dark dragon would return and that jake would have to face him. the council reluctantly agreed but only on a strict basis. also, students who are unable to learn sufficiently enough from their teachers are transferred to a new dragon master.\nthe dragon council tests the progress of students through three tests that three of the council members personally administrate.\nthe test of judgment in fire (councilor kulde administrates this one): this trial tests the dragon student\'s use of judgment. in this trial, the student is guided into a warehouse where they are assaulted by ice sculptures depicting various different creatures (magical and non-magical alike), but the student must only use their fire breath to melt only the sculptures that would pose a threat.\nthe test of wisdom in battle (councilor andam administers this one): this trial tests the dragon\'s knowledge of magical creatures and the magical world. in this trial, councilor andam pits the dragon student against another magical creature of his choosing. if the student is able to overcome their opponent, they pass the test.\nthe test of courage in flight (councilor chang administrated this one, although she may no longer do so because of her imprisonment): this trial puts many of the dragon student\'s abilities to the test. in this test, the student must make their way through an obstacle course set up around draco island and must fly through three rings. not only that, but the student must also compete against another dragon, whom the student has the option of choosing. if the student is able to fly through all three rings and complete the course before their opponent, they pass the test.\n\nrules[]\ndragons follow a strict set of rules. most importantly, a dragon must not allow humans to become aware of magical creatures and their world, including themselves. when humans become aware, the dragons must then erase all knowledge (and sometimes traces of) any information of their being magical creatures. secondly, a dragon must not use their dragon powers for personal gain.\na running gag in the show is that jake ends up breaking this rule constantly, although most of the time inadvertently. jake also seems to be a rebel against certain rules, such as when trixie and spud found out about his and his grandpa\'s identities, jake was asked to use a memory-erasing potion on them, but refused ("professor rotwood\'s thesis"). jake also uses his powers for personal gain a great deal of the time, such as using his ability to shapeshift, which landed him in trouble in "dragon summit".\n\nepisode list[]\nmain article: american dragon: jake long episode list\ncriticism[]\njake\'s original season 1 dragon form in "old school training". jake\'s season 2 dragon form in the season 2 opening sequence. many audiences had mixed opinions about jake\'s excessive use of street slang. while some liked it, others despised it as irritating. there is no doubt that jake\'s personality is homage to the second and third-generation immigrants who willingly embraced american culture (and adapted to its varying accents). executive producer eddie guzelian also admits that the bravado of jake\'s character was helped shaped by dante basco\'s ad-libbing and their own writing, which parodied the "wannabe mtv gangsta" crowd. season 2 seems to have toned down on jake\'s superfluous use of slang.\nmany audiences and fans found that they had mixed opinions of season 2. the art style was changed drastically for the second season, giving the show an edgier look than the more traditional designs of the first season. however, many fans have grown past the initial shock of the drastic art change, and at the least accept the second season as its own experience, or else grown to prefer it, and the outcry that accompanied its initial showing has died down considerably. season 2 director steve loter has offered some explanation to the change in aspects such as the dragon forms, in which the forms were meant to be directly related to the dragon\'s human form and current level of development. in the case of jake, he would start out as a short, scrawny teenage dragon (as he is as a human), and need to train and develop into a muscle-bound dragon (much like his form from season 1) over time.\n\ntrivia[]\nthe name long (Èæç) is the chinese word for dragon.\nthe name lao shi (ËÄÅÂ∏à) is the chinese word for teacher. though ËÄÅ can be used as a term of respect for an old or wise person, which would make "shi" jake\'s grandfather\'s given name.\nconcept sketches show that jake\'s best friends were originally going to be named jamal and brooke, and did not look like they did as of now. jamal was a big african-american boy and brooke was a caucasian girl.\nhaley was originally going to be named brittany.\nbefore coming up with the current title, the show had three previous titles. they were: "last dragon", "american dragon", and "jake long: american dragon".\naccording to jeff goode\'s american dragon webpage, there was originally a season 1 episode titled "the order of the dragon". the episode was soon scrapped as a budgetary maneuver to hire an extra writer to help revise the script. the episode was soon rewritten into "dragon summit".\naccording to executive producer matt negrete, almost all of the early season 2 episode scripts ran longer than needed; nearly 8 minutes had to be cut from "half baked" and "the academy". an early draft of "hong kong nights" was originally going to reveal chang to be jake\'s grandmother, but was rejected due to the distaste of the scenario by standards & practices (chang would have had jake\'s mother out of wedlock), and the conflicts it created with the series timeline. an early draft of "homecoming" originally planned the episode to be a dark and dramatic two-parter, and there were even plans of killing off a main character. the disney channel considered the episode "too dark" and "too jetix", and the episode was revised into a single, 22-minute episode. during a majority of "hero of the hourglass", a series of super mario bros. sound effects can be heard, including getting coins, hitting a koopa, and the klown car from super mario world.\nin "dreamscape", a name on a door in the dream corridor is "nick filippi", who is steve loter\'s directing replacement for season 2 of american dragon: jake long, after he went back to direct kim possible for its fourth and final season.\nepisode title changes: episode 221 was originally called "student body by jake", but was changed to "supernatural tuesday" (a play on the political term "super tuesday") for legal reasons. in addition, episode 220 was originally called "youth or consequences" (an obvious nod to the classic game show "truth or consequences"), but was changed to "young at heart".\nthe name "the american dragon" is also used by a professional wrestler named bryan danielson, and, like jake long, sometimes refers to himself as "the amdrag". however, danielson had been calling himself by this name before the show\'s 2005 premiere.\nin "halloween bash", ingrid third, one of the stars of disney\'s fillmore! can be seen at jake\'s halloween party. coincidentally, most of american dragon\'s executive producers worked on that show (chris roman being the director for all of its episodes), and the writer of "halloween bash", scott gimple, created the series.\nanother tribute to the show is the name of jake\'s school: millard fillmore middle school.\nin a scene in "feeding frenzy", the female shark regurgitates various objects, including a license plate that reads "outatime". this same license plate can be found on doc brown\'s delorean in steven spielberg\'s 1985 film, back to the future.\nthough it was shown on disneychannel.com\'s video service, the episode "supernatural tuesday" is the first episode of the series to be premiered on television before the disney channel. it was shown on toon disney a full four days before disney channel\'s broadcast of the episode.\njake long\'s voice actor dante basco along with rose\'s voice actress: mae whitman would later work on "avatar: the last airbender" which premiered a month after the show.\nthis show premiere the same year as cartoon network\'s "the life and times of juniper lee" which had the exact same premiere and aired four months later.\ngallery[]\n\nappearances in other media[]\njake\nContext: disdain for the previous seasons\' designs.\n\ncharacters[]\nmajor characters[]\njacob "jake" luke long (dante
