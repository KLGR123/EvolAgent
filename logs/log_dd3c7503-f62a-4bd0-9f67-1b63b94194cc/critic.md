Task decomposition: Calculate how many cups of honey must be removed from a gallon so the remaining honey weighs less than a gallon of mayonnaise, using specific density data from LibreTexts Introductory Chemistry materials compiled 08/21/2023 by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew under CK-12 license. All three members successfully located the required LibreTexts materials and extracted density values at 25°C. Member 0 found honey: 1.42 g/cm³, mayonnaise: 0.91 g/cm³, calculating 11 cups needed based on threshold of 0.640845 gallons remaining. Member 1 obtained identical density values (1.42 g/cm³ and 0.91 g/cm³) but calculated 6 cups needed, with remaining honey weighing 3359.55g vs mayonnaise 3444.72g. Member 2 found slightly different values (honey: 1.420 g/cm³, mayonnaise: 0.910 g/cm³) and calculated 6 cups needed with verification showing 5 cups insufficient (3695.51g > 3444.72g) but 6 cups sufficient (3359.55g < 3444.72g). Cross-analysis reveals convergence on source materials and density values (minor precision differences), but significant divergence in final calculations. Member 0's calculation appears to contain an error in the mathematical approach - the threshold calculation of 10.25 cups leading to 11 cups contradicts the weight-based verification performed by Members 1 and 2. Members 1 and 2 both independently verified their 6-cup answer through direct weight calculations, showing consistent methodology and cross-validation. Resolution: Members 1 and 2's approach using direct weight comparison after each cup removal is more reliable than Member 0's threshold-based calculation. Final answer 6 is supported by two independent calculations with verification steps.
