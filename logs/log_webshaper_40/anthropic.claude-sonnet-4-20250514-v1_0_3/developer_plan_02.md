## Plan Content
```
Search for information about when Greg Chappell passed away. Look for his death date, obituaries, or biographical information that includes his date of death. Focus on finding reliable sources that confirm the year Greg Chappell died.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The HISTORY has identified Greg Chappell as the Australian cricketer who captained Australia in the historic Test match where a player first scored over 300 runs against New Zealand before the 1973-74 season, and who held the record for highest individual innings score in that match, (2) We now need to find the year he passed away to complete the TASK, (3) Expected outcome is to locate Greg Chappell's death date from reliable biographical or obituary sources, (4) This will provide the final answer to determine in which year this cricketer died

### Development Step 13: Locate and Confirm Chen Boda‚Äôs Death Year from Reliable Biographical Sources

**Description**: Search for the death year of Chen Boda, who was born in Hui'an County, Fujian Province (a region known for China's national intangible cultural heritage stone carving techniques), authored extensive critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and served as Mao Zedong's chief interpreter and ghostwriter. Focus on finding reliable biographical information about Chen Boda's death date, including searches for 'Chen Boda death year', 'Chen Boda biography died', and 'Chen Boda Èôà‰ºØËææ death date'. Cross-reference multiple sources to confirm the exact year of his death.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogy research automation for family historians: extracting and verifying death dates of ancestors from digitized local archives and memorial websites.
- Historical archive metadata enrichment for librarians: automatically identifying and updating death year fields in digital collections of political figures‚Äô biographies.
- Academic research on political elite longevity: aggregating and cross-referencing death years of mid-20th century Chinese leaders to study lifespan patterns.
- Journalistic fact-checking for obituary writing: quickly confirming the death date of prominent figures by scanning saved news article HTML and authoritative biographical sources.
- Educational publishing timeline validation: ensuring history textbook publishers have accurate death years for Mao Zedong‚Äôs inner circle when compiling political chronology.
- Cultural heritage database curation: verifying biographical details (including death year) of practitioners in regional stone carving traditions to maintain national intangible cultural heritage records.
- Compliance due-diligence in international partnerships: risk analysts confirming the life status and death information of prospective foreign business associates with politically sensitive backgrounds.

### Development Step 12: Confirm Chen Boda‚Äôs Death Year Using Multiple Biographical Sources

**Description**: Search for the death year of Chen Boda, who was born in Hui'an County, Fujian Province (a region known for China's national intangible cultural heritage stone carving techniques), authored extensive critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and served as Mao Zedong's chief interpreter and ghostwriter. Focus on finding reliable biographical information about Chen Boda's death date, including searches for 'Chen Boda death year', 'Chen Boda biography died', and 'Chen Boda Èôà‰ºØËææ death date'. Cross-reference multiple sources to confirm the exact year of his death.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated verification of executive biographical data for corporate websites, ensuring accurate tenure and death dates are displayed in leadership profiles
- Genealogical research data gathering by extracting ancestors‚Äô birth and death years from multiple online archives and historical forums
- Academic historian workflow to compile and cross-reference scholars‚Äô life spans for publication footnotes and citation databases
- Legal due-diligence automation to confirm a decedent‚Äôs death year from public obituaries and government notices when processing estate settlements
- Museum digital catalog enrichment by scraping artists‚Äô biographical death dates from art history repositories and cultural heritage sites
- Journalistic obituary preparation tool that retrieves and validates prominent figures‚Äô death years across news outlets and official statements
- Healthcare compliance system to flag and remove deceased patients from active records by automatically detecting death announcements online
- Marketing timeline creation for brand anniversaries, gathering company founders‚Äô life spans from business registries and press releases

### Development Step 16: Search and Verify Chen Boda‚Äôs Death Year via Multiple Reliable Biographical Sources

**Description**: Search for the death year of Chen Boda, who was born in Hui'an County, Fujian Province (a region known for China's national intangible cultural heritage stone carving techniques), authored extensive critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and served as Mao Zedong's chief interpreter and ghostwriter. Focus on finding reliable biographical information about Chen Boda's death date, including searches for 'Chen Boda death year', 'Chen Boda biography died', and 'Chen Boda Èôà‰ºØËææ death date'. Cross-reference multiple sources to confirm the exact year of his death.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogical research and extraction of ancestor birth/death dates from digitized family archive HTML files
- Corporate compliance auditing by identifying and verifying regulatory document expiry dates across JSON and HTML repositories
- Academic library catalog enhancement by indexing author death years from scholarly biography web pages
- Museum curation workflow automation to compile artist life spans from exhibition program HTML files
- Medical records analysis to detect patient death dates in archived discharge summaries and clinical notes
- Historical data compilation of war veteran death anniversaries from government archive HTML and JSON sources
- Entertainment industry database enrichment by scraping and confirming actor obituary dates from celebrity news sites

It extracts potential death year indicators by looking for years mentioned near death-related terms, saves all HTML results to workspace for further analysis, and provides detailed statistics on findings. The approach follows the established pattern from the Chen Boda example but adapts the search terms and analysis criteria for Greg Chappell, focusing on cricket-related biographical sources and Australian context. Results are comprehensively logged and saved to JSON format for subsequent analysis phases.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - All 8 DuckDuckGo search requests returned HTTP status 202, which indicates the requests were accepted but not processed, resulting in zero search results collected. The code structure and logic appear sound with comprehensive result analysis and file storage capabilities, but the fundamental issue is that DuckDuckGo is not returning actual search content. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no biographical information about Greg Chappell's death was obtained due to the web service access issue. The saved JSON file contains only empty results. Recommended fix: Try alternative search approaches such as (1) using different search engines or APIs, (2) directly accessing known biographical websites like Wikipedia or cricket databases, (3) implementing retry logic with different request parameters, or (4) using a different web scraping approach. The HTTP 202 status suggests the service may be rate-limiting or blocking automated requests.",

    "description": "Implementing alternative search strategy for Greg Chappell death information after DuckDuckGo failure. The code first attempts to use Google Search API if SERPAPI_API_KEY is available, executing 5 targeted queries about Greg Chappell's death. If the API key is not available, it falls back to directly accessing Greg Chappell's Wikipedia page, which is a reliable biographical source. The Wikipedia analysis approach comprehensively searches for death-related keywords ('death', 'died', 'obituary', 'passed away'), birth information, current status indicators, and analyzes years mentioned in proximity to death terms. It extracts and analyzes sentences containing both Greg Chappell mentions and death-related terms, looks for potential death years by measuring distance between years and death keywords, and provides detailed statistics on findings. All results are saved to workspace files for further analysis. This dual approach ensures we have the best chance of finding reliable information about Greg Chappell's death status, adapting to the API availability while maintaining comprehensive analysis capabilities.",

The script completed all 5 targeted search queries and collected search results, but the findings reveal a critical issue: all search results with death indicators are for different people named Gregory/Greg Chappell, not the famous Australian cricket captain. Key findings: (1) Wikipedia result shows Greg Chappell (born 7 August 1948, age 77) is still alive, (2) Multiple obituaries found are for other people with similar names who died in various years (2018, 2020, 2021, 2024), (3) No death information found for the Australian cricket legend Greg Chappell. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the search successfully determined that Greg Chappell (the Australian cricket captain) has NOT passed away and is still alive as of 2025. The extensive search results and analysis files have been saved to workspace for reference. No further development needed - the objective to find Greg Chappell's death date has been definitively answered: he is still living.",

The analysis addresses the key finding from the tester feedback that multiple obituaries exist for different Greg Chappells but the Australian cricket legend is still alive at age 77.
