# Developer Plan #4 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_40  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 4  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-10 13:47:40

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about when Bill Woodfull, the Australian cricket captain who led Australia when Don Bradman scored 334 runs against England at Leeds in 1930, passed away. Focus on finding his death date and year using search terms including 'Bill Woodfull death date', 'Bill Woodfull died year', 'Bill Woodfull Australian cricket captain obituary', and 'William Woodfull death'. Verify the information from reliable cricket databases, historical records, or official sources.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The HISTORY has corrected the original TASK premise and identified that Bill Woodfull was the Australian captain when the first 300+ run Test innings occurred (Don Bradman's 334 at Leeds in 1930), not a match involving Arthur Morris who never scored over 300 runs, (2) We now need to determine when Bill Woodfull passed away to complete the TASK, (3) Expected outcome is to find Bill Woodfull's death year from authoritative cricket or historical sources, (4) This directly addresses the core question asking for the year of death of the Australian captain from the historically significant Test match

### Development Step 4: Identify First Australian Manager in English Pro Football: Name, Club, and Tenure

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the first Australian football manager to lead a professional English club. Search for keywords including 'first Australian football manager English club', 'Australian manager Premier League Championship', 'Australia football coach England professional', and 'historic Australian manager English football'. Focus on identifying the specific manager's name, which English club they managed, and the timeframe of their tenure to establish the foundation for finding their win record.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports journalism fact-checking and milestone profiling: Automate verification of pioneering appointments (e.g., first Australian manager in English professional football) to ensure accuracy in feature articles and match previews.
- Historical sports research and archiving: Systematically extract and analyse web search results to document ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù in football management for peer-reviewed sports history papers and digital archives.
- Football analytics platform data enrichment: Integrate automated JSON parsing of search results to update manager profiles‚Äîcapturing appointment dates, clubs managed, and nationality milestones‚Äîfor real-time analytics dashboards.
- Club recruitment intelligence: Use an automated pipeline to identify and compare trailblazing coaches by nationality and tenure, informing scouting reports and diversity initiatives in football executive hiring.
- Sports trivia and interactive content creation: Mine milestone events like Harry Kewell‚Äôs 2017 Crawley Town appointment to generate quizzes, timelines, and social media posts that boost fan engagement.
- Academic sports management case studies: Extract detailed analyses of international coaching appointments to develop curriculum modules on leadership diversity and career progression in professional football.
- Social media marketing campaign automation: Schedule and publish commemorative posts on anniversaries of historic managerial hires by automatically sourcing key dates and evidence from search result analyses.
- Automated research reporting for client deliverables: Generate comprehensive, timestamped summary reports‚Äîincluding key findings, evidence counts, and next-step recommendations‚Äîtailored for sports historians, data agencies, or consultancy projects.

The approach includes: (1) Executing 6 targeted search queries focusing on death date, obituary, and biographical information, (2) Processing and categorizing search results by relevance (death-related, obituary, date-specific, cricket context), (3) Identifying specific death date patterns in the results, (4) Saving all results to a structured JSON file for further analysis, and (5) Creating a detailed analysis summary. The search specifically targets Bill Woodfull as the Australian cricket captain who led the team when Don Bradman scored 334 runs against England at Leeds in 1930. Results are saved to workspace/ directory for subsequent detailed analysis to extract the exact death date and verify it from reliable sources.",

The search queries executed properly and collected comprehensive results from multiple reliable sources. The code successfully identified that Bill Woodfull (William Maldon Woodfull) died on August 11, 1965, at Tweed Heads, New South Wales, Australia, aged 67. Multiple authoritative sources confirmed this information including Wikipedia, Australian Dictionary of Biography, ESPN Cricinfo, Sydney Morning Herald archives, and Find a Grave memorial records. The search also confirmed his cricket context - he was indeed the Australian cricket captain who led the team during Don Bradman's era, including the 1930 Leeds match mentioned in the PLAN. The code properly categorized results, saved comprehensive data to JSON files, and created analysis summaries. PLAN alignment: 100% complete - the death date (August 11, 1965) has been definitively found and verified from multiple reliable sources.

The approach includes: (1) Inspecting the structure of the search results JSON file to understand the data format, (2) Systematically analyzing all search results to identify specific death date mentions (11 August 1965), (3) Categorizing evidence by type (specific date, location, cause, circumstances), (4) Verifying information across multiple authoritative sources including Wikipedia, Australian Dictionary of Biography, ESPN Cricinfo, Sydney Morning Herald, and Find a Grave, (5) Confirming the cricket context (Australian captain during Bradman's 334 runs at Leeds in 1930), and (6) Creating a comprehensive confirmation report. The analysis definitively establishes that Bill Woodfull (William Maldon Woodfull) died on 11 August 1965 at Tweed Heads, New South Wales, Australia, aged 67, from coronary vascular disease while playing golf. This fully satisfies the PLAN objective to find his death date and verify it from reliable sources.",
