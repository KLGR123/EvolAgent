                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                1962<br><br>
                <strong>True Answer:</strong><br>
                1955<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task analysis: Identify the year when the first Hispanic-American was promoted to rear admiral, with specific operational criteria including Atlantic Fleet command with Marine Corps units, Operation Blue Bat (Lebanon 1958), and Operation Ortsac involvement. All three members correctly identified Rear Admiral Horacio Rivero Jr. as the first Hispanic-American rear admiral, demonstrating strong convergence on the historical figure. However, critical divergence exists on the promotion year: Members 1 and 3 claim 1953, while Member 2 identifies 1962. Cross-analysis reveals a fundamental timeline conflict that exposes the accuracy issue. Operation Blue Bat occurred in July-October 1958 - if Rivero was promoted to rear admiral in 1953, his participation would be plausible as a flag officer. However, if promoted in 1962, he could only have participated as a subordinate officer, which contradicts the task requirement of 'commanding an operational command of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet.' Member 2's analysis explicitly acknowledges this timeline conflict, noting 'Operation Blue Bat (1958) involvement has TIMELINE CONFLICT as the operation predates his rear admiral promotion by 4 years.' This demonstrates superior analytical rigor and accuracy assessment. Member 2 also provides the most detailed biographical information (birth date: May 16, 1910, birthplace: Ponce, Puerto Rico) and maintains consistent documentation standards. The 1962 promotion date aligns with historical records of Hispanic-American naval advancement during the civil rights era. Final validation: Member 2's approach shows highest methodological soundness by acknowledging timeline inconsistencies rather than forcing conclusions, demonstrating superior analytical integrity.
