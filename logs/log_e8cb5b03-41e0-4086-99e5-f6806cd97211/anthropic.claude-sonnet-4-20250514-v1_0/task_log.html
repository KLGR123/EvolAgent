Unfortunately, when I went back about a month later on April 21, it was no longer on the dinner menu.  Using the Wayback Machine, can you help me figure out which main course was on the dinner menu for Virtue on March 22, 2021 but not April 21, 2021?

Look for entries that show city lights on the horizon and identify which city is featured. Use search approaches including: (1) Direct access to NASA APOD archives for August 2015, (2) Search &#x27;NASA APOD August 2015 city lights horizon&#x27;, (3) Browse the official NASA APOD website archive section for that specific date range. Extract the complete APOD entries including titles, descriptions, and image details to identify which city&#x27;s lights are shown.&quot;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific NASA APOD from early August 2015 that features city lights, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the APOD entry and identify the featured city, (4) This directly addresses the first requirement of finding the city shown in the NASA picture before we can trace its namesake to Chicago architecture&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;PLAN successfully completed. The comprehensive search and analysis has definitively identified the city featured in NASA\&#x27;s Astronomy Pictures of the Day from the first week of August 2015. \n\n**FINAL ANSWER: MARQUETTE, MICHIGAN, USA**\n\n**Complete Results Summary:**\n- **Target Entry**: August 3, 2015 - &quot;A Proton Arc Over Lake Superior&quot;\n- **City Identified**: Marquette, Michigan, USA\n- **Specific Quote**: &quot;In the featured image, the yellow lights on the horizon are the city lights of Marquette, Michigan, USA.&quot;\n- **Context**: The APOD shows a rare proton arc (aurora) over Lake Superior with the city lights of Marquette visible on the horizon\n\n**Methodology &amp; Verification:**\n1. **Multi-Search Approach**: Executed 7 targeted Google searches using SerpAPI with queries like \&#x27;NASA APOD August 2015 city lights horizon\&#x27; and site-specific searches\n2. **Direct Archive Access**: Systematically accessed all 7 NASA APOD entries for August 1-7, 2015 using the standard URL format (ap150801.html through ap150807.html)\n3. **Content Analysis**: Downloaded and parsed 29 HTML files, performed regex pattern matching for city names, and analyzed context around &quot;horizon&quot; and &quot;city lights&quot; keywords\n4. **Verification**: Multiple independent confirmations from search results explicitly stating &quot;the yellow lights on the horizon are the city lights of Marquette, Michigan, USA&quot;\n\n**Files Created in workspace/:**\n- nasa_apod_august_2015_search_results.json (78KB comprehensive search data)\n- nasa_apod_august_03_2015.html (5KB - primary target file)\n- nasa_apod_city_analysis.json (detailed analysis results)\n- nasa_apod_search_summary.txt (human-readable summary)\n- 25 additional HTML files from comprehensive search coverage\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n- ✅ Successfully identified specific city: Marquette, Michigan, USA\n- ✅ Found exact APOD entry: August 3, 2015\n- ✅ Extracted complete context: Proton arc over Lake Superior\n- ✅ Verified through multiple sources and content analysis\n- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for future reference\n\nThe objective has been 100% achieved with definitive identification of the city whose lights appear on the horizon in NASA\&#x27;s APOD from the first week of August 2015.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Research the namesake of Marquette, Michigan to identify the historical figure the city was named after. Then search for landmark buildings in Chicago named after this same person. Focus on finding: (1) The historical namesake of Marquette, Michigan (likely Jacques Marquette, the French missionary and explorer), (2) Buildings or structures in Chicago named after this person, (3) The specific landmark building and its architectural details. Extract information about when the building was constructed, its significance, and most importantly, which architectural firm designed it.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is the logical next step because: (1) The previous research successfully identified Marquette, Michigan as the city whose lights appeared in the NASA APOD, (2) We now need to trace the city&#x27;s namesake to find the corresponding Chicago landmark, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the historical figure (likely Jacques Marquette) and locate the Chicago building named after him, (4) This advances us toward finding the architectural firm that designed the landmark building&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;PLAN execution is completely successful and all requirements have been fulfilled. The comprehensive research has definitively identified: (1) Jacques Marquette (1637-1675) as the historical namesake of Marquette, Michigan - he was a French Jesuit missionary and explorer who explored the Great Lakes region and Chicago area in 1674-75, (2) The Marquette Building in Chicago as the landmark structure named after this same person, (3) **Holabird &amp; Roche** as the architectural firm that designed the building, established in 1883, (4) Construction period of 1894-1895 with completion in 1895, (5) The building&#x27;s significance as an important example of Chicago School architecture and early skyscraper design. All research data has been systematically documented in workspace/marquette_comprehensive_research.json with multiple authoritative sources confirming these findings. The architectural firm that designed the Marquette Building is conclusively **HOLABIRD &amp; ROCHE**.

I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won&#x27;t buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here&#x27;s the list I have so far:<br><br>milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts<br><br>I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won&#x27;t get them when she&#x27;s at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.<br><br>```<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;Task completed successfully. The curated list of vegetables—excluding any botanical fruits and alphabetized—ensures compliance with the botanical classification requirement.

It says where we should meet for our picnic on Friday. The only problem is, it’s encrypted in the Caesar cipher, so I can’t read it. Can you tell me what it says? This is the message:<br><br>Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.<br><br>```<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &quot;Decrypt the Caesar cipher message &#x27;Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.&#x27; by testing different shift values to find the correct decryption that reveals a readable English location for the picnic meeting place.&quot;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the optimal approach because: (1) We have a Caesar cipher encrypted message that needs decryption to reveal the picnic location, (2) No previous decryption attempts have been made, (3) Expected outcome is to find the correct shift value and decode the message into readable English text, (4) This directly solves the TASK by revealing where the friends should meet for their Friday picnic&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The Caesar cipher decryption task has been completed successfully! The code systematically tested all 25 possible shift values and identified the correct decryption with shift value 10. The encrypted message &#x27;Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.&#x27; decrypts to &#x27;Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.&#x27; - a clear, readable English sentence that reveals the picnic meeting location. The analysis correctly identified this as the most likely candidate with a readability score of 12, containing recognizable English words &#x27;picnic&#x27;, &#x27;is&#x27;, &#x27;in&#x27;, and &#x27;plaza&#x27;. The results have been saved to workspace files (picnic_location.txt and all_caesar_results.txt) for reference. The PLAN objective has been 100% achieved - the Caesar cipher has been successfully decrypted and the readable English location &#x27;Polybius Plaza&#x27; has been definitively identified as the picnic meeting place.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. The developer has already decrypted the Caesar cipher message &#x27;Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.&#x27; by systematically testing all possible shift values and found that with a shift of 10, the message decodes to &#x27;Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.&#x27; This clearly reveals the meeting location for the Friday picnic. Final answer: Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.&quot;,<br>}<br>```<br><br>### Which City Has Higher Total Sales: Wharvton or Algrimand?<br><br>**TASK**: The attached spreadsheet contains the sales of menu items for a regional fast-food chain.
