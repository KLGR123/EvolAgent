## Final Answer
```
green,white
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Determine the two colors on a missing edge cube from a disassembled Rubik's cube given multiple constraints about which pieces have been found. The task requires systematic logical deduction and precise constraint application. Member 0 provided intuitive reasoning concluding 'orange, white' but lacked systematic methodology and detailed constraint verification. Member 1 demonstrated exceptional analytical rigor with comprehensive code implementation: (1) Generated all 12 possible edge pairs by excluding opposite-face combinations, (2) Systematically filtered out pairs containing 'blue' (all blue found), (3) Removed pairs containing 'orange' (adjacent pieces found), (4) Eliminated green-yellow pair (green-yellow borders found), (5) Removed red edges opposite to orange edges (opposite face constraint), (6) Identified single remaining pair through logical elimination. Member 2 conducted systematic structural analysis with logical framework but provided less computational verification than Member 1. Cross-analysis reveals convergence between Members 1 and 2 on 'green,white' answer, while Member 0 diverges with different methodology and result. Divergence resolution: Member 1's systematic filtering approach with complete constraint implementation provides most reliable methodology. The computational verification through iterative elimination demonstrates mathematical rigor. Integration validation: Member 1's code logic correctly interprets all five constraints and systematically eliminates found pieces, leaving only the green-white edge as missing. Final verification confirms 'green,white' satisfies all problem requirements with alphabetical ordering per task specification.
