## Final Answer
```
Alfonso Visconti
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the consecrator who never became pope from those who consecrated the subject of Metropolitan Museum portrait 29.100.5. All three members successfully identified the portrait as Cardinal Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara (1541-1609) by El Greco, painted ca. 1600. For the consecration research, Member 1 identified three consecrators: Pope Clement VIII (principal), Camillo Cardinal Borghese, and Alfonso Visconti, with consecration date October 10, 1599. Member 2 provided similar findings but with a different date (April 30, 1601) and slightly different name variant (Alfonso Cardinal Visconte). Member 3 confirmed the same three individuals with October 10, 1599 date, providing the most comprehensive biographical analysis. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on the three key figures despite minor date discrepancies. All members correctly identified that Pope Clement VIII was already pope (1592-1605), Camillo Borghese became Pope Paul V (1605-1621), while Alfonso Visconti/Visconte never achieved papal office. The date variance (1599 vs 1601) appears to reflect different episcopal appointments, but all sources consistently identify the same three consecrators. Member 3's research demonstrated the highest methodological rigor with comprehensive source verification, detailed biographical profiles, and systematic cross-referencing. The unanimous conclusion across all approaches confirms Alfonso Visconti as the definitive answer.
