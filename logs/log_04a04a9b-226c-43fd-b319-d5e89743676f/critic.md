## Final Answer
```
41
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Calculate how many Nature 2020 research articles would be statistically incorrect given p-value of 0.04, requiring identification of total article count and application of false positive rate principles. Member evaluation reveals significant divergence in article count determination: Member 1 found 1,002 articles through official Nature archive with type=article filter, demonstrating methodical approach with clear source verification. Member 2 conducted extensive multi-phase search but couldn't determine exact count, eventually estimating 657 articles based on publication schedule assumptions - showed thoroughness but lacked definitive source validation. Member 3 calculated 6,552 articles using pagination analysis but applied questionable 72% research ratio without sufficient justification, leading to potentially inflated count. Cross-analysis shows fundamental disagreement on baseline data (1,002 vs 657 vs 6,552), requiring careful source evaluation. Member 1's approach using Nature's official archive with explicit type=article parameter provides most reliable methodology, directly addressing task requirement to exclude 'book reviews/columns, etc.' The 1,002 count aligns with Nature's typical annual research output and comes from authoritative source with proper filtering. Statistical calculation assessment: All members correctly understood false positive rate concept (4% error rate for p=0.04), but applied different interpretations. Member 1 and 2 used direct 4% rate (1,002 × 0.04 = 40.08 → 41), while Member 3 used 5% significance level instead of the given 4% p-value. Methodological validation confirms Member 1's approach: official source + correct statistical application. Final answer 41 represents most reliable synthesis of authoritative data source with proper statistical methodology.
