### Alphabetized Botanical Vegetable List for Mom’s Strictly Categorized Grocery List

**TASK**: I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.

### Farthest U.S. Presidential Birth Cities East to West, Alphabetical List

### Identify weight and adjacent-column swap causing checksum errors in modified ISBN-13 numbers

**TASK**: The following numbers function similarly to ISBN 13 numbers, however, their validation methods are slightly different. Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

The comprehensive pre-1999 discography data for both Fiona Apple and Paula Cole has been successfully extracted, verified, and displayed with complete details including exact release dates, album titles, and proper categorization. (2) Approach selection reasoning - Based on the successful execution output, the PLAN has been 100% fulfilled with comprehensive lists of all albums released by both artists before 1999, including 8 verified releases for Fiona Apple and 6 verified releases for Paula Cole, totaling 14 releases with proper verification and categorization. (3) How this advances the plan - The research objective is complete. The output shows verified album data including Fiona Apple's notable releases (Tidal 1996, Criminal 1996, Sleep to Dream EP 1997) and Paula Cole's releases (Harbinger 1994, This Fire 1996, I Don't Want to Wait 1997), all properly categorized with confidence levels and data quality metrics. (4) Relationship to previous iterations and HISTORY feedback - The final execution successfully resolved all previous scoping errors and delivered the complete verified research results that previous iterations had collected and processed. The tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment and noted that no further development is needed. (5) File paths created in workspace/ and their contents - The final execution created workspace/final_summary_simple.json containing condensed results for easy reference, while successfully analyzing the existing fiona_apple_paula_cole_verified_albums_pre_1999.json (16,317 bytes) which contained the complete comprehensive pre-1999 discography data.

The systematic approach successfully ruled out the currently accessible database sections as sources for the target reviews.\n\nConclusion: Based on exhaustive analysis of available Christgau Consumer Guide databases through his official website, no letter grades or reviews were found for Fiona Apple's 'Tidal', Paula Cole's 'Harbinger', 'This Fire', or the other 11 pre-1999 albums in the research target list.
