  "final_answer": "Roger Miller",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the composer of a song performed by both a rooster and hamster in separate animated videos at different tempos with different lyrics. Member 1 conducted comprehensive research and successfully identified the specific content matching these criteria: Disney's Robin Hood (1973) featuring Alan-a-Dale the rooster performing 'Whistle Stop' by Roger Miller, and the famous Hampster Dance internet meme (1998) featuring animated hamsters performing a sped-up version of the same song. Member 1 provided detailed evidence including BPM analysis confirming tempo variations (original speed vs 136 BPM with variations), documented the different contextual content (Robin Hood narrative vs hamster dance sounds), and verified the connection through multiple YouTube videos. Member 2 initially found the same Roger Miller connection but then diverged into extensive searches for other possibilities (Harold Faltermeyer's 'Axel F'/Crazy Frog, 'De Colores' folk song) without finding matching rooster-hamster content, ultimately concluding uncertainty. Member 3 conducted exhaustive technical searches but concluded the described videos don't exist, missing the established Robin Hood/Hampster Dance connection that Member 1 identified. Convergence analysis: Member 1 and Member 2 both identified Roger Miller's 'Whistle Stop' as fitting the criteria, with Member 1 providing the most complete analysis. Divergence resolution: Member 3's conclusion of non-existence is contradicted by the well-documented Robin Hood/Hampster Dance phenomenon that Members 1 and 2 found. Final validation: The Robin Hood rooster and Hampster Dance connection represents a perfect match for the task requirements - same composed song, different animated characters (rooster vs hamsters), different tempos, performed in separate videos with different contextual content.",
