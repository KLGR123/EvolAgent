  "final_answer": "California: An Analysis of Immigration, 1848-1870",
  "reason": "Task analysis: This complex research question requires identifying an author who contributed to both California immigration scholarship (1848-1870) and Bancroft Library manuscript guides cataloging Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo's wartime correspondence from the Mexican-American War. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted the most systematic and methodologically sound research approach. They executed a structured two-phase search: first identifying authors of Bancroft Library manuscript guides (finding 6 potential authors including Robert H. Becker), then cross-referencing with California immigration scholarship. Their research methodology included multiple database searches (UC Berkeley Library, California Digital Library, Google Scholar) and proper verification through JSTOR academic sources. Member 1 identified 'California: An Analysis of Immigration, 1848-1870' by Robert H. Becker with supporting evidence from academic source snippets. Member 2 identified John Haskell Kemble as the author with 'The Panama Route to California, 1848-1869' but showed methodological inconsistencies and less rigorous source verification. Their approach was more scattered, identifying multiple potential authors without clear resolution methodology. Member 3 focused on Hubert Howe Bancroft with 'Immigration Patterns and Population Growth in California, 1848-1870' but relied heavily on knowledge-based analysis after web scraping failures, with less concrete source verification. Cross-analysis reveals significant divergence in author identification (Becker vs. Kemble vs. Bancroft), requiring evidence-based resolution. Member 1's JSTOR source provides the strongest documentary evidence with specific citation format typical of academic references. Convergence exists in all members understanding the core research requirements and 1848-1870 timeframe. Synthesis evaluation: Member 1's systematic database approach, concrete source citations, and methodological rigor provide the most reliable foundation. Their identification of Robert H. Becker is supported by verifiable academic source material, while other members relied more heavily on inference and less verifiable sources. Final validation confirms Member 1's answer meets all task criteria with highest evidentiary support.",
