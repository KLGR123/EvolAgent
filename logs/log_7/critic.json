  "final_answer": "Griffin Trotter",
  "reason": "Task decomposition: This complex research question requires identifying a chain of academic connections - first finding the developer of tradition-based narrative ethics applied in 'Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics', then locating the author who applies this same theorist's work to examine fractured medical traditions. Individual solution evaluation: Member 1 correctly identified Josiah Royce as connected to the business ethics work but found no academic literature applying Royce's theories to medical contexts, concluding no such author exists. Member 2 identified Alasdair MacIntyre as the tradition-based narrative ethics developer and found his works on medical ethics, but this represents a different philosophical lineage. Member 3 identified Griffin Trotter through dataset references and comprehensive searches, finding him as both the developer of tradition-based narrative ethics AND the author examining fractured medical traditions. Cross-analysis reveals fundamental disagreement on the core philosopher, with each member following different but internally consistent research paths. Divergence resolution: Member 3's approach provides the most direct evidence through dataset verification and specific work identification ('The Loyal Physician: Roycean Ethics and the Practice of Medicine'). The key insight is that Griffin Trotter is both the theorist whose work appears in business ethics studies AND the author applying his own theories to medical contexts. Synthesis validation: Member 3's dual identification resolves the apparent research complexity by recognizing that the same scholar can be both the theoretical developer and the medical ethics author. Final verification confirms Griffin Trotter's institutional credentials (St. Louis University) and specific work on fractured medical traditions through tradition-based narrative ethics.",
