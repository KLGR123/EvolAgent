## Task Description
```
The following numbers function similarly to ISBN 13 numbers, however, their validation methods are slightly different. Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

### Calculate ISBN-10 check digit for Tropicos ID of Order Helotiales

**TASK**: Compute the check digit the Tropicos ID for the Order Helotiales would have if it were an ISBN-10 number.

    "plan": "Search for the Tropicos ID of the taxonomic Order Helotiales. Conduct a comprehensive web search using multiple approaches: (1) Search the Missouri Botanical Garden's Tropicos database directly at tropicos.org for 'Helotiales', (2) Use Google search with terms 'Helotiales Tropicos ID taxonomic order', (3) Search botanical databases and taxonomic resources that may reference Tropicos IDs, (4) Look for scientific literature or taxonomic databases that cross-reference Helotiales with its Tropicos identifier. Extract the complete Tropicos ID number for the Order Helotiales, ensuring it's the correct taxonomic rank (Order level, not family or genus level entries).",
