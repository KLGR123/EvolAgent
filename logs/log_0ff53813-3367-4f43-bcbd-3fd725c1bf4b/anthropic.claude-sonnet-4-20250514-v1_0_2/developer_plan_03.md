## Plan Content
```
Analyze the documented research findings from both Manash Pratim Kashyap's and PS Fader's customer retention studies (2018-2019) stored in workspace files to identify the specific two-word model type that both researchers used in common. Review the comprehensive literature analysis files including workspace/kashyap_final_literature_report.txt, workspace/ps_fader_comprehensive_analysis.json, and workspace/ps_fader_kashyap_comparative_analysis.json to extract and compare the mathematical/statistical modeling approaches. Focus on identifying overlapping model terminology, methodological frameworks, or analytical techniques that appear in both researchers' work during the specified timeframe. Cross-reference model types mentioned in abstracts, methodologies, and research descriptions to pinpoint the exact two-word common model type.
```

## Plan Description
```
This analysis step is necessary because: (1) We have successfully gathered comprehensive literature data for both researchers from 2018-2019, (2) The HISTORY shows both researchers used various modeling approaches including simple retention modeling, Markovian approaches, beta-geometric distributions, and BTYD frameworks, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific two-word model type that appears in both researchers' work, (4) This direct comparison of documented findings will complete the TASK by revealing the common modeling approach between Kashyap and Fader's studies.

This systematic approach will identify exact matches between the two researchers' methodological approaches. I'm also providing context snippets showing how each common model type is used in both researchers' work, and saving the complete analysis results to workspace for reference.
