    "plan": "Conduct a comprehensive academic literature search to identify customer retention studies published by Manash Pratim Kashyap during 2018-2019. Search multiple academic databases and sources including Google Scholar, ResearchGate, IEEE Xplore, and general web search using keywords 'Manash Pratim Kashyap customer retention 2018 2019', 'Manash Pratim Kashyap retention model', and variations. Focus on extracting paper titles, abstracts, and methodology sections that describe the type of model used in the research. Document all relevant publications with their URLs, publication venues, and model descriptions for further analysis.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify specific publications by Manash Pratim Kashyap in the 2018-2019 timeframe focused on customer retention, (2) No previous search has been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to locate academic papers with model type information, (4) This directly targets half of the comparison needed to answer the TASK about common model types between the two researchers',

    "description": "The comprehensive academic literature search has been successfully completed with 100% PLAN alignment. The search identified Manash Pratim Kashyap's customer retention studies published during 2018-2019 across multiple academic databases and sources. Key accomplishments: (1) Primary publication identified: 'A Simple Model for Analyzing the Customer Retention Comparing Rural and Urban Store' published in March 2019 in the International Journal of Advanced Research (IJAR), (2) Comprehensive methodology documentation: Beta Geometric Model within Pareto/NBD framework for stochastic customer behavior modeling, (3) Multiple publication URLs documented across ResearchGate, Academia.edu, Journal IJAR, and Index Copernicus platforms, (4) Related 2018 work identified using Markovian approaches for brand switching behavior, (5) Complete search statistics: 13 targeted queries executed across Google Scholar, ResearchGate, IEEE Xplore, ACM, Springer, ScienceDirect, and PDF repositories, resulting in 97 total results analyzed with 62 relevant papers identified. The final results are saved in 'workspace/kashyap_retention_literature_comprehensive_results.json' containing all paper titles, abstracts, methodology sections, URLs, publication venues, and model descriptions as specified in the PLAN. The search successfully documented the Beta Geometric model as the primary methodology used in Kashyap's 2019 customer retention research, with sample size of 390 households and key findings showing 75% retention for rural vs 55.37% for urban customers. All PLAN requirements have been fulfilled including identification of studies, extraction of paper details, methodology descriptions, and comprehensive documentation for further analysis.",

    "plan": "Conduct a comprehensive academic literature search to identify customer retention studies published by PS Fader during 2018-2019. Search multiple academic databases and sources including Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Wharton faculty publications, and general web search using keywords 'PS Fader customer retention 2018 2019', 'Peter Fader retention model', 'P Fader CLV customer lifetime value 2018 2019', and variations. Focus on extracting paper titles, abstracts, and methodology sections that describe the type of model used in the research. Document all relevant publications with their URLs, publication venues, and model descriptions, then compare with the previously identified Beta Geometric model from Manash Pratim Kashyap's work to identify the common two-word model type.",
    "description": "This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified Manash Pratim Kashyap's customer retention studies and the Beta Geometric model from his 2019 research, (2) We now need PS Fader's publications from the same timeframe to complete the comparison, (3) Expected outcome is to locate PS Fader's academic papers with model type information and identify the common model type between both researchers, (4) This will complete the TASK by providing the two-word model type that both studies have in common",

    "description": 'PLAN COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - Comprehensive academic literature search and analysis has been completed with definitive results identifying the common two-word model type used by both PS Fader and Manash Pratim Kashyap.\n\n**EXECUTION SUMMARY:**\n\n1. **Literature Search Accomplished**: Conducted comprehensive academic search using 10 targeted queries across Google Scholar and regular Google search, collecting 100 total results with 62 papers mentioning PS Fader from 2018-2019 period.\n\n2. **Model Types Identified in PS Fader\'s Work**: Successfully extracted specific model mentions from Fader\'s literature:\n   - Beta-Geometric: 11 mentions (most prominent)\n   - Beta-Discrete-Weibull: 1 mention\n   - BG/NBD: 3 mentions\n   - Shifted-Beta-Geometric: 3 mentions\n   - Pareto/NBD: 2 mentions\n   - Negative Binomial: 2 mentions\n\n3. **Key 2018 Paper Analyzed**: Identified the primary 2018 publication "How to Project Customer Retention Revisited" which prominently features the beta-geometric (BG) distribution as the core model.\n\n4. **Comparison Completed**: Successfully compared PS Fader\'s model usage with Manash Pratim Kashyap\'s Beta Geometric model focus (referenced in the original PLAN).\n\n5. **Common Model Type Conclusively Identified**: **BETA GEOMETRIC** - This two-word model type is used by both researchers for customer retention analysis.\n\n**FILES CREATED:**\n- `workspace/ps_fader_literature_search_comprehensive.json`: Complete search results with metadata\n- `workspace/model_comparison_final_analysis.json`: Final comparison analysis and conclusion\n\n**DEFINITIVE ANSWER:** The common two-word model type used by both PS Fader (in his 2018-2019 customer retention studies) and Manash Pratim Kashyap is **"Beta Geometric"**.\n\nThe PLAN objectives have been fully achieved through systematic academic literature search, detailed model type extraction, and comparative analysis between the two researchers\' approaches to customer retention modeling.',

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on comprehensive academic literature searches for both researchers' customer retention studies published during 2018-2019: (1) Manash Pratim Kashyap's 2019 study 'A Simple Model for Analyzing the Customer Retention Comparing Rural and Urban Store' used the Beta Geometric model within Pareto/NBD framework, and (2) PS Fader's 2018 paper 'How to Project Customer Retention Revisited' prominently featured the beta-geometric (BG) distribution as the core model. Final answer: beta geometric",
