## Plan Content
```
Conduct a comprehensive academic literature search to identify customer retention studies published by Manash Pratim Kashyap during 2018-2019. Search multiple academic databases and sources including Google Scholar, ResearchGate, IEEE Xplore, and general web search using keywords 'Manash Pratim Kashyap customer retention 2018 2019', 'Manash Pratim Kashyap retention model', and variations. Focus on extracting paper titles, abstracts, and methodology sections that describe the type of model used in the research. Document all relevant publications with their URLs, publication venues, and model descriptions for further analysis.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify specific publications by Manash Pratim Kashyap in the 2018-2019 timeframe focused on customer retention, (2) No previous search has been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to locate academic papers with model type information, (4) This directly targets half of the comparison needed to answer the TASK about common model types between the two researchers

I'm implementing a systematic approach to search for Manash Pratim Kashyap's customer retention studies from 2018-2019. This code focuses on Google Scholar searches first, using multiple query variations to maximize coverage. The implementation includes: (1) Multiple targeted search queries combining author name with retention/churn keywords, (2) Relevance scoring system to identify papers about customer retention by the target author, (3) Structured data collection with detailed paper information extraction, (4) Progress tracking and verbose output for debugging. The code will search systematically through different query variations and collect all relevant academic publications for further analysis.",

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed without errors and successfully identified highly relevant academic publications by Manash Pratim Kashyap on customer retention. The search found 30 relevant results across multiple academic sources including ResearchGate, Academia.edu, and journal publications. Key finding: A paper titled 'A Simple Model for Analyzing the Customer Retention Comparing Rural and Urban Store' published in 2019 (matching the 2018-2019 timeframe) was found across multiple platforms. The search results contain valuable publication URLs, abstracts, and appear to align well with the PLAN requirements. However, the code appears to have stopped mid-execution (cutting off during the third search query) and the comprehensive search phases for other academic databases (IEEE, additional variations) and final results compilation were not completed. PLAN alignment: 70% complete. Next steps: Complete the remaining search queries and phases, then save the comprehensive results to 'workspace/kashyap_retention_literature_search.json' for detailed analysis of the identified publications and their methodologies.",

This implementation focuses on: (1) Academic database searches targeting IEEE, ACM, Springer, and ScienceDirect for more scholarly publications, (2) Methodology-focused searches to identify specific models used by Manash Pratim Kashyap (beta geometric, Pareto NBD, stochastic models, Markov chains), (3) Enhanced paper information extraction including methodology keyword detection, (4) Structured data collection across different search categories. The code builds upon the 30 relevant results already found and will complete the comprehensive search before saving all results to workspace for detailed analysis of publication venues, URLs, and model descriptions as required by the PLAN.',

The implementation successfully executed all remaining search phases (Phase 2: Academic Database Focused Search and Phase 3: Methodology and Model Focused Search), totaling 13 queries and finding 67 total results with 62 relevant papers identified. Key findings include: (1) Primary publication: 'A Simple Model for Analyzing the Customer Retention Comparing Rural and Urban Store' by Manash Pratim Kashyap (2019) found across multiple platforms (ResearchGate, Academia.edu, Journal IJAR), (2) Methodology identified: Uses discrete time beta geometric model and references Pareto/NBD framework for stochastic customer behavior modeling, (3) Additional related work: Brand switching behavior study using Markovian approach (2018), (4) Multiple academic database sources covered including ResearchGate, IEEE, Springer, ScienceDirect, and various PDF repositories. The search successfully extracted paper titles, URLs, publication venues, and methodology descriptions (beta geometric, Pareto/NBD, stochastic models, Markov chains) as required. PLAN alignment: 100% complete. Recommendation: Save the comprehensive search results to 'workspace/comprehensive_literature_search_results.json' to preserve the detailed findings including all URLs, abstracts, methodology keywords, and relevance scores for future analysis and documentation.",
