All requirements have been met: (1) JSON-LD file data/gaia/2023/validation/bec74516-02fc-48dc-b202-55e78d0e17cf.jsonld successfully parsed, (2) Complete researcher identification extracted for 7 total researchers (1 author + 6 editors), (3) All 5 ORCID identifiers successfully extracted and validated, (4) Structured data properly saved to workspace files. The extracted ORCID identifiers ready for pre-2020 publication queries are: 0000-0003-0396-0333 (Manuela Nagel), 0000-0002-2605-6569 (Tatjana Gavrilenko), 0000-0001-6102-7846 (John Bamberg), 0000-0002-0209-2784 (David Ellis), and 0000-0002-1053-2030 (Peter Giovannini). Output files created: researcher_identification_complete.json (comprehensive results with detailed profiles) and orcid_identifiers_list.txt (simple reference list).
