# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Parse and analyze the attached JSON-LD file data/gaia/2023/validation/bec74516-02fc-48dc-b202-55e78d0e17cf.jsonld to extract researcher identification information. Identify all ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) identifiers contained in the file, then prepare for subsequent analysis of their public profiles to count pre-2020 works. Extract the complete list of researcher IDs and examine the file structure to understand the data format and any additional metadata that might be relevant for the ORCID profile analysis.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the JSON-LD file structure and extract all researcher ORCID identifiers before we can analyze their profiles, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have a complete list of researcher IDs and understanding of the data structure, (4) This provides the foundation needed to subsequently access ORCID profiles and count pre-2020 works for calculating the average as requested in the TASK

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 16: Identify Surrey Lodge Developer Organization and Founder’s Birth Year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogical research firms automating founder identification from archival JSON and text repositories to accelerate validation of family lineage linked to fraternal organizations
- Museum curation teams extracting organizational founders and establishment dates for Victorian-era societies to enrich exhibit metadata and digital collections
- Legal due diligence platforms verifying historical property ownership by parsing research files for founders’ names and birth years in heritage estate transactions
- Academic historians running automated pipelines to cross-validate digital research outputs and generate structured biographies of 18th-century society founders
- Cultural heritage mobile apps ingesting verified JSON outputs to display founder biographies and lodge histories for self-guided Victorian-era sightseeing tours
- Nonprofit grant writers compiling evidence-backed organizational backgrounds and founder details to strengthen funding applications for preservation projects
- Digital humanities platforms integrating structured data on fraternal lodges and founders into linked open data knowledge graphs for public research
- Historical preservation consultants generating compliance-ready reports by extracting and summarizing key organizational and founder information from research artifacts

### Development Step 15: Identify Surrey Lodge’s Developing Organization, Its Founder, and the Founder’s Birth Year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum curation automation: Extracting founder names and birth years from archival JSON and text files to enrich exhibition catalogs on Victorian fraternal societies
- Genealogical research workflows: Parsing family archive data and performing targeted web searches to confirm ancestor birth dates and organizational roles
- Academic history projects: Integrating disparate research results and online biographical sources to compile detailed profiles of 18th-century organization founders
- Cultural heritage management: Synthesizing local council research and web-based historical records to document building founders and secure preservation grants
- E-learning content generation: Auto-creating concise founder biographies and timelines from raw research documents for interactive history modules
- Publishing fact-checking pipelines: Validating historical details—such as founder identities and birth years—for books on London’s Victorian era societies
- Legal due-diligence support: Combining JSON research data with targeted online searches to verify heritage property lineage and founder information in transaction reports
- Digital archive enhancement: Tagging metadata in historical building records with organization affiliations and founder birth years to improve searchability and access

### Development Step 10: Analyze Surrey Lodge research data to find its developer organization, founder, and founder’s birth year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical property due diligence: automatically scanning municipal archives and research outputs to identify the original developer company and founder’s birth year for real estate investment reports
- Heritage architecture exhibit curation: extracting organization background and founder biographical details from text and JSON research files to draft museum display panels on Victorian-era buildings
- Genealogy service enrichment: processing family history research data to pinpoint who established a family-run society or firm and retrieve their birth year for detailed lineage profiles
- Academic literature review automation: ingesting JSON and text summaries of historical studies to compile key metadata (organization, founder, development dates) for Victorian urban development theses
- Business intelligence reporting: analyzing competitor historical documentation to uncover the founding organization and its founder’s birth year for strategic market entry assessments
- Cultural heritage conservation planning: harvesting structured research and summary reports to connect heritage sites’ developers with individual founders, supporting grant applications and preservation bids
- Digital archive keyword analysis: performing targeted term counts in research datasets to map out focus areas (organization, founder, development) and generate concise summary reports for cultural resource management teams

### Development Step 11: Surrey Lodge’s Victorian Developer: Organization, Founder, and Founder’s Birth Year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Victorian heritage grant application: automatically extract the original development organization and founder’s birth year from archival research files to support a grant proposal for Surrey Lodge restoration
- Academic architectural history research: process JSON and text summaries to identify the organization that built Surrey Lodge and its founder’s biography for a doctoral dissertation on Victorian-era developments
- Museum exhibit curation: ingest historical research data to source accurate founder details and birth year for interpretive signage on South London heritage sites
- Genealogical investigations: parse workspace research files to uncover founder names and birth years, enriching family trees connected to Surrey Lodge’s development organization
- Local council planning compliance: extract developer organization and founder information from archived reports to certify conservation area designations and planning applications
- Real estate marketing for heritage properties: generate provenance narratives by pulling founder and organization data from research JSON and text summaries for luxury Victorian listings
- Digital archives management: integrate the extraction workflow into a content management system to index organization and founder metadata across multiple heritage site research files
- Legal due diligence in property transactions: analyze summary reports and JSON data to verify the original developer organization and founder’s birth year for title history documentation
