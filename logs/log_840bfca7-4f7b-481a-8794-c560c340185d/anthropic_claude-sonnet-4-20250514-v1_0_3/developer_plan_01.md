# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for the article by Carolyn Collins Petersen published on Universe Today on June 6, 2023. Look for the specific article title, content, and most importantly, identify the research paper that is linked at the bottom of the article. Extract the paper's title, authors, and URL to establish which scientific publication the article references.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate the specific Universe Today article from June 6, 2023 by Carolyn Collins Petersen to identify the referenced paper, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find the article and extract the linked research paper details, (4) This establishes the foundation for subsequently analyzing the paper to find R. G. Arendt's NASA award number information

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 13: Total Peer-Reviewed Research Articles Published in Nature in 2020

**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated departmental publication tracking and performance benchmarking for annual faculty reviews at universities
- Research funding agency compliance dashboard generation for evaluating grant recipients’ article output
- Journal editorial planning automation for end-of-year reporting of peer-reviewed article volumes
- Scientometric consultancy trend analysis and forecasting of research output in high-impact journals
- Academic library acquisition optimization based on yearly research article counts to inform subscription budgets
- Science news platform automated alerts and content feeds for publication milestones in top-tier journals
- Policy think tank monitoring of global research output trends for evidence-based decision making
- Competitor benchmarking for emerging journals to compare publication volumes against industry leaders

### Development Step 9: Nature 2020 Peer-Reviewed Research Article Count (Excluding Non-Research Content)

**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Use Cases**:
- University research office automating annual reports by extracting the exact count of peer-reviewed research articles published in Nature during 2020 to benchmark faculty performance.
- Science funding agency tracking grant recipient productivity by scraping Nature’s 2020 archive for published research papers tied to funded projects.
- Bibliometric analytics firm integrating direct Nature website data into dashboards to compare year-over-year article output across high-impact journals for clients.
- Academic librarian compiling subscription cost-benefit analyses by quantifying the number of research articles versus editorials and reviews in Nature’s 2020 issues.
- Meta-research team studying publication trends by programmatically gathering volume and issue information from Nature’s 2020 archive to model shifts in topic areas.
- Data journalist building an interactive web story on global research output by harvesting Nature’s 2020 article counts and visualizing country-level contributions.
- University tenure committee cross-verifying candidate CVs by automatically matching listed Nature 2020 publications against the journal’s official article count.
- R&D department in a biotech firm monitoring competitor activity by regularly scraping Nature’s “Browse by Year 2020” page for new research articles relevant to their field.

### Development Step 5: Total Peer-Reviewed Research Articles Published by Nature Journal in 2020

**Description**: Research and determine the total number of research articles (excluding book reviews, columns, editorials, and other non-research content) published by Nature journal in 2020. Focus on identifying peer-reviewed research articles that would typically involve statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Use Cases**:
- University research office benchmarking annual publication output by counting peer-reviewed Nature research articles from 2020 to assess departmental performance
- Pharmaceutical R&D intelligence team extracting the total number of Nature 2020 immunology papers to prioritize drug discovery projects
- Funding agency audit unit verifying grantees met their 2020 deliverable of publishing in Nature by tallying approved research articles
- Biotech market analysis group monitoring Nature’s 2020 research volume in genomics to inform competitive positioning and investor pitches
- Academic library automation workflow updating catalog records by identifying and importing all 2020 Nature journal research publications
- Science newsroom editorial planning compiling “Top Breakthroughs of 2020” from Nature by filtering and ranking the year’s key research papers
- Intellectual property analysts mapping novel technologies by surveying all 2020 Nature research articles for patent landscaping
- Environmental NGO policy team quantifying 2020 Nature biodiversity studies to support evidence-based conservation advocacy
