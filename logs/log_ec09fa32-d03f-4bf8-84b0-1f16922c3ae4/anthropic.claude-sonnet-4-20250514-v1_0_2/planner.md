## Task Description
```
Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.

    "plan": 'Analyze the ping-pong ball game mechanics described in the riddle to determine the optimal ball selection strategy. Create a mathematical model or simulation to track how balls move through the system when different pistons fire. Map out the three possible scenarios: (1) First piston fires - balls 2,3 advance, next ball enters position 3, (2) Second piston fires - ball 1 released, ball 3 moves to position 1, next two balls fill positions 2,3, (3) Third piston fires - ball 1 released, ball 2 moves to position 1, next two balls fill positions 2,3. Calculate the probability distribution for each ball (1-100) being ejected by a piston, considering that pistons fire randomly with equal probability. Determine which ball number has the highest probability of being ejected to win the $10,000 prize.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) The task requires understanding complex game mechanics with multiple conditional outcomes, (2) No previous analysis exists, (3) Expected outcome is a probability analysis showing which ball has the best winning odds, (4) This mathematical approach will provide the definitive answer needed to select the optimal ball number',

    "description": 'The ping-pong ball game analysis has been completed successfully. The mathematical model and Monte Carlo simulation with 100,000 iterations has determined the optimal ball selection strategy.\n\n**COMPLETE ANALYSIS RESULTS:**\n\n1. **Mathematical Model Created**: Successfully implemented the three piston firing scenarios:\n   - Piston 1: Balls advance sequentially, position 1 ball ejected\n   - Piston 2: Position 1 ejected, position 3 moves to position 1, two new balls enter\n   - Piston 3: Position 1 ejected, position 2 moves to position 1, two new balls enter\n\n2. **Simulation Results**: 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations revealed clear probability patterns:\n   - **Ball #1: 100.0% ejection probability** (optimal choice)\n   - Ball #2: 66.49% probability\n   - Ball #4: 63.00% probability\n   - Ball #100: 0.00% probability (never ejected)\n\n3. **Key Insights**:\n   - Ball #1 starts in position 1 and gets ejected on the very first piston fire regardless of which piston fires\n   - The deterministic analysis showed that all three pistons (1, 2, 3) eject the ball in position 1\n   - Later balls have decreasing probabilities, with ball #100 never being ejected\n\n4. **Files Created**:\n   - `workspace/ball_probability_analysis.txt`: Complete probability distribution for all 100 balls with detailed statistics\n\n**FINAL ANSWER**: Choose **Ball #1** for the highest probability of winning the $10,000 prize. This ball has a 100% chance of being ejected because it starts in position 1 and will be ejected on the first piston fire regardless of which piston activates.\n\nThe PLAN has been fully executed - mathematical model created, all scenarios analyzed, probability distributions calculated for all 100 balls, and optimal strategy determined.',

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive mathematical analysis and Monte Carlo simulation performed by the developer, the optimal strategy has been determined. Ball #1 has a 100% probability of being ejected because it starts in position 1 on the platform, and regardless of which piston fires first (piston 1, 2, or 3), the ball in position 1 is always ejected. The simulation with 100,000 iterations confirmed this deterministic outcome, showing Ball #1 with 100% ejection probability while other balls have significantly lower probabilities (Ball #2: 66.49%, Ball #4: 63.00%, etc.). Final answer: Choose Ball #1 to maximize your odds of winning the $10,000 prize.',
