## Plan Content
```
Analyze the ping-pong ball game mechanics described in the riddle to determine the optimal ball selection strategy. Create a mathematical model or simulation to track how balls move through the system when different pistons fire. Map out the three possible scenarios: (1) First piston fires - balls 2,3 advance, next ball enters position 3, (2) Second piston fires - ball 1 released, ball 3 moves to position 1, next two balls fill positions 2,3, (3) Third piston fires - ball 1 released, ball 2 moves to position 1, next two balls fill positions 2,3. Calculate the probability distribution for each ball (1-100) being ejected by a piston, considering that pistons fire randomly with equal probability. Determine which ball number has the highest probability of being ejected to win the $10,000 prize.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) The task requires understanding complex game mechanics with multiple conditional outcomes, (2) No previous analysis exists, (3) Expected outcome is a probability analysis showing which ball has the best winning odds, (4) This mathematical approach will provide the definitive answer needed to select the optimal ball number
