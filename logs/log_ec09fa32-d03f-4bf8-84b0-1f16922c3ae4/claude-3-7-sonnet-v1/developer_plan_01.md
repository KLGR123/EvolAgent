**Task ID:** ec09fa32-d03f-4bf8-84b0-1f16922c3ae4  
**Model:** claude-3-7-sonnet-v1  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-30 15:29:06

## Plan Content
```
Create a simulation to model the game show mechanics. Write a Python script that implements the described ping-pong ball platform and piston mechanism. Track which balls get ejected during the full game simulation starting with 100 balls numbered 1-100. Run multiple simulations with random piston firings to determine the probability distribution of ejected balls. Analyze the results to identify which ball number has the highest probability of being ejected, thus maximizing our chances of winning.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to analyze a complex probabilistic system with specific rules about ball movement and ejection, (2) No previous analysis has been performed yet, (3) Expected outcome will be a clear understanding of which ball positions are most frequently ejected, and (4) A simulation is the most reliable approach to solve this probability problem systematically rather than attempting pure theoretical analysis of this complex system.

    "feedback": 'Execution successful - The code ran without errors and completed the PLAN requirements. The simulation successfully modeled the game show mechanics with 100 ping-pong balls and 10 piston firings. The output shows both a single detailed example game and the results of 100,000 simulations. Analysis reveals that ball #79 has the highest probability of being ejected (1.07%), followed closely by balls #74 and #68. The code generated appropriate visualizations (saved as ejection_frequency.png and ejection_heatmap.png) and stored numerical results in simulation_results.txt for further reference. The probability distribution appears relatively flat (all top balls around 1%), indicating that while there is a slight advantage to certain ball positions, the difference is marginal. The PLAN objectives have been fully achieved, providing clear insights into optimal ball selection strategy. No further development is needed.',
