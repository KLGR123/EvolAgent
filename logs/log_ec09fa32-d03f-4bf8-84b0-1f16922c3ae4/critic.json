  "reason": "Task analysis: The problem requires determining which ping-pong ball (1-100) has the highest probability of being ejected by pistons in a game with specific movement rules. Member 1 concluded ball #79 is optimal based on simulation results showing 1.07% ejection probability. Member 2 selected ball #3 with 64.2% early ejection probability based on Monte Carlo simulation. Member 3 determined ball #1 has 100% ejection probability through mathematical analysis and simulation. Cross-analysis reveals fundamental disagreement on mechanics interpretation. The critical insight: examining the initial platform state (balls 1,2,3) and first piston firing scenarios: (1) If piston 1 fires, ball 1 is ejected, (2) If piston 2 fires, ball 1 is released (not ejected), (3) If piston 3 fires, ball 1 is released (not ejected). This reveals a key distinction between ejection (winning condition) and release (non-winning). Member 3's analysis correctly identifies that ball #1 starts in position 1 and will be ejected by piston 1 with 1/3 probability on the first firing. However, the other 2/3 probability results in ball #1 being released (not ejected). Following detailed analysis of subsequent platform states, ball #1 remains the optimal choice as it has higher overall ejection probability than any other ball. Validation through rule reexamination confirms this conclusion with high confidence.",
