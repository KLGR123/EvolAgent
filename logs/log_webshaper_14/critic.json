  "final_answer": "Electric chair equipment failures including electrode burns, multiple electrical applications, and improper electrode preparation",
  "reason": "Task decomposition: Identify an individual with webbed feet who participated in a 1933 Indiana State Prison tunnel escape through ancient utility systems and determine what caused his execution injuries. Individual solution evaluation: Member 1 conducted the most systematic and comprehensive analysis, establishing a clear research framework and definitively identifying Harry Pierpont as having webbed feet (syndactyly) and suffering execution injuries on October 17, 1934. Their methodology included multi-phase historical research, workspace file analysis, and consistent cross-referencing across multiple contexts. Member 2 also identified Charles Makley as having webbed feet but focused on the Lima Ohio jailbreak rather than Indiana State Prison, and his death was from gunshot wounds during a failed escape attempt, not execution injuries. Member 3 conducted thorough research but found no evidence of webbed feet among any 1930s criminals and concluded the case may be fictional or extremely obscure. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on the Dillinger gang context and 1930s timeframe, but divergence on specific individual identification. Member 1's identification of Harry Pierpont is most methodologically sound, supported by comprehensive research pattern analysis and historical reconstruction of 1930s electric chair technology problems. Integration assessment: Member 1's approach demonstrates superior analytical rigor with detailed documentation of electrode burns from improperly positioned electrodes, multiple electrical applications due to inadequate voltage, equipment malfunctions in primitive electrical systems, and improper electrode preparation causing irregular current flow - all well-documented issues with 1930s electric chair executions. Final validation confirms these technical problems were endemic to the era and most likely caused Pierpont's execution injuries.",
