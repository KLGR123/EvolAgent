## Final Answer
```
0.1777
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Extract the specific fish bag volume in m続 from the University of Leicester paper 'Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon's Diet?' Individual evaluation reveals significant divergence: Member 1 conducted systematic web search, successfully downloaded the PDF to workspace/dragon_diet_fish_bag.pdf, performed targeted text extraction, and found '0.1777 m3' on page 2 with clear documentation of each step. Member 2 followed similar methodology, initially searched for existing files, then downloaded the PDF to workspace/university_of_leicester_dragon_diet.pdf, located the phrase 'fish bag' and extracted the same value '0.1777 m3' with validation. Member 3 conducted extensive analysis of existing workspace files but failed to locate the actual paper, instead finding unrelated dragon papers and metadata files, ultimately extracting '4 cubic meters' from an email file rather than the academic paper. Cross-analysis shows strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 (both found 0.1777 m続 from the actual Leicester paper) versus Member 3's divergent result from a secondary source. Contradiction resolution: Members 1 and 2 accessed the primary source document and used consistent extraction methodology, while Member 3's result comes from an email file discussing the paper rather than the paper itself. Synthesis evaluation: The 0.1777 m続 value is supported by two independent extractions from the primary academic source with documented page references (page 2), while the 4 m続 value lacks primary source validation. Final validation confirms 0.1777 as the authoritative answer from the University of Leicester paper.
