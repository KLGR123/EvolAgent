## Plan Content
```
Search for information about Maya Ali's acting debut in 2012, specifically focusing on identifying the first Urdu drama series produced by Six Sigma Entertainment that aired in 2012 where she made her debut. Look for details about Six Sigma Entertainment's inaugural production and Maya Ali's early career. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Search for 'Maya Ali debut 2012 Six Sigma Entertainment first production Urdu drama', (2) Look for Six Sigma Entertainment's complete filmography and production history starting from 2012, (3) Search for Maya Ali's complete career timeline and early television work to identify her 2012 debut series.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal next step because: (1) We have identified Maya Ali as the Pakistani actress who won at DIAFA 2022, and now need to verify she matches the other criteria starting with her 2012 debut, (2) The previous research established Maya Ali as the award recipient, so we can now trace her career backwards to confirm the 2012 Six Sigma Entertainment debut, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific Urdu drama series that was Six Sigma Entertainment's first production in 2012 where Maya Ali debuted, (4) This verification step is crucial to confirm Maya Ali is indeed the actress described in all parts of the TASK before proceeding to research her film work

### Development Step 1: Identify the Polish Actor Voicing Ray in Everybody Loves Raymond

**Description**: Search for information about the Polish-language version of 'Everybody Loves Raymond' to identify the actor who played the character Ray. Focus on finding cast information, dubbing details, or Polish adaptation records through multiple search approaches: (1) Search for 'Everybody Loves Raymond Polish version cast Ray actor', (2) Look for Polish television adaptation or dubbing information, (3) Search Polish entertainment databases or Wikipedia pages about the show's international versions, (4) Check for any Polish remake or localized version details. Extract the complete name of the actor who voiced or played Ray in the Polish version for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Voice acting credits verification for a media localization agency negotiating Polish dubbing contracts
- Metadata enrichment for a streaming platform’s international sitcom catalog in Polish markets
- Academic research on cross-cultural TV adaptations, compiling Polish cast and dubbing details for a journal paper
- Entertainment journalism feature on global versions of hit sitcoms, detailing who voiced Ray in Poland
- TV and film database upkeep, automatically updating Polish version actor information for archival accuracy
- Legal and royalty auditing to confirm the Polish voice actor’s credits before distribution payouts
- AI voice synthesis dataset creation, sourcing accurate Polish voice actor names for model licensing
- Language learning app development, integrating authentic Polish dub actor references for listening exercises

    "description": "Implementation of comprehensive search strategy to find Maya Ali's 2012 debut drama series with Six Sigma Entertainment. This code executes four targeted search approaches: (1) Direct search combining Maya Ali, 2012 debut, and Six Sigma Entertainment keywords, (2) Six Sigma Entertainment's production history and filmography starting from 2012, (3) Maya Ali's complete career timeline focusing on early television work, and (4) Specific search for Maya Ali's first drama series debut. Each search uses 15 results for thorough coverage and includes detailed analysis of titles, URLs, and snippets with keyword matching for debut-related terms, production company information, career timeline data, and potential drama series names. All results are systematically saved to workspace/ directory as JSON files for subsequent analysis. The code includes comprehensive print statements to track search progress, API response status, keyword matches, and potential drama titles found in search results, enabling the tester to easily follow the research process and identify key findings.",

The CURRENT CODE OUTPUT shows searches about China's 1997 economic crisis, Asian Financial Crisis, and Chinese houses, which is entirely unrelated to the PLAN requirement of finding Maya Ali's 2012 acting debut with Six Sigma Entertainment. The output mentions 'Error during search' multiple times and shows results about economic crises and 3D models instead of Pakistani drama information. PLAN alignment: 0% - the code executed searches for a completely different topic. The CURRENT CODE shown appears correct for the Maya Ali search task, but the actual execution output suggests a different script was run.

    "description": "Corrected implementation to execute the proper Maya Ali search task as specified in the PLAN. The tester feedback indicated that the previous execution ran a completely different search about China's 1997 economic crisis instead of the Maya Ali research. This corrected code first checks the workspace directory to understand what files are present, then executes the three targeted search approaches: (1) Direct search for Maya Ali's 2012 debut with Six Sigma Entertainment, (2) Six Sigma Entertainment's production history from 2012, and (3) Maya Ali's career timeline focusing on early television work. Each search includes comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks, timeout settings, and detailed analysis of search results including keyword matching for debut-related terms, production company information, and career timeline data. The code includes extensive print statements to track execution progress and ensure the correct searches are being performed, addressing the tester's concern about script alignment with the intended task.",

{
    "role": 'tester',
    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code appears to have run a completely different search task than what was specified in the PLAN. The CURRENT CODE OUTPUT shows searches about 'Bourbon Restoration July Monarchy', 'Gaul Celtic Roman Frankish history', and 'Histoire de France' series, which is entirely unrelated to the PLAN requirement of finding Maya Ali's 2012 acting debut with Six Sigma Entertainment. The output shows multiple 'Error: name 'sentence' is not defined' and 'Error: name 'page_text' is not defined' messages, plus API connection timeout errors (Error 522). PLAN alignment: 0% - the code executed searches for French historical topics instead of Pakistani drama information. The CURRENT CODE shown appears correct for the Maya Ali search task, but the actual execution output suggests a completely different script was run that searches for French history and Tottenham football club topics. Recommended fix: Ensure the correct Maya Ali search script is being executed that matches the CURRENT CODE shown, and resolve the API connection issues that are causing the 522 timeout errors from SerpAPI.",

    "description": "Fresh implementation using DuckDuckGo search (DDGS) to avoid the API connection issues and execution mismatches reported by the tester. The previous attempts were executing completely different searches (French history, Tottenham football) instead of the Maya Ali research task. This clean implementation focuses specifically on the PLAN requirements: (1) Direct search for Maya Ali's 2012 debut, (2) Six Sigma Entertainment productions from 2012, and (3) Maya Ali's early career timeline. Using DDGS as the search backend eliminates the SerpAPI timeout errors (Error 522) encountered in previous attempts. The code includes comprehensive result analysis with keyword matching for debut-related terms, production company information, and career timeline data. Each search saves results to workspace/ with clear JSON filenames for subsequent analysis. This approach ensures the correct Maya Ali search task is executed rather than the unrelated searches that were running in previous iterations.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed the Maya Ali 2012 debut search using DuckDuckGo. The search produced comprehensive results across three targeted approaches: (1) Direct Maya Ali debut 2012 search found 10 results with multiple sources confirming her debut in 'Durr-e-Shehwar' (2012), (2) Six Sigma Entertainment productions search found 10 results with clear confirmation that 'Durr-e-Shehwar' was produced by Six Sigma Entertainment and premiered on March 10, 2012, and (3) Maya Ali early career search found 10 results providing additional career context. PLAN alignment: 100% complete - the search successfully identified that Maya Ali's 2012 debut drama series with Six Sigma Entertainment was 'Durr-e-Shehwar'. Key findings from multiple sources confirm: Maya Ali made her acting debut in 2012 with a supporting role as the younger sister of Sanam Baloch's character in 'Durr-e-Shehwar', which was produced by Six Sigma Entertainment and aired on Hum TV starting March 10, 2012. All search results have been saved to workspace files for reference. The PLAN objective has been achieved and no further development is needed - the specific drama series has been definitively identified as 'Durr-e-Shehwar'.",
