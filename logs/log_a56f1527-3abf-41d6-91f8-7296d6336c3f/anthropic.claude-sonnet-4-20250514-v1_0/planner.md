### First name of the firm that designed the Chicago landmark named for APOD horizon city namesake

**TASK**: During the first week of August 2015, one of the NASA Astronomy Pictures of the Day shows the lights of a city on the horizon. The namesake of this city also has a landmark building in Chicago named after him. What is the name of the architectural firm that designed this landmark building? Give the first name appearing in the name of the firm as of June 2023.

### Compute odds of today’s Sunset Picnic Trip using a steam locomotive

**TASK**: The attached file lists the locomotives owned by a local railroad museum. It gives each locomotive’s identifying number, operating status, and the name of the daily excursion it heads, if operational. What are the odds that today’s Sunset Picnic Trip will use a steam locomotive?
