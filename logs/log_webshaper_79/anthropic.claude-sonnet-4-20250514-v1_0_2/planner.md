### Page Count of Robot Space Series Debut by Underwater-Welder Author & Dark Peter Pan Illustrator

**TASK**: "What is the number of pages in the book that is the first volume of a series, features a robot protagonist, takes place in space, is written by an author who also wrote a graphic novel about an underwater welder set in the deep ocean exploring the theme of unresolved paternal trauma, and is illustrated by an illustrator whose work is a graphic novel series that is a dark reimagining of Peter Pan's 'never grow up' theme, featuring immortal children surviving in a post-apocalyptic world, exploring themes of moral conflict between retaining innocence and fulfilling predatory instincts, includes non-linear storytelling with origin stories from the 1763 Black Forest and 1945 Hiroshima, is illustrated with black and white art punctuated by red accents, has a narrative structure emphasizing existential monotony through sparse dialogue, and ends with an unresolved cliffhanger involving tragic loss during human confrontation?"

    "plan": "Search for information about Andrea Sorrentino's collaborations with writers to identify who he works with, and search for writers who have worked on Star Trek Aliens series to identify potential connections. Focus on finding the collaboration chain: Little Monsters artist (Dustin Nguyen) → writer → artist who illustrated Green Arrow 'Kill Machine' (Andrea Sorrentino), and separately identify writers involved in Star Trek Aliens series featuring symbiotic relationships and researcher protagonists.",
    "description": "This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have established that Jeff Lemire wrote Green Arrow 'Kill Machine' with Andrea Sorrentino as artist, but need to find the connection between Dustin Nguyen (Little Monsters artist) and Andrea Sorrentino through a shared writer collaborator, (2) The previous research didn't find Star Trek Aliens connections with Lemire/Nguyen, so we need to search more broadly for this series and its writers, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the writer who bridges Dustin Nguyen and Andrea Sorrentino, and find the Star Trek Aliens writer who connects to this collaboration chain, (4) This will help us trace the complete artist-writer-artist collaboration pattern described in the TASK",
