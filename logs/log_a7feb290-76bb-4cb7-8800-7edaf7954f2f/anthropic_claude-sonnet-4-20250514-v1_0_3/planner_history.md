# Planner History

## Execution History
```
{
    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": "Search arXiv.org for High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat) articles that were listed in January 2020. Extract the complete list of papers from this category and timeframe, then analyze each paper's available format options to determine how many had PostScript (.ps) versions available for download.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify all High Energy Physics - Lattice articles from January 2020 on arXiv before we can check their format availability, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain a comprehensive list of hep-lat papers from January 2020 with their available download formats, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement to count how many had ps versions available during that specific timeframe',
