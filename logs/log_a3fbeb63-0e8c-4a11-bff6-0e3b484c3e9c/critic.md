Task analysis: Count slides mentioning crustaceans in PowerPoint presentation data/gaia/2023/validation/a3fbeb63-0e8c-4a11-bff6-0e3b484c3e9c.pptx. All members successfully parsed the 8-slide presentation. Member 1 conducted comprehensive analysis identifying 5 crustacean-related mentions across 4 slides: 'crustaceans' on slide 2, 'isopods' on slide 4, 'Yeti crab' on slide 6, and 'Spider crab' on slide 7, with systematic extraction including text, titles, notes, tables, and alt-text. Member 2 performed structured text extraction but limited search to exact 'crustacean/crustaceans' terms only, missing broader crustacean-related vocabulary, resulting in 0 count - methodologically sound but overly restrictive scope. Member 3 used comprehensive keyword search including 'crab', 'lobster', 'shrimp', 'crayfish', 'barnacle', 'isopods' and found 4 mentions across 4 slides: 'crab' (2 occurrences), 'crayfish' (1 occurrence), and 'isopods' (1 occurrence). Convergence analysis: Members 1 and 3 both identified 4 slides with crustacean content, showing strong agreement on slide count despite different specific term identification. Divergence resolution: Member 2's restrictive search missed crustacean-related terms like 'crab' and 'isopods' which are definitively crustacean references. Integration assessment: Members 1 and 3 demonstrate superior methodological approach by recognizing that crustacean mentions include specific species names and related terms, not just the word 'crustacean' itself. Final validation: Multiple independent analyses confirm 4 slides contain crustacean references. Confidence level: high.
