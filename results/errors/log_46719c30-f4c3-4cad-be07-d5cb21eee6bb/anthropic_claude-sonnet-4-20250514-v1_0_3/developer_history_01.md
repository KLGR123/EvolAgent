This phase uses SerpAPI to search Google Scholar (for academic citations and author information), targeted Google searches focusing on IEEE and ACM databases, and general academic searches with PDF filtering. The code systematically analyzes each result for title similarity, year matching, and venue credibility, ranking potential matches by confidence score. All results are saved to workspace files for detailed analysis in the next phase. The approach prioritizes finding the exact paper with complete author information rather than similar papers, using multiple search strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of academic databases.",

The code analyzes the workspace files containing search results from Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library references, ResearchGate, and other academic sources. From the evidence gathered, the paper has two authors: Pietro Murano and I. N. Khan. The code consolidates all author name variations found across different sources (P Murano, Murano P, Pietro Murano, IN Khan, Khan IN, I. N. Khan) and formats them in the requested 'First M. Last' format. The analysis confirms these authors through multiple verification sources including Google Scholar listings, ACM citations, ResearchGate profiles, and the author's personal website. This completes the PLAN objective by providing the definitive author list with proper formatting and comprehensive source verification.",
