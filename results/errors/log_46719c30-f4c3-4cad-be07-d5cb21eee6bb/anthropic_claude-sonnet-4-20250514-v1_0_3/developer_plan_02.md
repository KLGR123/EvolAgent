# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Research the publication histories of both authors Pietro Murano and I. N. Khan to determine which author had published papers prior to 2015. Search academic databases and author profiles to identify their chronological publication records. For the author who had prior publications before 2015, identify their very first published paper by examining their complete bibliography in chronological order. Extract the exact title of that earliest publication.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified the two authors of the 2015 'Pie Menus or Linear Menus, Which Is Better?' paper as Pietro Murano and I. N. Khan, (2) Now we need to determine which of these authors had published papers before 2015 and find their first publication, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the author with prior publications and extract the title of their earliest paper, (4) This will complete the TASK by providing the title of the first paper authored by the author who had prior publication history

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Determine Year David Sklar First Published Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine

**Description**: Search for information about David Sklar and Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine journal. Focus on finding the specific year when David Sklar first introduced or published Innovation Reports in this medical education publication. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Academic database searches for 'David Sklar Innovation Reports Academic Medicine', (2) PubMed searches combining these terms, (3) Google Scholar searches for relevant publications, (4) Direct searches of Academic Medicine journal archives. Extract publication dates, article titles, and verify the connection between David Sklar and the Innovation Reports concept.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic historian mapping the origin of “Innovation Reports” by David Sklar in Academic Medicine to contextualize a literature review on medical education advancements
- Medical librarian automating the extraction of publication dates and author metadata for David Sklar’s Innovation Reports to build a searchable institutional repository
- Curriculum developer analyzing the inception year of Innovation Reports for integrating historical innovation milestones into a medical education program syllabus
- Grant proposal writer validating the first appearance of Innovation Reports by David Sklar as evidence for funding a retrospective study on innovation diffusion in healthcare
- Bibliometric analyst systematically harvesting and verifying David Sklar’s publication timeline in Academic Medicine to conduct trend analysis on educational innovation research
- Science journalist investigating the debut of Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine to write a feature story on pioneers of medical education innovation
- Healthcare quality assessor auditing the historical publication record of Innovation Reports to ensure compliance with accreditation standards for innovation coursework

### Development Step 2: Identify Year David Sklar Introduced Innovation Reports Section in Academic Medicine Journal

**Description**: Search for information about David Sklar and Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine journal. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Direct search for 'David Sklar Innovation Reports Academic Medicine journal', (2) Search Academic Medicine journal archives or database for articles by David Sklar, (3) Search for 'Innovation Reports Academic Medicine introduction year', (4) Look for historical information about when Innovation Reports section was established in Academic Medicine. Focus on identifying the specific year when David Sklar introduced or established the Innovation Reports feature in this medical journal.

**Use Cases**:
- Competitive intelligence for product teams: parse search engine results and press release archives to pinpoint the exact year a rival company introduced a flagship feature, enabling data-driven roadmap planning.
- Academic editorial research: mine online journal archives and search metadata to determine when a specific section (e.g., “Case Studies”) was first established and credit the founding editor with publication details.
- Legal compliance tracking: analyze government websites and legal databases to extract the enactment year of a new regulation by detecting keywords like “enacted” or “established” in legal snippets.
- Patent analytics for R&D: aggregate patent office search results and automatically extract filing and grant years for key inventions in a target technology domain, ranking them by relevance.
- Marketing campaign monitoring: search news aggregators and corporate blogs to identify the introduction date of a major brand slogan or sustainability initiative, capturing launch year and source URLs.
- Public policy timeline building: scrape WHO, CDC, and other public health agency archives to confirm the publication year of critical guidelines, filtering for “published” or “launched” mentions in the text.
- Technical standards research: gather search results from ISO, IEEE, and industry consortium websites to establish when a new communication protocol or best practice standard was first released.
- Corporate heritage documentation: compile internal communications, annual reports, and press coverage to verify the inception year of a company’s flagship community outreach program, extracting evidence and timestamps.

### Development Step 1: Find Nedoshivina 2010 Publication Describing Kuznetzov’s Vietnamese Specimens, Including Methods and Repository Info

**Description**: Search for Nedoshivina's 2010 scientific paper that includes descriptions of Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov. Focus on finding the complete publication with methods/materials sections or specimen repository information. Use these search approaches: (1) Academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or ResearchGate using keywords 'Nedoshivina 2010 Vietnamese specimens Kuznetzov', (2) Taxonomic databases that might reference specimen deposits, (3) Journal archives that published the paper in 2010. Look specifically for sections mentioning specimen deposition, museum collections, or institutional repositories where the Vietnamese materials were stored.

**Use Cases**:
- Entomology researcher retrieving Nedoshivina’s 2010 paper to verify Vietnamese veneer moth specimen depositories before describing a new related species
- Museum curator cross-referencing taxonomic literature to confirm the institutional repository and accession numbers of Kuznetzov’s Vietnam collection for database curation
- Graduate student compiling methods and material details from primary sources to support a molecular phylogeny of Southeast Asian Tortricidae
- Biodiversity informatics specialist automating DOI and PDF link extraction for taxonomic publications to integrate specimen metadata into an online species portal
- Conservation biologist mapping historical specimen localities in Vietnam by extracting georeferenced collection data from Nedoshivina’s publication
- Journal editor validating author-provided repository statements against original publications to ensure compliance with taxonomic code requirements
- Natural history collection manager updating digital catalogs by linking specimen records to their original taxonomic descriptions and museum holdings
- Academic librarian indexing obscure entomological articles in digital archives, using SerpAPI to locate full-text PDFs and DOIs for 2010 publications
