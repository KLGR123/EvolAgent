# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for information about the 2019 British Academy Games Awards (BAFTA Games Awards) to identify which game won the main award that year. Look for the winner of the 'Best Game' or equivalent top category award from the 2019 ceremony. Extract the game's title, developer, and any other relevant details that will help locate its Wikipedia page.

## Description
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific 2019 BAFTA Games Awards winner before we can analyze its Wikipedia page revisions, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to determine which game won the top award in 2019 and gather basic information about it, (4) This establishes the foundation for locating the game's Wikipedia page and analyzing its revision history relative to its release date.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 8: Identify Who Nominated Giganotosaurus as Featured Article in November 2016

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia Featured Article Candidates (FAC) page or nomination history for the Giganotosaurus article to identify who originally nominated it for Featured Article status in November 2016. Search for the FAC discussion page, nomination details, or article talk page archives that show the nomination process, including the username of the person who submitted the initial nomination for Featured Article consideration.

**Use Cases**:
- Wikipedia community managers tracking nomination histories to recognize prolific nominators and award community badges
- Academic digital humanities researchers analyzing nomination discussions to study peer review dynamics in online encyclopedias
- Non-profit board oversight generating reports on volunteer contributions by extracting nomination data for annual transparency statements
- Corporate knowledge management teams auditing internal wiki nomination processes to ensure compliance with editorial standards
- Data journalism teams investigating article curation patterns by mapping nomination dates and user involvement in high-profile Wikipedia topics
- AI researchers creating labeled datasets of nomination behaviors and editorial timelines from FAC archives for machine learning on collaborative editing
- Educational institutions teaching digital literacy using real nomination archives to demonstrate collaborative quality control workflows in open-access knowledge bases

### Development Step 3: Title: Identify US Survivor Winners Born in May Using Official Winner Lists and Birth Dates (Season 1–2023)

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about US Survivor winners and their birth dates. Focus on finding official sources such as CBS Survivor databases, Wikipedia pages, or entertainment databases that list all winners from Season 1 through the most recent season available as of August 2023. Extract winner names, seasons, and birth dates to identify any winners born in May.

**Use Cases**:
- Entertainment journalists compiling a feature on Survivor winners with May birthdays for a special anniversary article
- Academic researchers conducting demographic studies on reality TV show winners, focusing on age and birth month trends
- TV show producers developing themed Survivor reunion episodes based on shared winner traits, such as birth month
- Data analysts at entertainment networks automating the extraction and validation of winner statistics for audience insights dashboards
- Fans creating interactive Survivor trivia games that include questions about winners’ birth dates and seasons
- Digital archivists maintaining up-to-date, structured databases of reality show winners for use in media encyclopedias and wikis

### Development Step 61: Extract American Idol Season Winners Table from Wikipedia to JSON File

**Description**: Access the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol and extract the season-by-season winners table into workspace/american_idol_winners_list.json, capturing each season number and winner name.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated update of a fan trivia mobile app’s question bank by extracting each American Idol season winner into JSON for real-time quiz refresh
- Integration into a music analytics pipeline that correlates show winners with streaming numbers to model post-show career success
- Feeding a chatbot’s knowledge base for a television trivia assistant, enabling instant answers about which contestant won each season
- Populating an entertainment marketing dashboard that tracks winner announcements and triggers tailored email campaigns to reality TV subscribers
- Building a labeled dataset of names and seasons for training an NLP model to recognize proper nouns and dates in televised competition transcripts
- Powering a research study on reality competition outcomes by aggregating winner data alongside Nielsen ratings and social media engagement metrics
- Streamlining content curation for a streaming service by linking each winner’s discography and spotlight episodes to improve recommendation algorithms
