  "reason": "Task analysis: Find the 2019 British Academy Games Awards winner, locate its Wikipedia page, extract the release date from the page, and count revisions before the release month. All three members executed comprehensive, methodologically sound approaches with consistent results. Member evaluation: (1) Member 1 used systematic multi-source verification through SerpAPI and web scraping, correctly identified God of War as the 'Best Game' winner, retrieved complete revision history of 2,380 total revisions, confirmed April 20, 2018 release date from Wikipedia, and counted exactly 477 pre-release revisions through rigorous timestamp filtering. (2) Member 2 employed official BAFTA website analysis, definitively identified God of War through structured HTML parsing, conducted thorough revision analysis with 466 pre-release edits using a March 20, 2018 cutoff (one month before release), and provided detailed monthly breakdown of editing activity. (3) Member 3 performed comprehensive search across multiple iterations, successfully identified God of War with extensive verification, extracted complete revision history, and found 477 pre-release revisions using March 31, 2018 cutoff. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence: all members correctly identified God of War as the 2019 BAFTA winner and April 20, 2018 as the release date. Divergence analysis: Minor methodological differences in cutoff date interpretation (Members 1 and 3: end of March vs Member 2: March 20), resulting in slight variation (477 vs 466 revisions). Resolution: Members 1 and 3 used more standard 'before release month' interpretation, counting all March 2018 revisions, which aligns better with the task requirement. Synthesis: Member 1's approach demonstrated highest methodological rigor with comprehensive API usage, proper pagination, and precise timestamp filtering. Final validation confirms 477 as the accurate count of Wikipedia revisions before April 2018.",
