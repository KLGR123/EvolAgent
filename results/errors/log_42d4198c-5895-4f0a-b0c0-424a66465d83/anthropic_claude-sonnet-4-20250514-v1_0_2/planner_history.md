    "plan": "Search for information about the 2019 British Academy Games Awards (BAFTA Games Awards) to identify which game won the main award that year. Focus on finding the winner of the most prestigious category, likely 'Best Game' or 'Game of the Year' equivalent. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Search for '2019 BAFTA Games Awards winners', (2) Look up the official BAFTA website for 2019 ceremony results, (3) Search gaming news sources that covered the 2019 awards ceremony. Extract the complete list of winners and identify the primary game that would be considered 'the' winner of the 2019 British Academy Games Awards.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify which specific game won the 2019 BAFTA Games Awards before we can analyze its Wikipedia page, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to determine the winning game and establish our target for Wikipedia revision analysis, (4) This directly addresses the first requirement of the TASK to find the 2019 British Academy Games Awards winner.',

The final results clearly show 'Best Game Number of items:(6) Winner: God of War' along with the complete list of nominees (Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Astro Bot Rescue Mission, Celeste, Red Dead Redemption 2, Return of the Obra Dinn).\n\nFiles created in workspace:\n- bafta_2019_awards.html: Complete HTML source from official BAFTA page\n- bafta_2019_final_results.json: Comprehensive analysis results with winner identification\n- bafta_2019_search_results.json: Initial search strategy results\n- bafta_2019_links.json: Extracted links for 2019-specific content\n\nThe task objective to 'identify which game won the main award' at the 2019 British Academy Games Awards has been fully achieved with **God of War** being the definitive answer.",

    "plan": "Access the Wikipedia page for 'God of War (2018 video game)' and retrieve its complete revision history from the page's creation until the month before its release date. First, identify the release date listed on the current Wikipedia page, then use Wikipedia's revision history API to count all revisions that occurred before that release month. Extract the revision timestamps, count the total number of edits, and determine how much pre-release information was available through Wikipedia editing activity.",
