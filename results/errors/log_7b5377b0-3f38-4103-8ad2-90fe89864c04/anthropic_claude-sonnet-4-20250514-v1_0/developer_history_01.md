    "description": "This code conducts a comprehensive web search to find the year of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. I'm using multiple search queries to cross-reference the information: (1) Direct searches for 'Venezuelan Declaration of Independence year', (2) Historical context searches about Venezuela's independence from Spain, (3) Searches including key historical figures like Simon Bolivar, and (4) Searches for specific dates like April 19. The code analyzes all search results to extract year patterns, counts the frequency of each year mentioned, and identifies the most commonly cited year across multiple sources. It also performs verification by checking results from reliable sources like Wikipedia, Britannica, and educational institutions. Once the independence year is determined, it extracts the last two digits to calculate the value of L for the equation. The results are saved to a JSON file for reference and verification.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements comprehensively. The script conducted 6 different web searches using multiple query approaches, successfully extracted year information from search results, and performed thorough cross-reference analysis. The output clearly identifies 1811 as the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence year with high confidence (48 mentions across searches, with 8 mentions from reliable sources like Wikipedia). The code correctly calculated L = 11 (last two digits of 1811) and saved detailed research results to 'workspace/venezuelan_independence_research.json'. The analysis included frequency counting, reliable source verification, and historical context validation. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all search approaches were executed, multiple sources were cross-referenced, and the exact year with last two digits was successfully determined. No further development is needed.",
