    "description": 'This step is necessary because: (1) The TASK requires comparing sample standard deviations of the number of Reference Works for each Life Science domain against Health Sciences; (2) Construction of accurate search queries for each domain requires knowing the exact ScienceDirect subject-area filter tokens; (3) Extracting the subject-area names and tokens for both branches sets up all subsequent searches for ‘Reference Works’ counts by year; (4) The expected outcome is a JSON file with each Life Science domain and the Health Sciences domain mapped to its filter token, enabling precise count retrieval in following steps.',

No intermediate JSON (initial_state.json, search_json.json, api_subject_areas_full.json, etc.) could be obtained. Without either: 1) a valid Elsevier/ScienceDirect API key explicitly authorized for the Search API, or 2) a fully configured headless browser environment carrying necessary cookies/headers to bypass the 403 blockade, it is technically impossible to extract the ‘Life Sciences’ and ‘Health Sciences’ branches in this environment. Please supply a working API key or enable a proper browser automation setup to proceed.',

Supplying a working API key is necessary to move forward with extracting the subject‐area filter tree under ‘Life Sciences’ and ‘Health Sciences’, which is the prerequisite for querying Reference Works counts by domain for 2022.',
