## Episodic Examples
### Estimating Number of False-Positive Nature 2020 Papers with Mean p-Value of 0.04

**TASK**: If we assume all articles published by Nature in 2020 (articles, only, not book reviews/columns, etc) relied on statistical significance to justify their findings and they on average came to a p-value of 0.04, how many papers would be incorrect as to their claims of statistical significance? Round the value up to the next integer.
