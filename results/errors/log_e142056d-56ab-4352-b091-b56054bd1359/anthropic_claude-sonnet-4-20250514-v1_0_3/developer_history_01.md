The analysis successfully identified 12 valid coin distributions that satisfy both constraints (at least one box with ≥2 coins and one box containing exactly 6 more coins than another). The systematic approach correctly found distributions ranging from [0,6,24] to [8,8,14] coins. However, there's a critical issue with Bob's strategy analysis: the code concludes that Bob's optimal guess is 0 coins with 0 guaranteed winnings, which seems incorrect. Looking at the distributions, some have minimum values of 6, 7, or 8 coins, meaning Bob could guarantee positive winnings by guessing higher values. The algorithm logic appears flawed - it should find the highest guess value that works across ALL distributions. **PLAN** alignment: 80% complete - distributions found correctly but strategy optimization needs revision.

    "description": "Fixed the critical flaw in Bob's strategy analysis. The previous code incorrectly concluded Bob should guess 0 coins. The corrected analysis properly identifies that Bob should find the highest value he can guarantee across ALL possible distributions. This means finding the minimum value across all distribution minimums. The code now: (1) Analyzes the minimum coin value in each of the 12 valid distributions, (2) Determines Bob's optimal guaranteed strategy by taking the minimum of these minimums, (3) Verifies this strategy works for all distributions, (4) Shows risk vs reward analysis for higher guesses, (5) Provides expected value analysis assuming equal probability distributions, (6) Identifies which distributions are 'critical' in limiting Bob's optimal strategy. This gives Bob the maximum guaranteed winnings while showing the trade-offs of riskier strategies.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements. The corrected analysis properly identified that Bob's optimal guaranteed strategy is to guess 0 coins, which guarantees 0 coins regardless of the host's choice. The code correctly found that distributions [0,6,24] and [0,12,18] contain boxes with 0 coins, making any positive guess risky since the host could choose these distributions and Bob would lose everything. The analysis shows the key insight: Bob cannot guarantee more than the smallest minimum value (0) across all 12 valid distributions. The expected value analysis demonstrates the risk-reward tradeoff - while higher guesses offer better expected returns (e.g., guess 3 coins = 1.75 expected value), they also risk total loss. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete. The mathematical solution is correct: Bob's optimal guaranteed strategy yields 0 coins, though the analysis also provides valuable insight into probabilistic strategies if Bob wants to take calculated risks.

The analysis demonstrates that while Bob's optimal guaranteed strategy yields 0 coins, he could achieve higher expected values (up to 1.75 coins) by accepting calculated risks.",
