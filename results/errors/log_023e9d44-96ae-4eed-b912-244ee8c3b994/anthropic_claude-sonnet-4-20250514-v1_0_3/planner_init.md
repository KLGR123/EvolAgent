# Planner Initialization

## Task
It's May 2023, and I'm about to drive across the U.S. from California to Maine. I always recycle my water bottles at the end of a trip, and I drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles I travel, rounded to the nearest 100. Assuming I follow I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, then take I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta, how many dollars will I get back according to Wikipedia?

### Title:  
Calculate % Difference from US Standard Butterfat in Ice Cream Using 2020 Wikipedia Data

**TASK**: If this whole pint is made up of ice cream, how many percent above or below the US federal standards for butterfat content is it when using the standards as reported by Wikipedia in 2020? Answer as + or - a number rounded to one decimal place. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/b2c257e0-3ad7-4f05-b8e3-d9da973be36e.jpg
