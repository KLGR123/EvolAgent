    "description": "Initial exploration of OpenReview.net API to understand the structure and search capabilities for finding NeurIPS 2022 papers. This code tests API connectivity, explores different venue identifier formats for NeurIPS 2022, and examines the response structure to understand how papers are organized. The approach includes testing multiple venue naming conventions (NeurIPS.cc/2022/Conference, NIPS.cc/2022, etc.) and different API endpoints to identify the correct search parameters. This foundational step is crucial before implementing the specific search for authors named 'Yuri' and their paper acceptance details.",

The exploration identified that searching with {'content.venue': 'NeurIPS 2022'} successfully returns papers (found 10 papers including 'DDXPlus: A New Dataset For Automatic Medical Diagnosis'). The code also discovered that /venues and /invitations endpoints are accessible. However, the **PLAN** objective is only 30% complete - we found the correct search method for NeurIPS 2022 papers but haven't yet searched for authors named 'Yuri' or extracted acceptance/recommendation details. Next steps: (1) Use the working search parameter {'content.venue': 'NeurIPS 2022'} to get all NeurIPS 2022 papers, (2) Filter results for authors with first name 'Yuri', (3) Extract acceptance status and recommendation details from the paper data structure, focusing on 'certain' recommendation status as specified in the **PLAN**.",

The code includes progress tracking, error handling, and saves detailed results to workspace for further analysis.

    "description": "Comprehensive OpenReview.net search for NeurIPS 2022 papers by authors named Yuri with detailed acceptance status analysis. This implementation uses a multi-strategy approach: (1) Direct targeted searches using OpenReview API with author filters, (2) Comprehensive fallback strategy that retrieves all NeurIPS 2022 papers and scans for Yuri authors using case-insensitive string matching, (3) For each identified paper, fetches all related forum notes including reviews and decisions, (4) Extracts acceptance status, recommendations, and specifically searches for 'certain' recommendation status as required by the PLAN, (5) Provides detailed analysis with paper titles, author names, paper IDs, acceptance status, review counts, and recommendation details. The code includes robust error handling, progress tracking, API rate limiting, and saves comprehensive results to workspace. This addresses all PLAN requirements: finding papers by authors named Yuri, extracting acceptance status and recommendation details, and specifically identifying papers with 'certain' recommendation status.",

This completes the PLAN objective by delivering comprehensive acceptance and recommendation analysis for the Yuri author paper found at NeurIPS 2022.",
