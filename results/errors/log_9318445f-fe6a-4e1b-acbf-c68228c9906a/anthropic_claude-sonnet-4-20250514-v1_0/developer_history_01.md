    "description": "This is the first step in analyzing the image to extract fractions and mathematical problems. I'm using GPT-4o multimodal capabilities to systematically scan the image content and identify all fractions that use '/' as the fraction line. The code encodes the image to base64 format and sends it to GPT-4o with a detailed prompt that asks for: 1) Systematic content scanning from top to bottom, left to right, 2) All fractions using '/' notation in order of appearance, 3) Any mathematical problems with solutions, and 4) A complete comma-separated list. I'm also using regex to extract fraction patterns from the GPT-4o response for further processing. The results will be saved to workspace files for subsequent analysis and problem-solving steps.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed the PLAN requirements. The GPT-4o API successfully analyzed the image and extracted all fractions using '/' notation, identifying 16 unique fractions in order of appearance: 3/4, 1/4, 2/4, 1/2, 5/35, 7/21, 30/5, 6/8, 4/60, 30/90, 8/18, 9/72, 64/46, 206/340, plus their simplified forms (1/15, 1/3, 4/9, 1/8, 32/23, 103/170). The code also identified 7 sample mathematical problems with their solutions as required. Both detailed analysis and extracted fraction lists were properly saved to workspace files. The systematic parsing approach worked effectively, and the final comma-separated list of fractions has been generated. PLAN alignment: 100% complete - all fractions extracted, mathematical problems identified with answers, and results saved for reference. No further development needed.",

The code includes both the original fractions found in the image and adds any unique simplified solutions from the sample problems to create a comprehensive list. All results are saved to workspace files for reference, with the final comma-separated list being the primary deliverable that addresses the PLAN requirements.",
