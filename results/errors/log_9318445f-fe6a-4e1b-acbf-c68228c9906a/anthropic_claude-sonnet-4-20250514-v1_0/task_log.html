The task was to execute the Python script logic against the provided string array to generate a URL containing C++ source code, which has been successfully accomplished. The execution results show: (1) All 34 array elements were properly mapped and accessible, (2) The index array [33, 4, 8, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 23, 0, 26, 27, 28, 5, 30, 31, 32, 2] was used to select elements in the correct order, (3) The selected elements were joined to form &#x27;https://rosettacode.org/wiki/sorting_algorithms/Quicksort#C++&#x27;, (4) This was concatenated with the archive prefix to produce the final URL: &#x27;https://web.archive.org/web/20230609112831/https://rosettacode.org/wiki/sorting_algorithms/Quicksort#C++&#x27;. The script successfully adapted to the provided array structure without bounds issues and generated the resulting URL pointing to C++ Quicksort source code on Rosetta Code.

I&#x27;m using GPT-4o multimodal capabilities to systematically scan the image content and identify all fractions that use &#x27;/&#x27; as the fraction line. The code encodes the image to base64 format and sends it to GPT-4o with a detailed prompt that asks for: 1) Systematic content scanning from top to bottom, left to right, 2) All fractions using &#x27;/&#x27; notation in order of appearance, 3) Any mathematical problems with solutions, and 4) A complete comma-separated list. I&#x27;m also using regex to extract fraction patterns from the GPT-4o response for further processing. The results will be saved to workspace files for subsequent analysis and problem-solving steps.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;tester&#x27;,<br>    &quot;feedback&quot;: &quot;Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully completed the PLAN requirements. The GPT-4o API successfully analyzed the image and extracted all fractions using &#x27;/&#x27; notation, identifying 16 unique fractions in order of appearance: 3/4, 1/4, 2/4, 1/2, 5/35, 7/21, 30/5, 6/8, 4/60, 30/90, 8/18, 9/72, 64/46, 206/340, plus their simplified forms (1/15, 1/3, 4/9, 1/8, 32/23, 103/170). The code also identified 7 sample mathematical problems with their solutions as required. Both detailed analysis and extracted fraction lists were properly saved to workspace files. The systematic parsing approach worked effectively, and the final comma-separated list of fractions has been generated.
