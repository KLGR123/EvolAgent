    "description": "Starting the analysis by using GPT-4o multimodal model to systematically examine the image file for fractions using forward slash notation. This approach will: (1) Verify the image file exists and is readable, (2) Use GPT-4o's advanced vision capabilities to scan the entire image methodically, (3) Extract all fractions in the order they appear, (4) Identify any sample problems with answers, (5) Generate the final comma-separated list as requested. The comprehensive prompt ensures we capture all fractions systematically and don't miss any content. Results will be saved to workspace for further processing if needed.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements perfectly. The script successfully analyzed the image file, extracted all fractions using forward slash notation, identified sample problems, and generated the required comma-separated list without whitespace. GPT-4o found 15 fractions in order of appearance and provided the final result: '3/4,1/4,1/2,5/35,7/21,30/5,2/4,1/2,6/8,4/60,30/90,8/18,9/72,64/46,206/340'. The analysis includes detailed image content description, systematic fraction extraction, sample problem identification, and proper output formatting. Results were correctly saved to workspace files for future reference. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all objectives achieved including systematic parsing, fraction extraction in order, sample problem identification, and comma-separated list generation. No further development is needed.",
