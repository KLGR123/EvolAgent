    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to locate the specific 1959 US standards document to identify the items in the dried/dehydrated and Frozen/Chilled sections that meet the TASK criteria, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this historical document, (3) Expected outcome is to find and access the complete 1959 standards document with the specific sections mentioned, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to extract the baseline list of standards that we'll later check for supersession status as of August 2023",

    "description": "After comprehensive research efforts, we have successfully located and verified the July 2, 1959 USDA document 'United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products' through Google Books (ID: 5GLLnQEACAAJ). However, despite extensive attempts through multiple access methods including USDA archives, National Archives, HathiTrust Digital Library, and university collections, we encountered consistent access restrictions that prevented extraction of the specific content from the 'dried and dehydrated section' and 'Frozen/Chilled section' needed to identify the qualifying standards. While we established comprehensive contact methods for manual document retrieval (including USDA AMS direct contact, FOIA request procedures, and National Archives research services), the automated research process cannot proceed further without the baseline list of 1959 standards. The task requires identifying specific items marked as dehydrated plus qualifying Frozen/Chilled items, then determining their supersession status as of August 2023 to calculate a percentage - but this analysis cannot be completed without access to the original document content. The research infrastructure is fully established for manual follow-up, but a definitive percentage answer cannot be determined through the available automated research methods.",
