I'm calculating that 2015 was the Year of the Goat (also called Sheep in some traditions) by working backwards from 2020 (Year of the Rat). Then I'm conducting comprehensive searches using multiple query variations to find the specific Met Museum exhibition titled after this zodiac animal. The code includes both SerpAPI searches for comprehensive results and fallback direct website searches. All search results are being saved to workspace files for detailed analysis in the next step. This approach ensures I capture all relevant information about the exhibition including its full name, dates, and details about displayed artworks.",

    "description": 'This code completes the research by extracting detailed information about the identified Met Museum exhibition. I\'m first inspecting the search results file to understand its structure, then identifying the target exhibition URLs ("Celebration of the Year of the Ram"). The code fetches the main exhibition page and press release, parses the HTML content to extract the exhibition title, dates, location, description, and information about displayed artworks. I\'m using BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and regular expressions to identify date patterns. The extracted information is saved to a comprehensive JSON file for reference. This approach ensures I capture all available details about the 2015 Met Museum exhibition that was titled after the Chinese zodiac animal (Goat/Ram), fulfilling the complete requirements of the PLAN.',
