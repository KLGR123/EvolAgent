    "description": "This is the initial research phase for finding the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition titled after the Chinese zodiac animal of 2015. I'm implementing a comprehensive multi-strategy approach:\n\n1. **Chinese Zodiac Calculation**: First calculating that 2015 was the Year of the Goat (also known as Sheep or Ram) using the 12-year zodiac cycle with 1972 as a reference point.\n\n2. **Direct Met Museum Search**: Attempting to access Met Museum exhibition pages directly using various URL patterns and search terms combining the zodiac animals (Goat/Sheep/Ram) with 2015.\n\n3. **Google Search Strategy**: If SERPAPI_API_KEY is available, conducting comprehensive Google searches with targeted queries like 'Metropolitan Museum Art 2015 Goat exhibition' to find references to the specific exhibition.\n\n4. **Archive Page Analysis**: Checking Met Museum's exhibition archive pages for 2015 to identify all exhibitions from that year.\n\nThe code includes extensive logging and progress tracking, saves all retrieved content to workspace files for later analysis, and creates a comprehensive research summary. This systematic approach should capture the exhibition information from multiple angles, whether it's directly accessible on the Met's current website or referenced in search results and archives. The next phase will involve analyzing the collected data to extract the specific exhibition title, dates, and description.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully identified the target exhibition. The research correctly determined that 2015 was the Year of the Goat (also called Ram/Sheep) and found the specific Met Museum exhibition: 'Celebration of the Year of the Ram' which ran from January 17–April 12, 2015 at The Met Fifth Avenue. The Google search strategy was highly effective, collecting 67 results with 40 high-priority matches containing multiple key findings. The code successfully identified the exhibition's full title, dates, and description (seven Chinese sculptures in the shape of the ram plus a 14th-century painting depicting grazing sheep). PLAN alignment: 100% complete - all required information has been extracted. The comprehensive output contains valuable research data and should be saved to workspace files for documentation. No further development needed as the core objective has been achieved.",
