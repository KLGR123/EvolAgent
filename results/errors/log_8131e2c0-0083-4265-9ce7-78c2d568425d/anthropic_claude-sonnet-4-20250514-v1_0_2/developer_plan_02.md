# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Access and analyze the search results data from workspace/james_cfm_html_analysis_20250813_203733.json to extract the specific CFM values for both the Cheater and Cheater Beater from James's season 4 testing. Cross-reference the CFM measurements (4.0, 8.0, and 560.0) identified in the previous search to determine which values correspond to which product, and format the final answer as requested: 'CFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater'.

## Description
This is the optimal next step because: (1) The developer successfully completed a comprehensive search and found specific CFM values (4.0, 8.0, and 560.0) from James's season 4 testing of Cheater vs Cheater Beater, (2) The search results have been documented in workspace/james_cfm_html_analysis_20250813_203733.json with relevance scoring and multiple CFM references, (3) Expected outcome is to extract and match the correct CFM values to each product based on the search data analysis, (4) This directly completes the TASK by providing the specific CFM measurements in the requested format

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 5: BFC Dynamo 16 August 1986 Opening Match Venue and Spectator Attendance Search

**Description**: Search for information about BFC Dynamo's opening match on 16 August 1986, focusing on identifying the specific sports complex in Berlin where it took place and the attendance figures. Search for keywords including 'BFC Dynamo 16 August 1986 opening match', 'Berliner FC Dynamo August 1986 attendance', 'DDR-Oberliga 1986-87 season opening match Berlin', and 'BFC Dynamo home stadium 1986 spectators'. Look for match reports, historical records, or sports databases that document this specific game and the number of spectators who attended at the Berlin sports complex with multiple facilities.

**Use Cases**:
- Sports historian automating the extraction of match dates, venues, and attendance figures from archival JSON search results for club monographs
- Football club data analyst generating season-on-season attendance trend reports by programmatically parsing match metadata files
- Sports journalist streamlining the preparation of anniversary articles by auto-populating venue and spectator numbers for key historic fixtures
- Cultural heritage archivist digitizing and indexing East German sports complex usage by extracting event details and attendance from legacy web scrapes
- Machine learning engineer ingesting structured match data for predictive modeling of crowd sizes at future DDR-Oberliga fixtures
- Chatbot developer integrating a Q&A feature on a club website to instantly answer fan queries about BFC Dynamo‚Äôs 1986 opener, including location and attendance
- Event operations manager using historical attendance records to forecast staffing and security needs at large sports venues
- Academic researcher compiling quantitative data on stadium utilization and public engagement in 1980s East German football for a socio-cultural study

### Development Step 4: 1977 New York Yankees Walk Totals and At-Bats: Top Walk Leader Identification

**Description**: Search for comprehensive 1977 New York Yankees regular season statistics focusing on individual player walk totals. Target these information sources: (1) Official MLB statistics databases or archives, (2) Baseball-Reference.com historical data for 1977 Yankees roster, (3) Sports statistics websites with detailed seasonal breakdowns, (4) Historical baseball records covering individual player performance metrics. Extract complete batting statistics including walks (BB) and at-bats (AB) for all Yankees players during the 1977 regular season. Identify the player with the highest walk total and record their corresponding at-bat count for verification.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated sports analytics pipeline for a baseball statistics website that scrapes historical MLB table data, filters out summary rows, and ranks players by walk-to-at-bat ratios.
- Fantasy baseball app backend for generating custom leaderboards from Baseball-Reference tables by extracting individual player walk totals and at-bat counts while excluding aggregate team lines.
- Sports journalism workflow that automatically extracts, filters, and verifies player performance metrics from archived HTML tables to power weekly ‚ÄúOn This Day in 1977 Yankees History‚Äù feature articles.
- Academic research project in sports economics that collects walk and at-bat data across seasons by scraping and cleaning historical baseball tables, ensuring only individual player entries are used for regression analysis.
- Sports betting model development where historical player walk rates and at-bat frequencies are programmatically scraped, cleaned, and ranked to serve as predictive features in machine learning algorithms.
- Museum or exhibit interactive display system that dynamically pulls, filters, and ranks 1977 Yankees player statistics from web archives to create player comparison dashboards for visitors.
- Financial data engineering scenario where quarterly earnings tables from corporate filings are scraped, summary rows excluded, and companies ranked by profit margins for investment analysis.
- Healthcare data aggregation tool that scrapes clinical trial outcome tables, filters out aggregate results, and ranks treatment arms by success rates to assist meta-analysts in systematic reviews.

### Development Step 10: Search Harry Kewell‚Äôs Crawley Town managerial record and win-loss statistics since May 2017

**Description**: Search for Harry Kewell's complete managerial record at Crawley Town, focusing on his win-loss statistics during his tenure from May 2017 onwards. Search for keywords including 'Harry Kewell Crawley Town managerial record wins', 'Harry Kewell Crawley statistics manager', 'Crawley Town Harry Kewell results 2017-2018', and 'Harry Kewell manager win percentage Crawley'. Look for official club records, sports databases, or detailed match reports that document the total number of games won during his time as manager of Crawley Town.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated sports journalism workflows: extract and compile football manager records (games managed, wins, win rates, tenure) from online search snippets into JSON for rapid article publication.
- Football club recruitment analysis: process historical managerial performance data‚Äîtotal games, win percentages, league positions‚Äîto inform candidate evaluations and hiring decisions.
- Sports betting analytics integration: aggregate manager and team performance stats into predictive models by scraping win-loss records and win rates from web search results.
- Academic sports performance research: gather comprehensive managerial career statistics (matches, wins, tenure periods, notable achievements) for quantitative analysis in sports science studies.
- Media website content personalization: power an interactive dashboard that auto-updates manager profiles by extracting the latest performance data from official club sites and sports databases into structured JSON.
- Business intelligence for sales teams: adapt this parsing method to extract quarterly sales figures, proposal win rates, and account manager tenure from CRM search-result exports into consolidated analytics reports.
- HR performance-tracking automation: extract employee project counts, success/failure rates, and tenure details from internal knowledge-base search logs, compiling them into a standardized JSON for HR dashboards.
- Compliance monitoring in finance: automate extraction of regulatory-filing data‚Äînumber of compliance checks passed, percentages, reporting periods‚Äîfrom search engine snippets into unified compliance record JSON.
