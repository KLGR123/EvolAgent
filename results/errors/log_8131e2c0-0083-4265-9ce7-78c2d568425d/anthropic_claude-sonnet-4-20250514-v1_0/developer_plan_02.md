# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Analyze the comprehensive research results from workspace/james_cheater_cfm_final_contextual_analysis_20250813_202707.json to determine the specific CFM values for the Cheater and Cheater Beater from James' season 4 testing. Cross-reference the multiple CFM values identified (101, 84, and 224 CFM) with the contextual evidence to determine which values correspond to which device, ensuring the Cheater's CFM is higher than the Cheater Beater's CFM as confirmed in the research.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The developer successfully located James' Fan Showdown S4E10 content and extracted multiple CFM values (101, 84, 224 CFM) with high contextual confidence, (2) The research confirmed that the Cheater outperformed the Cheater Beater in CFM as stated in the TASK, but we need to determine which specific CFM value corresponds to each device, (3) Expected outcome is to definitively assign the correct CFM values to each device based on the performance hierarchy confirmed in the research, (4) This completes the TASK by providing the final answer in the requested format: 'CFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater'

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 25: Arthur Morris 300+ Test innings: match captain identification before 1973-74

**Description**: Re-examine the original TASK requirements more carefully. The TASK mentions 'Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs in an innings' but the HISTORY shows we identified Greg Chappell instead. Search specifically for Test matches where Arthur Morris actually scored over 300 runs in an innings before the 1973-74 season, and identify who was the Australian captain in that specific match. Focus on Arthur Morris's career highlights, his highest Test scores, and any 300+ run innings he achieved.

**Use Cases**:
- Cricket archive verification and captain identification for sports historians analyzing historical Test match performances
- Automated fact-checking of player achievements in digital newsrooms to validate claims like ‚Äú300+ runs in an innings‚Äù
- Academic research audit of JSON-formatted search results for extracting and summarizing cricket career highlights in journal articles
- Business data quality checks in sports analytics pipelines to detect anomalies (e.g., missing captain info or improbable score entries)
- SEO performance auditing of cricket content by analyzing search logs JSON for query success rates and relevance improvements
- Compliance reporting automation for sports governing bodies, parsing match metadata to ensure accurate leadership and scoring details
- ETL pipeline validation in sports data warehouses, flagging inconsistent or erroneous JSON fields before BI dashboard updates
- Custom anomaly alert system for editorial teams to detect and review unusual statistical claims (like individual 300+ runs) in real time

### Development Step 58: Count Unique Survivor Winners from survivor_winners_list.json

**Description**: Count the number of distinct winner names in workspace/survivor_winners_list.json and report the unique Survivor winner count.

**Use Cases**:
- Automating a TV network‚Äôs content pipeline by counting unique Survivor champions from scraped JSON to update the official winners archive on their website
- Powering a subscriber newsletter for a streaming service that highlights how many distinct Survivor winners there have been across all seasons
- Enabling a market research team to track winner diversity over time by feeding the unique winner count into their demographic analysis dashboard
- Validating the integrity of scraped reality-show data in a data engineering workflow by comparing expected versus actual unique winner counts
- Generating question pools for a trivia mobile app by extracting and de-duplicating Survivor winner names to ensure each quiz uses fresh, unique options
- Assisting a media studies researcher in preparing an academic paper by providing a clean count of distinct Survivor champions for statistical reporting
- Driving a social media bot that posts ‚ÄúDid you know?‚Äù Survivor facts by automatically referencing the latest number of unique winners
- Feeding a visualization tool that creates word clouds of Survivor winner names, ensuring only one instance of each champion appears in the graphic

### Development Step 14: Check START Cell‚Äôs Two-Cell Cardinal Neighbors‚Äô Display Text and Hex Fill Colors

**Description**: Inspect workspace/grid_data.json entries for the four cardinal two-cell neighbor coordinates of the START cell by locating the coordinates (start_x¬±2, start_y) and (start_x, start_y¬±2) based on the recorded START position in workspace/start_end_coordinates.json; report each neighbor‚Äôs displayed text and 6-digit hex fill color to verify which moves from START are actually legal.

**Use Cases**:
- Autonomous warehouse navigation and rack clearance verification, checking two-bin-away grid cells from the forklift‚Äôs start position to ensure safe travel paths.
- Robotics competition maze solver, evaluating two-step cardinal moves from the entry cell to identify viable corridors and wall-free zones for path planning.
- Board game AI for a custom ‚Äútwo-square‚Äù mover piece, scanning cells at (x¬±2, y) and (x, y¬±2) to validate legal moves and color-coded threat areas.
- Pharmaceutical high-throughput screening grid analysis, extracting assay well labels and hex color readouts two wells away from a control sample.
- GIS-based wildfire spread modeling, sampling vegetation density and hex-coded risk levels at two-cell offsets from current fire-start coordinates.
- Pixel-art editing tool that reports text labels and 6-digit hex fill colors of pixels exactly two units away from a selected start pixel for precise color transformations.
- Automated aerial drone flight planner over farmland plots, verifying crop health indicators and color-coded NDVI values at two-field offsets from the launch point.

### Development Step 41: Identify shared critical word in two authors‚Äô quotes from Midkiff‚Äôs June 2014 Fafnir article

**Description**: Access Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the Fafnir journal to extract the full text and identify the specific word that was quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions. Parse the article content systematically to locate quotes from multiple authors that contain the same critical word about dragon portrayals.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic literature review automation for humanities scholars to extract and compare thematic criticisms across multiple authors in journal articles
- Journalism editorial workflow to scan interview transcripts and flag identical impactful quotes used by different sources
- Legal e-discovery processing to identify repeated objectionable terms quoted by multiple witnesses in deposition transcripts
- E-commerce customer feedback analysis to find the same critical word appearing in reviews from different users, highlighting recurring product pain points
- Pharmaceutical safety monitoring to detect a common adverse event descriptor quoted in separate case reports for regulatory reporting
- Cyber threat intelligence gathering to uncover recurring codewords or phrases used by distinct threat actors in intercepted communications
- Publishing quality assurance to scan author submissions for duplicated editorial comments or critiques across different chapters or manuscripts
