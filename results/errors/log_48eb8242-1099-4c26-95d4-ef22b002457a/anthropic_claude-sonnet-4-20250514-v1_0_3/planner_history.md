    "plan": 'Search for and access the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database to locate records of nonindigenous crocodile species found in Florida between 2000 and 2020. Extract all relevant crocodile occurrence records from this time period, including species identification, collection dates, locations, and specimen counts. Focus on identifying the total number of individual nonindigenous crocodiles documented in Florida during this 21-year timeframe.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to locate and access the official USGS NAS database which contains comprehensive records of nonindigenous aquatic species occurrences in the United States, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this specific query, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the database structure and extract crocodile occurrence records from Florida with dates between 2000-2020, (4) This directly targets the specific data source mentioned in the TASK and provides the foundation for counting nonindigenous crocodiles found in Florida during the specified time period',

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive analysis performed by the developer: (1) The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database was successfully accessed and searched for all crocodilian species records in Florida between 2000-2020, (2) A total of 8 crocodilian species were identified in the database, with 2 species having documented occurrences in Florida during the specified timeframe, (3) All occurrence records were extracted and filtered by date range, revealing 13 individual specimens across 13 occurrence records, (4) The species breakdown shows 11 Common Caiman (Caiman crocodilus) specimens and 2 Morelet's Crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii) specimens found in various Florida counties including Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach between 2005-2019. Final answer: 13 nonindigenous crocodiles were found in Florida from 2000 through 2020 according to USGS NAS database records.",
