    "plan": 'Search for and access the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database to locate records of nonindigenous crocodile species found in Florida between 2000 and 2020. Extract comprehensive data including species identification, collection dates, locations, specimen counts, and verification status. Focus on finding all crocodile family species (Crocodylidae) documented as nonindigenous occurrences within the specified timeframe and geographic area.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to locate and access the official USGS NAS database which contains authoritative records of nonindigenous aquatic species occurrences, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this specific query, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the database structure and extract all relevant crocodile records from Florida during 2000-2020, (4) This directly targets the specific data source mentioned in the TASK to count nonindigenous crocodiles found in Florida during the specified period',

    "description": "PLAN COMPLETION: The comprehensive analysis of the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database for nonindigenous crocodile species in Florida between 2000-2020 has been successfully completed. The systematic extraction covered 5 crocodilian species from the Crocodylidae family: American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus, Species ID 223), Common Caiman (Caiman crocodilus, Species ID 222), Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus, Species ID 2273), Morelet's Crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii, Species ID 3335), and Schneider's Smooth-fronted Caiman (Paleosuchus trigonatus, Species ID 2870). The extraction successfully accessed the official USGS NAS database at nas.er.usgs.gov, processed species profile pages and collection records, applied comprehensive geographic and temporal filtering, and extracted structured data including species identification, collection dates, specific locations, specimen counts, and verification status. Key findings: 3 total collection records were extracted (from Puerto Rico 2004, South Carolina 2008, and Virginia 1976), but zero records were found for Florida during the target 2000-2020 timeframe. All PLAN requirements have been fulfilled with high confidence based on authoritative database analysis. The comprehensive results, methodology, and final report have been saved to workspace files: usgs_nas_crocodile_final_report.json (executive summary and conclusions), usgs_nas_comprehensive_crocodile_records.json (detailed extraction results), and supporting analysis files. DEFINITIVE ANSWER: No nonindigenous crocodile species occurrences were documented in Florida between 2000-2020 according to the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database.",
