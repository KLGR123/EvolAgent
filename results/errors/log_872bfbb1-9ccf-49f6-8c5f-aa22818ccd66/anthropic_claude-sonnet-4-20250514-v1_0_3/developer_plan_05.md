# Developer Plan 05

## Plan
Analyze the October 1949 breakfast menu findings from the SS Île de France to determine if any of the fruits identified in Janet Fish's 2008 painting 'Embroidery from Uzbekistan' (bananas, watermelon, pears, lemons) were served as part of the breakfast offerings. Cross-reference the menu items found by the developer with the fruit list from the painting analysis, and if any matches are found, provide them in clockwise order starting from the 12 o'clock position as determined from the painting analysis.

## Description
This is the final analytical step because: (1) We have successfully identified all fruits in the 2008 painting (bananas at 12 o'clock, watermelon at 2 o'clock, pears at 7 o'clock, lemons at 8 o'clock), (2) We confirmed SS Île de France as the ocean liner used in 'The Last Voyage', (3) The developer located the October 1949 breakfast menu showing items like 'Broiled Kipper à l'Anglaise' and 'Omelet with Cheese', (4) Expected outcome is to determine if any fruits from the painting were actually served on the breakfast menu and provide the final answer in the required clockwise format

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Family Reunion Attendance Analysis and Potato Needs in 5-Pound Bags

**Description**: Systematically analyze the family reunion attendee list to determine the exact number of adults and children attending. Parse through each family group mentioned: (1) Your parents (married mother and father), (2) Your twin brother and his family (brother + spouse + 2 children), (3) Your aunt and her family (aunt + spouse + 1 six-year-old), (4) Your grandma and her brother, (5) Her brother's daughter and her family (daughter + spouse + 3 kids under 12), plus yourself. Account for the deceased members (grandpa and grandma's sister-in-law) and the special dietary restriction (second cousins don't eat carbs). Calculate total potato consumption using the given rates: 1.5 potatoes per adult, 0.5 potatoes per child (except carb-free second cousins), convert to pounds using 0.5 pounds per potato, and determine how many 5-pound bags are needed.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate retreat catering and side-dish provisioning for a multinational team with low-carb and child-friendly meal options
- Summer camp weekly meal planning and potato supply calculation for campers, counselors, and gluten-free participants
- Wedding reception menu and ingredient ordering automation accounting for adults, children, and guests with dietary restrictions
- School field trip lunch box assembly and snack pack distribution for students with allergen exclusions and teacher chaperones
- Hospital inpatient meal scheduling and tuber-based side dish forecasting across adult and pediatric wards with diabetic diet exclusions
- Military training camp mess hall resource forecasting and bulk potato ordering considering soldiers and trainees on low‐carb rations
- Non-profit community soup kitchen stock planning and vegetable procurement tailored to adult visitors, families, and carb-free volunteers
- Restaurant chain brunch service potato side dish inventory management and automated ordering report generation for multiple locations

### Development Step 8: Title:  
Extract and Cross-Reference Unique Food Items from CATEGORIES XML Section to Identify Single-Occurrence Entry

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached XML file data/gaia/2023/validation/9b54f9d9-35ee-4a14-b62f-d130ea00317f/CATEGORIES.xml to extract all text elements under the CATEGORIES section. Examine the structure and content of each category element to understand how foods are organized. Then cross-reference the three unique food items identified from the spreadsheet analysis ('goat meat', 'mutton', and 'turtle soup') against the XML categories to determine which specific text element would contain the one food that appears only once in the spreadsheet without duplicates.

**Use Cases**:
- Food safety auditing in restaurants by cross-referencing menu items against regulated food categories to identify rare or unique dishes for compliance checks
- Nutritional epidemiology research analyzing dietary survey spreadsheets and categorizing rare food entries using standardized XML food taxonomies
- Automated menu digitization for food delivery apps, ensuring unique or uncommon dishes are correctly mapped to their XML-based category for accurate filtering and search
- Quality assurance in food manufacturing by validating ingredient lists against XML category files to flag unusual or one-off ingredients for further review
- Cultural heritage documentation projects cataloging traditional recipes, using XML category parsing to identify and highlight unique regional dishes in digital archives
- Supply chain analytics for grocery retailers, matching inventory spreadsheets with XML food categories to detect and track rare or specialty items for targeted promotions
- Regulatory compliance in import/export of food products, cross-referencing shipment manifests with XML food categories to identify and document rare foods subject to special regulations
- Data integration in hospital meal planning systems, ensuring that unique dietary items from patient records are correctly categorized using XML food taxonomies for allergy and nutrition management

### Development Step 1: Ice Cream Product Image Analysis: Extract Brand, Name, Nutrition, Ingredients, Serving Size, Butterfat Content

**Description**: Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/b2c257e0-3ad7-4f05-b8e3-d9da973be36e.jpg to identify and extract information about the ice cream product, including any visible nutrition labels, ingredient lists, or butterfat content specifications. Look for product name, brand, serving size, and any fat content information that might be displayed on the packaging.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated quality assurance for food manufacturers to verify that ice cream packaging displays accurate nutrition and ingredient information before products are shipped to retailers
- Regulatory compliance checks for food safety inspectors who need to confirm that butterfat content and labeling meet legal standards by analyzing product images from factory floors
- Retail inventory digitization for grocery chains, enabling staff to quickly extract and catalog detailed product specs (brand, flavor, nutrition) from shelf images for online store listings
- Consumer health app integration, allowing users to scan ice cream packaging and receive instant, detailed breakdowns of nutrition facts and ingredients for dietary tracking
- Competitive product benchmarking for market analysts comparing fat content, ingredients, and nutritional claims across multiple ice cream brands using shelf or marketing images
- Automated product recall identification, where food safety teams analyze packaging images to detect specific batch numbers, allergens, or ingredient changes in response to recalls
- Academic research in food science, enabling researchers to collect and analyze large datasets of ingredient lists and nutritional profiles from diverse ice cream products for trend analysis
- Visual merchandising audits for brand managers, who use extracted label data from in-store photos to verify correct product placement, branding, and compliance with promotional standards

### Development Step 2: Extract and Categorize Fast-Food Menu Sales from Excel, Prepare Food-Only Sales Totals

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/7bd855d8-463d-4ed5-93ca-5fe35145f733.xlsx to extract all sales data for the fast-food chain menu items. Identify the structure of the spreadsheet including column headers, data organization, and categorize menu items to distinguish between food items and drinks. Extract sales figures for each item and prepare the data for calculating total food sales excluding beverages.

**Use Cases**:
- Multi-location franchise performance benchmarking: aggregate and compare food vs beverage sales across outlets to identify top-performing restaurants and underperforming regions
- Inventory procurement optimization for supply chain teams: parse POS export spreadsheets to compute accurate demand for burgers, salads, fries, etc., excluding beverages to streamline restocking orders
- Financial auditing and compliance reporting for hospitality accountants: automatically extract and categorize sales figures from daily sales logs to generate audit trails and tax reports focusing on taxable food items
- Menu engineering and dynamic pricing analysis for marketing managers: analyze historical sales volume per menu category to adjust pricing, promotions, and product placement for maximizing food item revenue excluding drinks
- Demand forecasting and supply planning for operations teams: ingest weekly Excel sales exports, aggregate item-level food sales excluding beverages, and feed into forecasting models for ingredient ordering
- Loyalty program ROI assessment for CRM platforms: extract item-level sales data by location to measure uplift in food purchases during targeted promotions or discount campaigns, excluding beverage sales
- Business intelligence dashboard integration for executive reporting: transform raw Excel sales data into structured JSON and text summaries for real-time ingestion into BI tools to visualize food-only revenue trends across all outlets
- Competitive benchmarking and market analysis for consultancy firms: use categorized sales data to compare menu performance against industry benchmarks and advise clients on menu mix optimization
