# Developer Plan 03

## Plan
Search for information about which ocean liner was used as a floating prop for the film 'The Last Voyage' to identify the specific ship. Focus on finding details about the movie production, filming locations, and which actual ocean liner was converted or used for the movie set. Look for film production notes, maritime history sources, and movie databases that document the ship used in this film.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified the fruits in the 2008 painting (bananas, watermelon, pears, lemons) and their clockwise arrangement, (2) Now we need to identify which ocean liner was used in 'The Last Voyage' film before we can research its October 1949 breakfast menu, (3) Expected outcome is to determine the specific ship name that served as the floating prop, (4) This advances us toward the second major component of the multi-part TASK by establishing which ocean liner's breakfast menu we need to research

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Goldfinger (1964) Finale Concealment Objects and Colors Used by Bond and Pussy Galore

**Description**: Search for detailed information about the ending of the 1964 James Bond film 'Goldfinger' starring Sean Connery. Focus specifically on the final scenes where James Bond and Pussy Galore (played by Honor Blackman) take cover or conceal themselves. Look for descriptions of any objects they use for concealment, paying particular attention to the colors of these objects. Search multiple sources including movie databases (IMDb, Wikipedia), film reviews, plot summaries, and James Bond fan sites to ensure accuracy of the color details.

**Use Cases**:
- Film archive metadata tagging and color-based object recognition for streaming platforms to improve searchability of classic James Bond scenes
- Auction house prop verification and provenance research by extracting detailed descriptions (color, object type) of memorabilia from historical film endings
- Academic film studies research to analyze gendered concealment tactics and color symbolism in 1960s spy movies using automated search and keyword extraction
- Pop culture blog automation for generating in-depth scene breakdowns of iconic movie finales (e.g., Goldfinger) highlighting props and color details
- Guided tour content creation for movie location tours (e.g., Fort Knox) incorporating narrative of final scenes and specific object/color references
- Trivia app question generation focusing on memorable film details (e.g., color of the parachute James Bond hides under) by scraping multiple online sources
- Museum exhibit cataloging of cinematic artifacts, using color and object data extraction to curate displays on 1960s espionage film memorabilia
- Marketing analysis for product placement impact in classic films, identifying mentions of branded or colored props (parachutes, vehicles) in final scenes

### Development Step 5: Identify 2020 Documentary Title, Composer, and Director of ‘Run Home Slow’ 1963 B-Movie Score

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the 2020 documentary that includes archival footage from the 1960s and focuses on a composer who wrote the soundtrack for the 1963 B movie 'Run Home Slow'. Search for keywords including '2020 documentary archival footage 1960s composer', 'Run Home Slow 1963 B movie soundtrack composer', 'documentary 2020 composer 1960s footage', and 'Run Home Slow soundtrack who composed'. Focus on identifying both the specific 2020 documentary title and the composer it focuses on, as well as the director of this documentary.

**Use Cases**:
- Film festival programming and metadata extraction for selecting and curating archival-footage documentaries
- Musicology academic research and composer-focused source analysis for scholarly publications
- Streaming platform metadata enrichment and release-year correction for documentary catalogs
- Legal due diligence workflow for verifying director and composer credits in film licensing agreements
- Journalism fact-checking and automated film attribute extraction for documentary reviews and press articles
- University film studies curriculum development and archival footage content mapping for course materials
- Library archiving and cataloging automation for accurate film metadata and archival resource tracking
- Marketing analytics for film distributors monitoring 2020 documentary mentions featuring specific composers

### Development Step 2: Investigate Goldfinger’s Final Scenes: Bond and Pussy Galore’s Concealment Objects and Their Colors

**Description**: Search for detailed information about the ending of the 1964 James Bond film 'Goldfinger' starring Sean Connery. Focus specifically on the final scenes where James Bond and Pussy Galore (played by Honor Blackman) take cover or conceal themselves. Look for descriptions of any objects they use for concealment, paying particular attention to the colors of these objects. Search multiple sources including movie databases (IMDb, Wikipedia), film reviews, plot summaries, and James Bond fan sites to ensure accuracy of the color details.

**Use Cases**:
- Film preservation and restoration teams verifying accurate color data of props and costumes to guide digital color correction processes
- Cinema studies researchers automating detailed scene analysis, such as identifying prop colors in specific film segments for academic papers on color symbolism
- Streaming platforms enriching metadata by automatically extracting visual details (e.g., parachute colors) from movie endings to improve search and recommendation features
- Film trivia and fan site editors aggregating precise color information about iconic scenes for creating authoritative guides and trivia databases
- Production designers benchmarking historical prop and costume color palettes for period-accurate set designs based on classic movie references
- Digital archivists organizing and tagging archived movie content with fine-grained visual descriptors (prop color data) to enhance archival retrieval systems
- Machine learning engineers constructing annotated datasets of film visuals, including object color labels, for training computer vision models to recognize objects in movie scenes
- Entertainment journalists fact-checking visual elements of classic films when writing retrospective articles or anniversary features to ensure accurate reporting

Focus on identifying both the specific 2020 documentary title and the composer it focuses on, as well as the director of this documentary.

**Use Cases**:
- Archival film researcher verifying the composer and director details of a 1963 B-movie soundtrack for a museum retrospective
- Music licensing manager tracing rights holders of obscure 1960s film scores to secure streaming permissions
- Documentary producer sourcing background on a mid-century composer and archival footage for a new film project
- University film studies professor compiling a case study on 1960s B-movies and their music for a lecture series
- Film festival curator contextualizing archival materials and composer profiles in a 2020 retrospective lineup
- Legal team for a media company confirming public domain status of a 1963 soundtrack before re-release
- Digital archivist enriching metadata in an online film repository with documentary titles, composers, and directors
- Independent journalist researching forgotten film composers and their documentaries for a published feature article
