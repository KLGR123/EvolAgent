# Planner History

## Execution History
```
{
    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": "Search for and access the English Wikipedia article about 'Lego' to find the latest version from 2022. Use web search or direct Wikipedia access to locate the Lego article, then identify the specific revision that represents the latest version from 2022 (likely from late December 2022). Once the correct 2022 version is accessed, systematically count all images present in the article content, including photographs, diagrams, logos, and any other visual media embedded within the article text.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify and access the specific 2022 version of the Lego Wikipedia article rather than the current version, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this image counting task, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the correct 2022 article version and extract all embedded images for counting, (4) This directly addresses the TASK requirement to determine the exact number of images in the latest 2022 version of the Lego English Wikipedia article.',

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. The previous implementation fully achieved all PLAN objectives: (1) Successfully located and accessed the latest 2022 version of the English Wikipedia Lego article (revision ID: 1128616160 from December 21, 2022), (2) Retrieved the complete wiki markup content (77,350 characters), (3) Systematically counted all images using regex pattern matching for [[File:...]] and [[Image:...]] markup, (4) Identified and catalogued 12 total images including 10 JPG photographs, 1 SVG logo, and 1 PNG diagram. The analysis produced comprehensive documentation including detailed image inventory with filenames, parameters, captions, and file type categorization. All results were saved to workspace files: revision info (JSON), raw wiki content (TXT), detailed image analysis (JSON), and human-readable summary report (TXT). The tester confirmed 100% PLAN alignment with no errors and no further development needed. Final answer: 12 images were found in the latest 2022 version of the Lego Wikipedia article.',
