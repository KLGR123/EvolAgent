Identify all ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) identifiers contained in the file, then prepare for subsequent analysis of their public profiles to count pre-2020 works. Extract the complete list of researcher IDs and examine the file structure to understand the data format and any additional metadata that might be relevant for the ORCID profile analysis.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the JSON-LD file structure and extract all researcher ORCID identifiers before we can analyze their profiles, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have a complete list of researcher IDs and understanding of the data structure, (4) This provides the foundation needed to subsequently access ORCID profiles and count pre-2020 works for calculating the average as requested in the TASK',

The implementation achieved all specified requirements: (1) Successfully parsed the JSON-LD file data/gaia/2023/validation/bec74516-02fc-48dc-b202-55e78d0e17cf.jsonld, (2) Extracted complete list of 5 unique ORCID identifiers from researchers (0000-0003-0396-0333, 0000-0002-2605-6569, 0000-0001-6102-7846, 0000-0002-0209-2784, 0000-0002-1053-2030), (3) Thoroughly examined file structure revealing it as a schema.org Collection about 'GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR THE CONSERVATION OF POTATO' published in 2022, (4) Identified researcher roles (1 author + 4 editors with ORCIDs), (5) Prepared clean, structured data files in workspace for subsequent ORCID profile analysis. The code properly handled the JSON-LD format, removed duplicates from initial extraction, and created comprehensive output files including researcher details, publication context, and metadata. All ORCID identifiers are now ready for the next phase of pre-2020 works analysis via public ORCID API queries. No further development is needed for this extraction phase as all PLAN objectives have been successfully completed and verified by testing.",

For each researcher, query their ORCID profile to extract all works/publications with publication dates, then count how many works were published before 2020.
