# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Parse and analyze the attached JSON-LD file data/gaia/2023/validation/bec74516-02fc-48dc-b202-55e78d0e17cf.jsonld to extract researcher identification information. Identify all people and their corresponding ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) identifiers from the file structure. Extract the complete list of researcher IDs that will be used to query their ORCID profiles for pre-2020 publication counts.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the JSON-LD file structure and extract all researcher identification data before we can access their ORCID profiles, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have a complete list of researcher ORCID IDs that we can use to query their publication records, (4) This provides the foundation needed to eventually calculate the average number of pre-2020 works across all researchers as requested in the TASK

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 16: Identify Surrey Lodge Developer Organization and Founder’s Birth Year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogical research firms automating founder identification from archival JSON and text repositories to accelerate validation of family lineage linked to fraternal organizations
- Museum curation teams extracting organizational founders and establishment dates for Victorian-era societies to enrich exhibit metadata and digital collections
- Legal due diligence platforms verifying historical property ownership by parsing research files for founders’ names and birth years in heritage estate transactions
- Academic historians running automated pipelines to cross-validate digital research outputs and generate structured biographies of 18th-century society founders
- Cultural heritage mobile apps ingesting verified JSON outputs to display founder biographies and lodge histories for self-guided Victorian-era sightseeing tours
- Nonprofit grant writers compiling evidence-backed organizational backgrounds and founder details to strengthen funding applications for preservation projects
- Digital humanities platforms integrating structured data on fraternal lodges and founders into linked open data knowledge graphs for public research
- Historical preservation consultants generating compliance-ready reports by extracting and summarizing key organizational and founder information from research artifacts

### Development Step 15: Identify Surrey Lodge’s Developing Organization, Its Founder, and the Founder’s Birth Year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum curation automation: Extracting founder names and birth years from archival JSON and text files to enrich exhibition catalogs on Victorian fraternal societies
- Genealogical research workflows: Parsing family archive data and performing targeted web searches to confirm ancestor birth dates and organizational roles
- Academic history projects: Integrating disparate research results and online biographical sources to compile detailed profiles of 18th-century organization founders
- Cultural heritage management: Synthesizing local council research and web-based historical records to document building founders and secure preservation grants
- E-learning content generation: Auto-creating concise founder biographies and timelines from raw research documents for interactive history modules
- Publishing fact-checking pipelines: Validating historical details—such as founder identities and birth years—for books on London’s Victorian era societies
- Legal due-diligence support: Combining JSON research data with targeted online searches to verify heritage property lineage and founder information in transaction reports
- Digital archive enhancement: Tagging metadata in historical building records with organization affiliations and founder birth years to improve searchability and access

### Development Step 10: Analyze Surrey Lodge research data to find its developer organization, founder, and founder’s birth year

**Description**: Analyze the comprehensive research data saved in workspace/surrey_lodge_research_results.json and workspace/surrey_lodge_summary_report.txt to identify the specific organization that developed Surrey Lodge and determine who founded that organization. Extract the founder's name from the research findings, then conduct a targeted biographical search to find their birth year. Focus on connecting the Victorian-era development of Surrey Lodge to its founding organization and the individual who established it.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical property due diligence: automatically scanning municipal archives and research outputs to identify the original developer company and founder’s birth year for real estate investment reports
- Heritage architecture exhibit curation: extracting organization background and founder biographical details from text and JSON research files to draft museum display panels on Victorian-era buildings
- Genealogy service enrichment: processing family history research data to pinpoint who established a family-run society or firm and retrieve their birth year for detailed lineage profiles
- Academic literature review automation: ingesting JSON and text summaries of historical studies to compile key metadata (organization, founder, development dates) for Victorian urban development theses
- Business intelligence reporting: analyzing competitor historical documentation to uncover the founding organization and its founder’s birth year for strategic market entry assessments
- Cultural heritage conservation planning: harvesting structured research and summary reports to connect heritage sites’ developers with individual founders, supporting grant applications and preservation bids
- Digital archive keyword analysis: performing targeted term counts in research datasets to map out focus areas (organization, founder, development) and generate concise summary reports for cultural resource management teams

### Development Step 7: Title:  
Download and Extract Full Content of Galactic Center Filaments Paper for NASA Award Number Details

**Description**: Access the research paper at https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acd54b titled 'The Population of the Galactic Center Filaments: Position Angle Distribution Reveals a Degree-scale Collimated Outflow from Sgr A* along the Galactic Plane' and download it to the workspace folder. Extract the full paper content including author information, acknowledgments section, and funding details to locate R. G. Arendt's NASA award number information.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated extraction of grant and funding information from astrophysics research papers for university research administration to streamline grant tracking and compliance reporting
- Bibliometric analysis of author-specific funding sources across large corpora of scientific literature for research impact assessment and funding agency audits
- Rapid identification of NASA award numbers associated with specific researchers (e.g., R. G. Arendt) for inclusion in annual grant progress reports or renewal applications
- Integration into digital library systems to enrich metadata with author funding details, improving search and discovery for grant-funded research outputs
- Automated compliance checking for open access repositories to verify that required funding acknowledgments and award numbers are present in deposited manuscripts
- Extraction of acknowledgments and funding data for science journalists investigating the financial landscape and collaboration networks in space science research
- Supporting automated CV or biosketch generation tools for researchers by programmatically retrieving and listing their grant numbers from published papers
- Enabling research office staff to quickly compile lists of publications supported by specific NASA awards for reporting to agency sponsors or institutional leadership
