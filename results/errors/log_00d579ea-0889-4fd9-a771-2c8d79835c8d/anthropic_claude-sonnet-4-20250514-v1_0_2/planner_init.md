## Task
Assuming scientists in the famous youtube video The Thinking Machine (Artificial Intelligence in the 1960s) were interviewed the same year, what is the name of the scientist predicting the sooner thinking machines or robots? Answer using the format First name Last name

## Episodic Examples
### **Title:**  
Identify a society-type label shared between a 2022 AI regulation paper and a 2016 Physics and Society article on arXiv.

**TASK**: A paper about AI regulation that was originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022 shows a figure with three axes, where each axis has a label word at both ends. Which of these words is used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016?
