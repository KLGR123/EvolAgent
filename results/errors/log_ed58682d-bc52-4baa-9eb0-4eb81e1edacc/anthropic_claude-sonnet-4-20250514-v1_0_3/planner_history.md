## Execution History
```
{
    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": "Research and identify the King of Pop's sixth studio album, then determine which song was the fifth single released from that album. Once identified, find the complete lyrics to that song and locate the specific word that appears immediately before the second chorus begins.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the identity of the King of Pop (Michael Jackson) and his sixth studio album, (2) No previous research has been conducted based on the empty HISTORY, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific album, the fifth single from that album, and then analyze its lyrical structure, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK by systematically working through each component - identifying the artist, album, single, and then the specific lyrical position requested',
