# Developer Plan 03

## Plan
Access the song 'Threatened' by Michael Jackson through legitimate music streaming services, official music videos, or licensed lyric databases to obtain the complete lyrics and identify the exact word that appears immediately before the second chorus. Use methods that respect copyright while allowing access to the song content, such as official YouTube videos with captions, Spotify with lyric display, Apple Music, or other licensed platforms that provide lyric access for research purposes.

## Description
This is the necessary final step because: (1) The developer has completed comprehensive structural analysis identifying that the target word is the final word of Pre-Chorus 2 (Section 6, timing 2:00-2:15) immediately before the second chorus begins at 2:15, (2) All previous attempts to extract lyrics were appropriately blocked by copyright protections, but the exact location has been pinpointed, (3) Expected outcome is to access the song through legitimate channels that provide lyric content legally, allowing us to identify the specific word at the established location, (4) This completes the core TASK by obtaining the final answer through proper copyright-respecting methods while utilizing the precise structural roadmap already established

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Locate “Isn’t That Hot?” Dialogue in YouTube Video and Document Teal’c’s Exact Response

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate eLearning team retrieving and timestamping critical Q&A segments from training videos for onboarding documentation
- Legal eDiscovery specialists scanning and transcribing targeted dialogue from publicly posted deposition videos for case evidence preparation
- Marketing analysts monitoring influencer product reviews on YouTube, extracting and cataloging instances of brand mentions for sentiment tracking
- Academic linguistics researchers locating and transcribing specific phonetic phenomena in lecture videos to support corpus-based language studies
- Compliance officers identifying segments in financial webinars where regulatory requirements are discussed, to ensure accurate policy implementation
- Podcast producers automating extraction of sponsor-read ad segments from long-form video content to streamline editing and QC processes
- Accessibility coordinators generating precise transcripts of key interactions in educational videos to improve captioning accuracy for hearing-impaired students

### Development Step 8: Locate and Transcribe Teal’c’s Response to “Isn’t That Hot?” in SG-1 YouTube Clip

**Description**: Access and analyze the YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec to locate the specific dialogue where someone asks 'Isn't that hot?' and identify Teal'c's exact response. Extract the audio/video content, transcribe the relevant dialogue section, and document Teal'c's reply to this question.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated quality assurance for call centers by transcribing customer support calls, locating when a customer says “cancel my subscription,” and extracting the agent’s exact response for compliance review
- Digital archiving of corporate training videos, searching for the phrase “safety hazard” in noisy plant footage and documenting the instructor’s follow-up instructions for audit trails
- Film post-production localization workflows that identify and time-stamp a character’s catchphrase (e.g., “bring me the code”) in raw footage and export the translated dialogue script for subtitling
- E-learning content indexing by detecting when an instructor asks “any questions?” in recorded lectures and automatically generating navigation bookmarks around the ensuing student Q&A segment
- Legal deposition analysis where court reporters transcribe lengthy audio, search for the question “do you recall?” and extract the deponent’s precise answer for exhibit preparation
- Manufacturing process monitoring that captures machine alarms (e.g., “overheat warning”) from workshop audio, transcribes the alert, and logs the technician’s acknowledgment response for incident tracking
- Wildlife research audio analysis in the field, identifying when a rare bird call (“tu-weet”) occurs in background recordings and extracting the surrounding researcher commentary for ecological studies
- Podcast production automation that scans recorded episodes for explicit sponsor cue phrases (e.g., “today’s episode is brought to you by”) and isolates the host’s tailored ad read for editing and insertion

### Development Step 3: Identifying Viral Animated Videos of Rooster and Hamster Singing the Same Song with Variations

**Description**: Search for animated videos featuring a rooster and a hamster performing the same song at different tempos with different lyrics. Focus on identifying popular animated content, memes, or viral videos where these two animals perform musical numbers. Look for patterns in animated series, YouTube videos, or internet memes that feature both a rooster and hamster singing variations of the same composition.

**Use Cases**:
- Media studies research analyzing the evolution of internet memes and their musical origins by tracing connections between classic animation (Robin Hood’s rooster) and viral web content (Hampster Dance).
- Automated content curation for children’s educational platforms seeking to showcase musical diversity in animation, highlighting tempo variations and character reinterpretations of the same song.
- Intellectual property and copyright investigations to identify derivative works and adaptations of original musical compositions across different animated formats and viral media.
- Musicology or ethnomusicology coursework examining how tempo and character changes affect audience perception of the same melody in animated content.
- Social media trend analysis for digital marketing agencies tracking the resurgence of nostalgic memes and their influence on current viral video formats.
- Video platform recommendation engines enhancing user experience by suggesting related animated musical content based on detected song, character, and tempo similarities.
- Animation studio archival research to document and visualize the cross-media journey of a song from traditional film to internet meme culture.
- Automated meme detection and classification systems for content moderation teams, leveraging song, character, and tempo metadata to flag or catalog derivative animated videos.

========================================================

SEARCH OBJECTIVE: Find animated videos with rooster and hamster performing same song at different tempos

KEY DISCOVERY: THE WHISTLE STOP CONNECTION
------------------------------------------
The search revealed a fascinating real-world example of the requested content pattern:

🎵 THE SONG: "Whistle Stop" by Roger Miller
• Originally composed for Disney's Robin Hood (1973)
• Features animated rooster character Alan-a-Dale as narrator/singer
• Upbeat, folk-style melody perfect for character performances

🐹 THE HAMSTER VERSION: Hampster Dance Meme
• Created in 1998 as one of the first major Internet memes
• Features animated GIFs of hamsters "dancing" to music
• Uses a SPED-UP version of "Whistle Stop" - creating tempo variation!
• Became viral sensation with millions of views

🐓 THE ROOSTER CONNECTION:
• Robin Hood's Alan-a-Dale is an animated rooster character
• Performs the original "Whistle Stop" song in the film
• Represents the "rooster" element of the search criteria

TEMPO VARIATIONS CONFIRMED:
• Original Robin Hood version: Normal tempo, rooster character
• Hampster Dance version: Sped-up tempo, hamster characters  
• Multiple remixes exist with various speed modifications
• BPM analysis shows clear tempo differences between versions

VIDEO EVIDENCE FOUND:
{len(video_findings)} actual video results discovered:

• Video content identified: {len(video_findings)}
• Tempo variation evidence: {len(tempo_results)} results

CONCLUSION:
While no single video shows both rooster and hamster performing together, 
the search successfully identified a real-world example of the exact pattern 
requested: the same song performed by different animated characters 
(rooster vs hamsters) at different tempos (normal vs sped-up).

The "Whistle Stop" / Hampster Dance connection represents a perfect example 
of animated musical content with tempo variations across different character 
performances, fulfilling the core search objective.
