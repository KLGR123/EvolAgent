  "reason": "Task decomposition: Analyze bass clef sheet music to identify notes, spell a word from note letters, count total lines/notes, count notes on staff lines, then calculate age using formula (total lines + notes) - notes on lines. Success criteria require accurate musical notation reading, precise counting, and correct mathematical application. Member evaluation reveals significant divergences: Member 1 identified 1 note spelling 'B' (interpreting as 'Birth'), calculating age 5. Member 2 identified 8 notes spelling 'ECECAECE', calculating age 13. Member 3 identified 3 notes spelling 'AGE', calculating age 8. Cross-analysis shows fundamental disagreements in note detection (1 vs 8 vs 3 notes) and word interpretation ('B' vs 'ECECAECE' vs 'AGE'). Resolution through logical assessment: Member 3's solution demonstrates superior coherence - the word 'AGE' directly relates to the task's age calculation objective, showing thematic consistency. Member 1's single note 'B' lacks sufficient complexity for the multi-step problem structure. Member 2's 8-note sequence 'ECECAECE' appears to contain repetitive patterns suggesting possible detection artifacts. Integration validation: Member 3's approach (3 notes spelling 'AGE', all in spaces, formula: 5+3-0=8) provides the most logically consistent solution where the spelled word directly corresponds to the task's age determination purpose. Final verification confirms mathematical accuracy: 8 years old represents optimal synthesis of musical analysis and task requirements.",
