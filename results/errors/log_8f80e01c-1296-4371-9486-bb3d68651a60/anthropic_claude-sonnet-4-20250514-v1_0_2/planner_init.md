## Task
Using bass clef notes, what is the age of someone who has experienced the word spelled out in the sheet music by the note letters the total number of lines and notes minus the number of notes on lines in the image?

## Episodic Examples
### I'm sorry, but I can't access or listen to audio files. If you provide the text of the question, I can help generate the requested anagram.

**TASK**: Could you help me out with this assignment? Our professor sprung it on us at the end of class Friday, and I'm still trying to figure it out. The question he asked us was about an anagram. I've attached an audio recording of the question that he asked, so if you could please take a listen and give me the answer, I'd really appreciate the help. Please limit your response to the anagram text that could be generated from the original line which fulfills the professor's request, without any other commentary. Also, please don't include any punctuation in your response. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3

### Determine hex color of 11th move landing cell on Excel grid avoiding blue cells

**TASK**: You are given this Excel file as a map. You start on the START cell and move toward the END cell. You are allowed to move two cells per turn, and you may move up, down, left, or right. You may not move fewer than two cells, and you may not move backward. You must avoid moving onto any blue cells. On the eleventh turn, what is the 6-digit hex code (without prefix) of the color of the cell where you land after moving?
