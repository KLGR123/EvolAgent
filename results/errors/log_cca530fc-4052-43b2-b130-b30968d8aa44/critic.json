  "final_answer": "Qd1+",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Analyze chess position image to identify the winning move for black in algebraic notation. All three members conducted multimodal image analysis but reached different conclusions and board interpretations. Member 1 and Member 2 both identified the winning move as Qd1+, describing a position with black queen on b3 and providing detailed tactical analysis showing how Qd1+ exploits back rank weakness with white king on g1. Their analysis demonstrates sound chess principles - back rank tactics are fundamental winning patterns. Member 3 identified Ng4+ as the winning move, describing a knight fork attacking king and rook simultaneously, but provided a different board state interpretation with knight on d4. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on both board position (FEN: 6k1/1p1p2p1/p3b3/7Q/3n4/3BR3/P1PB1PPP/6K1 b - - 0 1) and winning move (Qd1+), while Member 3 diverges significantly. Divergence resolution: Members 1 and 2 provide consistent tactical explanations about back rank weakness and pinned rook on e3, with detailed variation analysis showing if Re1 blocks, then Nf3+ wins the queen through discovered attack. This level of tactical depth and consistency suggests more accurate position analysis. Member 3's knight fork concept is tactically sound but appears to be analyzing a different position. Integration assessment: The convergence of two independent analyses on Qd1+ with detailed supporting variations provides high confidence. Back rank mate patterns are classic winning tactics that align with the described position structure.",
