# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/df6561b2-7ee5-4540-baab-5095f742716a.png to identify and extract all red numbers and green numbers visible in the image. Use optical character recognition and image analysis techniques to accurately capture the numerical values, distinguishing between red-colored and green-colored numbers based on their visual appearance.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to examine the image to identify what red and green numbers are present before we can perform any statistical calculations, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this image file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete lists of red numbers and green numbers extracted from the image, (4) This provides the foundation needed to calculate standard population deviation for red numbers and standard sample deviation for green numbers using Python's statistics module

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 4: Title: Analyze Python Script Operations on String Arrays from Provided Image File

**Description**: Extract and analyze the Python script from the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png to understand what operations it performs on string arrays.

**Use Cases**:
- Digital forensics teams extracting and reconstructing obfuscated URLs from malware samples embedded in screenshots for threat intelligence analysis
- Academic researchers recovering and analyzing code snippets from published figures or images in scientific papers to reproduce computational experiments
- Automated QA systems validating that documentation screenshots of code match the actual source code by extracting and comparing scripts
- Business analysts retrieving and verifying configuration scripts from archived image files in legacy system audits
- Cybersecurity professionals decoding and tracing suspicious links hidden in image-based phishing emails for incident response
- Software engineers reverse-engineering application logic from UI screenshots when source code is unavailable for legacy migration projects
- Compliance officers extracting and reviewing code from image-based evidence in regulatory investigations to ensure adherence to coding standards
- Data migration teams converting code embedded in image files to text for integration into modern version control systems

### Development Step 1: Visualizing Earl Smith’s Green Cells in Land Plot Excel Spreadsheet

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel spreadsheet file data/gaia/2023/validation/5cfb274c-0207-4aa7-9575-6ac0bd95d9b2.xlsx to identify all green cells representing Earl Smith's land plots. Extract the cell positions, colors, and create a visual representation of the spreadsheet layout to understand the spatial distribution of Earl's plots relative to other landowners' plots.

**Use Cases**:
- Government cadastral mapping and land registry automation by extracting color‐coded ownership plots to update digital map databases
- Real estate due diligence workflows that visualize Excel‐highlighted property parcels owned by specific investors for investment analysis
- Agricultural field management systems identifying green‐coded crop plots per farmer to optimize resource allocation and yield forecasting
- Environmental impact assessments locating green‐highlighted conservation areas within survey spreadsheets to integrate with GIS for habitat protection
- Urban planning and zoning compliance checks extracting color‐designated residential, commercial, and industrial parcels from city planning documents
- Insurance underwriting risk profiling by mapping green-shaded floodplain or landslide-prone zones in survey workbooks for policy pricing
- Infrastructure project land acquisition tracking by compiling Excel‐flagged stakeholder parcels into visual layouts for negotiation and planning
- Legal boundary dispute resolution supporting attorneys in extracting lawyer‐marked colored cells representing contested lot lines to prepare court exhibits

### Development Step 5: Title: Analyze Python Script in Image for String Array Operations and Functionality

**Description**: Extract and analyze the Python script from the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png to understand what operations it performs on string arrays.

**Use Cases**:
- Digital archiving and restoration of legacy web pages by reconstructing URLs from obfuscated string arrays in historical datasets
- Automated validation of data integrity in migration projects by extracting and verifying URLs encoded within image-based Python scripts
- Cybersecurity incident investigation by decoding suspicious URL patterns embedded in code screenshots recovered from compromised machines
- Educational tool for teaching reverse engineering and code analysis, allowing students to extract and interpret logic from image-based scripts
- Legal e-discovery workflows where evidence is stored as screenshots of code, enabling analysts to reconstruct and analyze hidden web links
- Automated monitoring of competitor website changes by extracting and following reconstructed archive URLs from shared code snippets
- Digital forensics for recovering lost or deleted web resources by analyzing image files containing code that encodes access URLs
- Compliance auditing in regulated industries by extracting and verifying reference links from image-based documentation containing Python scripts

### Development Step 1: Title: Analyze Python Script from Image for String Array Operations and Functionality

**Description**: Extract and analyze the Python script from the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/b7f857e4-d8aa-4387-af2a-0e844df5b9d8.png to understand what operations it performs on string arrays.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated extraction and analysis of Python scripts from screenshots for software documentation teams
- Quality assurance in software development by validating code snippets embedded in image-based bug reports
- Educational content digitization by converting textbook images containing Python exercises into editable code for e-learning platforms
- Legal compliance audits by extracting and reviewing code from image evidence in intellectual property cases
- Data migration for legacy systems by retrieving and analyzing code stored as images in old archives
- Research reproducibility checks by extracting and verifying Python code from published figures in scientific papers
- Cybersecurity incident response by analyzing code samples found in screenshots during forensic investigations
- Streamlining technical support by automatically extracting and diagnosing code errors from user-submitted screenshots
