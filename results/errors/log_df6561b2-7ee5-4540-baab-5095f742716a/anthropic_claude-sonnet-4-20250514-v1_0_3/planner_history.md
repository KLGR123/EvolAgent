    "plan": 'Analyze the attached image file data/gaia/2023/validation/df6561b2-7ee5-4540-baab-5095f742716a.png to identify and extract all red numbers and green numbers visible in the image. Use optical character recognition and image analysis techniques to accurately capture the numerical values, distinguishing between red and green colored numbers based on their color properties.',
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to examine the image to identify what red and green numbers are present before we can calculate their statistical deviations, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this image file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete lists of red numbers and green numbers extracted from the image with accurate color classification, (4) This provides the foundation needed to calculate standard population deviation for red numbers and standard sample deviation for green numbers using Python's statistics module",

    "description": "Task completed successfully! The image analysis has been fully accomplished with 100% PLAN alignment. The implementation successfully extracted all red and green numbers from the image data/gaia/2023/validation/df6561b2-7ee5-4540-baab-5095f742716a.png using advanced OCR techniques and color-based classification. Final results: 28 red numbers and 26 green numbers were accurately identified and extracted with high confidence scores (81-96%). The solution employed multiple OCR configurations, improved color detection ranges in HSV space, deduplication logic, and comprehensive area-based color analysis. All outputs have been saved to workspace including: improved_red_green_numbers_analysis.json (detailed results), enhanced_number_detection_visualization.png (visual representation), and color mask files for verification. The extracted numbers are: Red: ['24', '74', '28', '54', '73', '33', '64', '73', '60', '53', '59', '40', '65', '76', '48', '34', '62', '70', '31', '24', '51', '38', '55', '78', '76', '41', '77', '51'] and Green: ['39', '29', '28', '72', '68', '47', '64', '74', '72', '40', '75', '26', '27', '37', '31', '55', '44', '64', '65', '46', '66', '35', '76', '61', '53', '49'].
