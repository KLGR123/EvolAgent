    "description": "This implementation conducts comprehensive research to identify the National Air and Space Museum location east of the Potomac River in Washington DC. The approach uses multiple research phases: (1) Direct access to official Smithsonian Air and Space Museum websites to gather location information, addresses, and visitor details, (2) Google Search API queries targeting specific location and Metro station information, (3) Systematic analysis of collected data to identify location patterns and Metro access points. The code searches for key indicators like 'Udvar-Hazy', 'Chantilly', 'Virginia', and Metro station references across all sources. Based on geographical knowledge that the National Mall (main museum) is west of the Potomac, the research focuses on identifying the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia as the likely candidate for the museum 'east of the Potomac River'. The implementation saves all HTML content, extracted text, and search results to workspace files for detailed analysis, then compiles findings into a comprehensive research summary with conclusions about the specific museum location and nearest Metro station access.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - The code appears to have a significant bug where it's executing a completely different task than intended. The **PLAN** requires researching National Air and Space Museum locations east of the Potomac River and finding Metro stations, but the **CURRENT CODE OUTPUT** shows the script searching for 'Eva Draconis websites' and analyzing 'curved line symbols in banners' instead. This is a fundamental mismatch between the code logic and the stated objective. The code did successfully access some Smithsonian museum websites and extracted valuable location data (finding Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA with address 14390 Air and Space Museum Parkway), but then diverted to an unrelated Eva Draconis search task. **PLAN** alignment: 30% - partial museum data collected but wrong task executed. Immediate fix needed: Remove the Eva Draconis search logic and focus the code exclusively on analyzing the successfully collected Air and Space Museum location data to complete the original research objective.",

    "description": "This implementation analyzes the successfully collected museum data from the previous research phase to complete the original objective. The code inspects the museum location text files that were saved to the workspace, extracting key information about addresses, location indicators, and Metro station details. It systematically searches for patterns indicating the Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, counts mentions of key location terms (Chantilly, Udvar-Hazy, Virginia, Dulles), and identifies specific addresses like '14390 Air and Space Museum Parkway'. The analysis confirms that the Steven F.

    "description": "This implementation conducts comprehensive research to locate Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting at Reagan National Airport) and Cleveland Elementary School in the Washington DC area, then determines their nearest Metro stations and connections to the Silver Line system. The approach uses multiple phases: (1) Targeted Google searches for Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF using specific aviation and airport terminology, (2) Comprehensive searches for Cleveland Elementary School in the Washington DC area, (3) Metro system research focusing on Silver Line connections, and (4) Geographical analysis combining search results with known Metro system layout. The code identifies Fire Station 301 as being located at Reagan National Airport (DCA) in Arlington, Virginia, served by the Blue and Yellow Metro lines at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station. For Cleveland Elementary School, it determines the location is in Washington DC with various Metro access points. Both locations can connect to the Silver Line (which serves Dulles Airport) via downtown DC transfer stations like Metro Center and L'Enfant Plaza. All findings are saved to comprehensive JSON files for detailed analysis and reference.",

The script successfully identified Fire Station 301 as located at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in Arlington, VA, with the nearest Metro station being 'Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport' on the Blue and Yellow Lines. For Cleveland Elementary School, the research found it at 1825 8th Street NW, Washington, DC 20001, with the nearest Metro stations being Shaw-Howard University and U Street/Cardozo on the Yellow and Green Lines. The code confirmed both locations can connect to the Silver Line system via downtown DC transfer stations. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - successfully located both facilities and determined their Metro connections to the Silver Line system. The comprehensive research data has been saved to 'fire_station_cleveland_school_research.json' and 'fire_station_cleveland_school_comprehensive_analysis.json' files. The only minor gap is that Cleveland Elementary School's exact Metro connection details could benefit from additional verification, but the core research objectives have been achieved with high confidence.",

    "description": "This implementation conducts comprehensive research to locate Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting at Reagan National Airport) and Cleveland Elementary School in the Washington DC area, then determines their nearest Metro stations and connections to the Silver Line system. The approach uses multiple phases: (1) Targeted Google searches for Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF using specific aviation and airport terminology, (2) Comprehensive searches for Cleveland Elementary School in the Washington DC area, (3) Metro system research focusing on Silver Line connections, and (4) Geographical analysis combining search results with known Metro system layout. The code identifies Fire Station 301 as being located at Reagan National Airport (DCA) in Arlington, Virginia, served by the Blue and Yellow Metro lines at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station. For Cleveland Elementary School, it determines the location is in Washington DC with various Metro access points. Both locations can connect to the Silver Line (which serves Dulles Airport) via downtown DC transfer stations like Metro Center and L'Enfant Plaza. All findings are saved to comprehensive JSON files for detailed analysis and reference.",

The script conducted comprehensive research and definitively identified both locations: (1) Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is located at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (1 Aviation Circle, Arlington, VA 22202) with nearest Metro station being 'Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport' on Blue/Yellow Lines, and (2) Cleveland Elementary School is located at 1825 8th Street NW, Washington, DC 20001 with nearest Metro stations being Shaw-Howard University and U Street/Cardozo on Yellow/Green Lines. The code successfully verified both locations can connect to the Silver Line system via downtown DC transfer stations - Fire Station 301 connects via Rosslyn transfer and Cleveland Elementary via Metro Center transfer. The research collected 48 fire station results, 46 Cleveland school results, and 36 Metro results, providing high-confidence findings. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - both specific locations identified with precise addresses, nearest Metro stations determined, and Silver Line connections confirmed. Comprehensive analysis saved to multiple files including 'fire_station_cleveland_metro_connections_final.json' and 'fire_station_cleveland_research_summary.txt'. No further development is needed as all research objectives have been fully achieved.",
