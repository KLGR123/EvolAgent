This code executes 14 targeted search queries covering both locations, analyzes results for Metro-related keywords, and categorizes findings by relevance. The approach includes: (1) Museum-focused queries targeting the Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles, (2) Fire station queries for DCA ARFF Station 301, (3) General Metro system queries for context, (4) Automated analysis of search results for station names and transportation indicators, (5) Structured data storage in workspace for further analysis. Based on preliminary DC Metro knowledge, this sets up identification of Silver Line access for the museum and Blue/Yellow Line access for the fire station, with downtown transfer connections between the locations.',

The script successfully executed 13 out of 14 search queries, collected 122 results, and identified 71 high-relevance results with detailed analysis. Key findings include: (1) National Air and Space Museum east of Potomac refers to Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA, (2) Closest Metro station is Innovation Center on Silver Line with bus connection, (3) Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF research was included but needs more specific analysis, (4) Reagan National Airport is served by Blue/Yellow Lines. The output contains extensive search data (122 results) and has been properly saved to JSON and text files in workspace. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - successfully identified museum location and Metro access, but needs focused analysis on Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF location and specific station-to-station connections.

This code inspects the JSON structure from Phase 1, analyzes 122 search results for station mentions and Metro line connections, and identifies definitive answers for both locations. The approach includes: (1) Safe JSON file inspection to understand data structure, (2) Systematic extraction of station names and Metro lines from search results, (3) Categorization of results by relevance to museum vs fire station locations, (4) Identification of specific stations: Innovation Center (Silver Line) for Udvar-Hazy Center and Reagan National Airport (Blue/Yellow Lines) for Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF, (5) Route connection analysis showing Silver Line to Blue/Yellow Line transfers via downtown stations, (6) Comprehensive findings compilation with alternative stations and access methods. This completes the PLAN objectives by providing specific Metro stations and connection routes between the National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac River and Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF.',

The analysis successfully processed the search data from Phase 1 and identified specific Metro stations for both locations: (1) National Air and Space Museum east of Potomac River (Udvar-Hazy Center) is served by Innovation Center station on Silver Line with Fairfax Connector Bus 983, (2) Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF is served by Reagan National Airport station on Blue/Yellow Lines, (3) Connection route identified as Silver Line to downtown transfer points (Metro Center, L'Enfant Plaza, Rosslyn) then Blue/Yellow Lines. The code produced comprehensive analysis with 11 station mentions, categorized 53 high-value results, and created detailed findings with transfer points and estimated travel times.
