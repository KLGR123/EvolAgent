    "plan": "Search for Girls Who Code organization's official website, reports, or publications that contain historical data about the percentage of women in computer science. Look for specific statistics showing the decline from 37% to a lower percentage (likely 24% based on the 13% change), and identify the time period over which this change occurred.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate Girls Who Code's specific data about women in computer science percentages and the timeframe for the 13% decline from 37%, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find Girls Who Code's official statistics or reports documenting this historical trend in women's representation in computer science, (4) This directly targets the organization mentioned in the TASK and should provide the specific years needed to calculate the duration of this demographic change",
