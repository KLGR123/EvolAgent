    "description": "This is the initial phase of searching for Girls Who Code's official documentation of the computer science gender statistics decline from 37% to 24%. I'm accessing their main website sections including research, impact, advocacy, and resources pages to find authoritative sources. The code implements a systematic approach by: (1) Accessing multiple Girls Who Code official URLs, (2) Analyzing content for specific percentage indicators (37%, 24%) and relevant terms like 'computer science', 'gender gap', 'decline', (3) Calculating relevance scores based on presence of target statistics, (4) Saving all HTML content for detailed analysis, and (5) Prioritizing sources most likely to contain the target data. This establishes the foundation for finding the specific historical data about women's representation decline in computer science that Girls Who Code has documented in their advocacy work.",

The code appears to be running but either timed out, encountered a network issue, or is still processing. The setup phase worked correctly - workspace directory was created, headers were configured, and the search objective was clearly defined. However, we cannot determine if any Girls Who Code sources were successfully accessed or if the target statistics (37% to 24% decline) were found. **PLAN** alignment: 10% - initialization complete but no actual data retrieval confirmed. Recommended action: Re-run the code with a shorter timeout period or check if there are network connectivity issues preventing access to Girls Who Code website.',

    "description": 'This enhanced search implementation systematically accesses Girls Who Code official sources with improved error handling and timeout management to prevent hanging. The approach includes: (1) Robust error handling with 10-second timeouts to avoid the previous execution cutoff, (2) Systematic analysis of each source for target statistics (37% and 24%), (3) Priority scoring based on presence of both target percentages and relevant content indicators, (4) Detailed pattern matching to find specific mentions of the decline from 37% to 24%, (5) Identification of research links and sections that might contain the target data, (6) Comprehensive results saving for further analysis. This builds on the previous attempt by addressing the timeout issue and providing more targeted analysis of the content for the specific statistics mentioned in the PLAN.',

The search successfully identified girlswhocode.com/about-us as containing both target percentages along with relevant terms. However, execution was interrupted during the 4th URL (impact page) due to an unrelated package installation issue with 'youtubesearchpython'. **PLAN** alignment: 70% - Successfully found the target statistics on official Girls Who Code source, but analysis was incomplete. The comprehensive search results were being saved to 'girls_who_code_comprehensive_search.json' with detailed pattern matching. Recommended action: The code should be modified to remove any unnecessary package dependencies (like youtubesearchpython) and focus on completing the analysis of the high-priority source that already contains both 37% and 24% statistics. The about-us page appears to be exactly what we're looking for.",

The implementation focuses on: (1) Loading the high-priority HTML file that scored 139 points in the previous search, (2) Extracting all mentions of 37% and 24% with surrounding context to understand the decline narrative, (3) Searching for combined patterns that mention both statistics together, (4) Analyzing computer science related sentences containing these percentages, (5) Looking for timeframe information to understand when this decline occurred, (6) Extracting structured content sections that contain the target data, (7) Saving comprehensive analysis results for documentation. This builds directly on the successful previous search that identified the about-us page as the authoritative Girls Who Code source containing the target statistics, now providing detailed extraction and context analysis of the specific 37% to 24% decline data.',

The analysis successfully extracted the key information: 'In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. Today, it's only 24%.' This provides the exact decline from 37% to 24% with the timeframe (1995 to present). The code found 2 mentions of 37%, 2 mentions of 24%, 3 combined patterns showing both statistics together, and identified the timeframe as starting in 1995. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - The objective has been fully achieved. The code located the authoritative Girls Who Code source documenting the historical decline in women's representation in computer science from 37% to 24%, with clear timeframe information (1995 to present). The detailed analysis has been saved to 'girls_who_code_statistics_analysis.json' for future reference.

    "description": "This final analysis extracts and presents the complete findings from the successful Girls Who Code search. The PLAN has been fully achieved - we found the authoritative Girls Who Code source documenting the exact decline from 37% to 24% women in computer science, with the specific timeframe (1995 to present). The key finding is the official Girls Who Code statement: 'In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. Today, it's only 24%.' This provides all required elements: (1) Official Girls Who Code source from their about-us page, (2) Historical data showing 37% representation in 1995, (3) Current data showing 24% representation today, (4) Clear documentation of the 13 percentage point decline, (5) Timeframe spanning approximately 29 years. The analysis also captures additional context about the worsening gender gap and Girls Who Code's mission to address it. All documentation has been saved to workspace files for future reference. The PLAN objective is 100% complete with authoritative source material.",
