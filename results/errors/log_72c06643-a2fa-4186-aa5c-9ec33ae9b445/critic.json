  "reason": "Task analysis: Calculate the volume of 0.312 kg Freon-12 refrigerant at the bottom of Marianas Trench under peak temperature conditions, requiring thermodynamic modeling under extreme pressure. Individual evaluation: Member 1 used comprehensive research methodology, obtaining Freon-12 critical properties (Tc=384.95K, Pc=4.136 MPa) and Marianas conditions (1,086 atm, 4°C peak temperature), applying Peng-Robinson equation of state to yield 179 mL - demonstrated excellent systematic approach with proper phase identification and validation. Member 2 conducted thorough research but incorrectly identified peak temperature as 400°C from hydrothermal vents rather than ambient deep-sea temperature, leading to supercritical conditions analysis yielding 252 mL - showed strong methodology but critical temperature parameter error. Member 3 performed rigorous analysis with similar Freon-12 properties, using 2°C temperature and 1,110 bar pressure, applying Peng-Robinson equation to achieve 179 mL - demonstrated solid thermodynamic modeling with appropriate supercritical fluid treatment. Convergence analysis: Members 1 and 3 reached identical 179 mL result using similar ambient temperature conditions (4°C vs 2°C) and consistent pressure values (~1,100 bar range). Divergence resolution: Member 2's 400°C represents localized hydrothermal vent temperature, not the stabilization temperature for a Freon-12 system at trench bottom, which would equilibrate to ambient deep-sea temperature. Integration assessment: Members 1 and 3 correctly identified that 'peak temperature' refers to maximum ambient temperature (1-4°C range) rather than hydrothermal anomalies. Final validation: 179 mL represents highly compressed liquid Freon-12 under extreme pressure with proper ambient temperature consideration.",
