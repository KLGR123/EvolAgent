# Developer Plan #3 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_54  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 3  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-12 01:28:18

## Plan Content
```
Research the Platte River region and its characteristics to better understand which collegiate summer baseball leagues might operate in areas where this river with braided channels serves sandhill cranes. Then search more broadly for any collegiate summer baseball leagues that have both US and Canada coverage AND operate in regions that include both Montana and Platte River areas (Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming). Focus on identifying leagues that might have had teams in smaller Montana cities like Anaconda, even if not currently active, and extract information about when such teams began play.
```

## Plan Description
```
This approach is necessary because: (1) Previous research found no current team in Anaconda meeting all criteria, but we may need to look at historical teams or broader league structures, (2) The developer identified that no single league meets all three geographic criteria simultaneously, suggesting we need to reconsider our search strategy, (3) Expected outcome is to find leagues that historically operated across these regions or identify if there were teams that began play in earlier years, (4) This may reveal when a team that met these criteria actually began play, even if they're no longer active

### Development Step 24: Cities of Westernmost and Easternmost Universities: Santa Clara University, UMass Boston

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

**Use Cases**:
- University admissions geospatial outreach optimization by automatically identifying the westernmost and easternmost campuses (Santa Clara, Boston) for region-specific marketing materials
- Logistics planning for shipping orientation kits to farthest-west and farthest-east university locations, ensuring efficient routing and cost estimates
- Campus tour mobile app backend setup that uses the two boundary cities to generate full cross-country campus visit itineraries
- Academic research on longitudinal diversity trends using the script to pinpoint geographic extremes among participating universities
- Marketing team regional ad spend allocation by targeting student populations at the westernmost and easternmost campuses
- Data science course demonstration of real-world CSV parsing and coordinate-based sorting, using university longitude data as the example
- State education department reporting tool to visualize the geographic spread of public universities, highlighting Santa Clara and Boston as boundary cases

### Development Step 27: List Cities of Westernmost Santa Clara University and Easternmost UMass Boston

**Description**: Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.

- GIS-driven infrastructure planning in a nationwide educational consortium, programmatically locating the westernmost and easternmost member institutions for network optimization.
- Logistics route optimization for academic book distributors, determining the extreme pickup (Santa Clara) and delivery (Boston) university cities to streamline shipping schedules.
- Higher education research on regional funding disparities, automatically extracting extreme campus locations to define study boundaries between Santa Clara and Boston.
- Student housing investment analysis, marking coast-to-coast extremes in university markets (Santa Clara and Boston) to guide real estate development decisions.
- IT capacity planning for a cloud provider, identifying the geographic spread of university data centers (from Santa Clara to Boston) to optimize server deployment.
- Sustainability assessment in campus operations, pinpointing the farthest western and eastern universities (Santa Clara and Boston) to model carbon footprint scenarios.
- Virtual campus tour series design, creating a guided itinerary from the westernmost university (Santa Clara) to the easternmost (Boston) for prospective students.

The HISTORY shows that several JSON files were created with research data, but the quality was limited due to search library issues. I'm examining the structure and content of key files like research_summary.json, platte_river_research.json, montana_baseball_leagues.json, us_canada_baseball_leagues.json, regional_baseball_leagues.json, and montana_baseball_history.json. This inspection will help me understand what information we already have and what gaps need to be filled with more targeted searches. By understanding the existing data structure first, I can then build upon it more effectively to identify specific collegiate summer baseball leagues that operate in both US/Canada with coverage of Montana and Platte River regions, particularly focusing on historical information about teams in smaller Montana cities like Anaconda.",

The code has a persistent variable scoping error where the loop variable 'filename' on line 16 doesn't match the variable name used in the generator expression. Looking at the code, line 17 uses 'keyword in filename.lower()' but there's a mismatch in the list comprehension scope. This is the same error that has occurred repeatedly in **HISTORY**. The error prevents identification of research-related files and stops all inspection activities. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no analysis of existing research data was completed. However, the code successfully listed all 18 files in workspace, revealing extensive existing research including 'anaconda_baseball_comprehensive_research.json', 'final_answer_anaconda_montana.json', 'platte_river_research.json', and multiple verification files that likely contain the needed information. Recommended fix: The issue is in the list comprehension scope - ensure the variable name used in the generator expression matches the loop variable. Given the substantial existing research files visible, this inspection approach is correct for analyzing what data we already have before proceeding with additional searches.",

It presents the key findings: (1) Platte River region characteristics including its braided channels serving sandhill cranes across Nebraska/Colorado/Wyoming, (2) Analysis showing no single league operates in all required regions, (3) Historical Anaconda teams (Copperheads, Miners, Smelters) existed but current collegiate summer team status is unconfirmed, (4) Closest matches are Expedition League (Montana + US/Canada) and Rocky Mountain League (Montana + Platte River), each missing one criterion. The synthesis confirms that while historical teams existed in smaller Montana cities like Anaconda, the specialized geographic requirements make it unlikely that such a comprehensive league exists.
