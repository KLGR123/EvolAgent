                <strong>True Answer:</strong><br>
                Wahab M. Akbar<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task decomposition: Identify the chief executive elected in 1998 who served until 2007 in an area established by Elpidio Quirino's law with June 16, 1948 effective date through territorial segregation from Zamboanga City. Individual solution evaluation: Member 1 identified Zamboanga del Sur Province as the area created by Republic Act No. 711, concluding Antonio Cerilles was the governor (1998-2007). However, their research shows inconsistencies - they mention both June 16, 1948 and June 17, 1952 as establishment dates, indicating uncertainty. Member 2 also identified Zamboanga del Sur but concluded Aurora Cerilles was the governor, showing internal contradiction with Member 1 despite analyzing the same province. Their research demonstrates similar date inconsistencies and less systematic verification. Member 3 identified Basilan Province as created by Republic Act No. 288, with Wahab Akbar as governor (1998-2007). Their research shows consistent methodology, clear verification of the June 16, 1948 effective date, and systematic confirmation of territorial segregation from Zamboanga City. Cross-analysis reveals fundamental disagreement on the province identity (Zamboanga del Sur vs. Basilan) and governor names. Convergence exists only on the 1998-2007 timeframe and Quirino's 1948 law. Divergence resolution: Member 3's identification of Basilan Province aligns precisely with the task requirements - Republic Act No. 288 has verifiable June 16, 1948 effective date and clear territorial segregation from Zamboanga City. Members 1 and 2 show date inconsistencies that undermine their provincial identification. Synthesis evaluation: Member 3 demonstrates superior methodological rigor with consistent historical verification, precise date matching, and systematic confirmation of all task elements. Their research shows no internal contradictions and provides complete documentation of Wahab Akbar's three consecutive gubernatorial terms (1998-2007). Final validation confirms Basilan Province as the correct area established by Quirino's June 16, 1948 law, with Wahab Akbar as the definitively identified chief executive.
