                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                Film producer<br><br>
                <strong>True Answer:</strong><br>
                American film actor and singer<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task analysis: Identify the profession of the person who secured 1955 film rights for an Ian Fleming James Bond work featuring a character inspired by William S. Tanner, but later relinquished rights due to inability to acquire the entire series. All three members conducted comprehensive research and reached identical conclusions through independent methodologies. Member 1 used systematic historical research focusing on early Bond film rights, identifying Gregory Ratoff as the rights holder who acquired Casino Royale rights in March 1955 for $6,000. Member 2 employed character-focused investigation, tracing the William S. Tanner connection to Felix Leiter in Casino Royale, confirming Ratoff's acquisition and subsequent rights relinquishment after his 1960 death. Member 3 utilized chronological analysis of pre-EON Productions Bond rights deals, verifying the same Ratoff-Casino Royale connection with detailed transaction evidence. Convergence analysis: Perfect agreement across all members on key facts - Gregory Ratoff (Russian-born American), Casino Royale (1955 rights acquisition), $6,000 purchase price, and rights relinquishment due to death/series acquisition failure. All members identified Ratoff's multi-faceted career as actor, director, and producer, with his specific role in the 1955 Casino Royale acquisition being that of film producer. Cross-validation through multiple authoritative sources (Wikipedia, James Bond Wiki, film databases) confirms accuracy. Integration assessment: No contradictions found; all approaches complement each other with consistent factual findings. Final answer 'Film producer' represents Ratoff's specific professional capacity in the 1955 rights acquisition, supported by unanimous member consensus and extensive documentary evidence.
