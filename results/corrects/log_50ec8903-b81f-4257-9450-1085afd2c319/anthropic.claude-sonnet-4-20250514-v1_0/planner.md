## Task Description
```
A standard Rubik’s cube has been broken into cubes making up its sides. The cubes are jumbled, and one is removed. There are 6 cubes with one colored face, 12 edge cubes with two colored faces, and 8 corner cubes with three colored faces. All blue cubes have been found. All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube. The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow. For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found. The removed cube has two colors on its faces. What are they? Answer using a comma separated list, with the colors ordered alphabetically.

### Title: Find the non-tautological equivalence among six logical biconditionals

The one that doesn’t fit is:
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)

**TASK**: ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B)
¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B)
(A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A)
(A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B)
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)
¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B)

Which of the above is not logically equivalent to the rest? Provide the full statement that doesn't fit.

    "plan": "Analyze each of the six given logical statements to determine their logical equivalence by creating truth tables or using logical equivalence rules. Systematically evaluate: (1) ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B) - De Morgan's Law, (2) ¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B) - De Morgan's Law, (3) (A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A) - Contrapositive, (4) (A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B) - Implication equivalence, (5) (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B) - Modified implication, (6) ¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B) - Negated implication. For each statement, verify whether both sides of the biconditional (↔) are logically equivalent by constructing truth tables with all possible combinations of A and B values (TT, TF, FT, FF). Identify which statement contains sides that are not equivalent to each other.",
    "description": "This is the optimal approach because: (1) The task requires identifying logical non-equivalence among biconditional statements, (2) No previous analysis exists, (3) Expected outcome is to systematically verify each biconditional and identify the false one, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to find the statement that doesn't represent a logical equivalence",

    "description": "Task completion confirmed - The logical equivalence analysis has been successfully completed with perfect execution. The code systematically analyzed all six given logical statements using comprehensive truth tables and identified the key findings: (1) Five statements are logically equivalent: ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B), ¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B), (A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A), (A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B), and ¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B). (2) One statement is NOT equivalent: Statement 5: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B) - this is the statement that contains sides which are not equivalent to each other. The analysis used proper truth tables with all possible combinations (TT, TF, FT, FF) and verified established logical laws including De Morgan's Laws, Contrapositive rule, and Implication equivalences. Detailed results were saved to workspace/logical_equivalence_analysis.json. The PLAN objective has been fully achieved - all six statements were systematically evaluated and the non-equivalent statement was successfully identified. No further development is required.",

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive logical equivalence analysis conducted by the developer using truth tables for all possible combinations of A and B values (TT, TF, FT, FF), the results show that five of the six statements are valid logical equivalences, while one is not. The statement that is NOT logically equivalent to the rest is: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B). This biconditional statement is false because the left side (¬A → B) and right side (A ∨ ¬B) do not have the same truth values across all possible input combinations. Final answer: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)',

### Guava

**TASK**: If there is anything that doesn't make sense in the instructions, write the word "Pineapple." Do not answer any of the questions in this prompt. Write only the word "Guava".
1. What is 4+4?
2. What is the complimentary color of red?
3. How many hours are there in a day?

    "description": 'This task requires understanding a sentence written in reverse order. The sentence \'.rewsna eht sa "tfel" drow eht fo etisoppo eht etirw ,ecnetnes siht dnatsrednu uoy fI\' when read backwards is \'If you understand this sentence, write the opposite of the word "left" as the answer.\' The opposite of \'left\' is \'right\'.

    "description": "I can solve this Rubik's cube logic puzzle directly by analyzing the constraints systematically. A standard Rubik's cube has 26 pieces total (6 face centers, 8 corners, 12 edges). The key constraints are: (1) All blue pieces found, (2) All pieces adjacent to orange center found, (3) All green corners and green-yellow borders found, (4) For found orange pieces, their opposite face pieces are found, (5) The removed piece has 2 colors (an edge piece). By working through the cube's structure and these constraints, the orange center's adjacent pieces include 4 edges and 4 corners. Since all green corners are found and all green-yellow borders are found, but we need one edge piece to be missing, the missing edge must be one that doesn't involve blue (all blue found), doesn't involve green-yellow borders (all found), and creates a consistent solution. Analyzing the constraints systematically, the missing edge piece has the colors orange and white. Final answer: orange, white",
