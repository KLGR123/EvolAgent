  "final_answer": "10",
  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine the exact number of intermediate stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens on MBTA's Franklin-Foxboro line as of May 2023, excluding both endpoints from the count. All three members conducted comprehensive research using official MBTA sources and reached consistent methodologies, though with different final answers. Member 1 evaluation: Used systematic approach with MBTA API data, identified 17 total stops on Franklin line, calculated 9 intermediate stops using positions 16 (South Station) and 6 (Windsor Gardens), resulting in 11 total stops minus 2 endpoints. Demonstrated strong technical rigor but potential sequencing error. Member 2 evaluation: Accessed official MBTA website with embedded JSON data, identified Foxboro branch sequence of 12 stations from South Station to Windsor Gardens, calculated 10 intermediate stops (12 total minus 2 endpoints). Showed excellent source verification and clear station sequence documentation. Member 3 evaluation: Combined MBTA website and API sources, identified 17 total Franklin line stops, used geographic coordinate sorting for route approximation, calculated 10 intermediate stops between positions 17 (South Station) and 6 (Windsor Gardens). Applied innovative geographic methodology but with less certainty about exact route sequence. Convergence analysis: Members 2 and 3 both reached 10 intermediate stops through different but valid approaches. Member 1's result of 9 stops appears to stem from potential station sequence interpretation differences. Divergence resolution: The key difference lies in whether Hyde Park station is included in the count. Members 2 and 3 both explicitly include Hyde Park in their intermediate station lists, while Member 1's analysis may have excluded it. Cross-referencing official MBTA Foxboro branch documentation confirms the standard route includes Hyde Park between Forest Hills and Readville. Integration assessment: Member 2's approach provides the most reliable foundation with clear Foxboro branch sequence documentation, supported by Member 3's independent verification reaching the same count. Final validation: The 10 intermediate stops (Back Bay, Ruggles, Forest Hills, Hyde Park, Readville, Endicott, Dedham Corporate Center, Islington, Norwood Depot, Norwood Central) represent the definitive answer based on official MBTA route documentation.",
