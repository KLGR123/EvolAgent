## Task Description
```
¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B)
¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B)
(A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A)
(A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B)
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)

Which of the above is not logically equivalent to the rest? Provide the full statement that doesn't fit.

Use these search approaches: (1) Search for the paper title 'Attention is All You Need' on Google Scholar or arXiv, (2) Look for the official paper PDF which should be available on arXiv, (3) Extract the architecture details specifically focusing on the encoder structure and number of layers/blocks mentioned in the model description.",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. The comprehensive logical equivalence verification has been executed and the PLAN objective has been fully achieved. The analysis systematically tested all 6 logical equivalences using truth tables for all possible combinations of A and B values (TT, TF, FT, FF). The results clearly identified that Statement 5: '(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)' is NOT logically equivalent to the others, as it produces different truth values on both sides of the biconditional for two specific combinations: when A=False and B=True, and when A=False and B=False. All other equivalences (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) were verified as valid logical equivalences. The detailed truth table output and analysis have been saved to 'workspace/logical_equivalence_analysis.json'. The tester confirmed successful execution with no errors and validated that the PLAN requirements were met perfectly. No further development is needed.",
