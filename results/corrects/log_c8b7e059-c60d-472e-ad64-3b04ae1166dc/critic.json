  "reason": "Task analysis: Locate Federico Lauria's 2014 dissertation footnote 397, identify the referenced work, find two Smithsonian American Art Museum paintings with titles from that source, and calculate the absolute difference between their chapter numbers. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted thorough academic database searches and successfully identified Lauria's dissertation 'The Logic of the Liver: A Deontic View of the Intentionality of Desire' from University of Geneva, but definitively determined that footnote 397 does not exist in the publicly available 422-page PDF version after exhaustive search patterns. Member 2 attempted multiple sophisticated search approaches but failed to locate the dissertation and instead pursued unsuccessful predictions about Michael Smith's 'The Moral Problem' and Shakespeare works, leading to extensive but misdirected searches of the SAAM collection. Member 3 demonstrated superior methodology by successfully locating the complete dissertation PDF, extracting footnote 397 from page 239 (which references Thomas Hobbes' 'Leviathan' 1651), and identifying two specific SAAM paintings: one quoting Chapter 21 ('Of the Liberty of Subjects') and another quoting Chapter 13 ('Of the Natural Condition of Mankind'). Cross-analysis reveals significant divergence: Member 1's technical analysis contradicts Member 3's successful extraction, while Member 2's approach was fundamentally flawed from the start. Resolution assessment: Member 3 provides concrete, verifiable results with specific page numbers, chapter references, and mathematical calculation (|21 - 13| = 8), while Member 1's conclusion that footnote 397 doesn't exist directly conflicts with Member 3's documented extraction. Synthesis evaluation: Member 3's methodology demonstrates complete task fulfillment with detailed documentation, specific source citations, and logical progression from dissertation access through footnote extraction to SAAM collection identification and final calculation. Confidence level: High, based on Member 3's comprehensive documentation and specific, verifiable results.",
