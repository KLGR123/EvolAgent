  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify when construction was completed for a building with blue-tiled minaret that required eight years for decorative embellishment, located in an Azerbaijan area with 19th-century bathhouse, traditional houses, and adjacent to a building with 5,000+ piece Shebeke windows. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted systematic research identifying Sheki Historic Centre and Khan's Palace, providing clear evidence that the Palace of Shaki Khans required eight years for decorative embellishment (1789-1797) with multiple authoritative sources confirming 1797 completion date. Member 2 followed similar methodology, also identifying Sheki Khan's Palace with identical timeline findings - construction completed in 1797 after eight years of decorative work, supported by four independent sources including Wikipedia and UNESCO references. Member 3 initially identified Baku's Old City but later focused on Palace of Shirvanshahs, concluding 1442 completion date based on 15th-century construction timeline analysis. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on Sheki Khan's Palace with 1797 completion, while Member 3 diverged to different location and historical period. Convergence assessment: Members 1 and 2 independently reached identical conclusions through different but complementary research approaches, both confirming Sheki location, Khan's Palace identification, eight-year decorative timeline, and 1797 completion. Divergence resolution: Member 3's Palace of Shirvanshahs (1442) represents different building and historical period - 15th century vs 18th century construction. Evidence evaluation strongly favors Sheki Khan's Palace based on: (1) Multiple sources confirming eight-year decorative embellishment period, (2) Architectural features match perfectly (Shebeke windows with 5,000+ pieces confirmed), (3) Timeline consistency across independent research, (4) Higher source reliability and cross-validation. Final validation confirms 1797 as construction completion date for Sheki Khan's Palace after eight-year decorative embellishment period.",
