**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-12 04:06:51

## Plan Content
```
Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the historic area in Azerbaijan that contains a 19th-century bathhouse still in use, traditional Azerbaijani houses with verandas and stained-glass windows, and specifically locate the building with a blue-tiled minaret that is adjacent to another building featuring Shebeke windows with over 5,000 handcrafted wood and glass pieces, mirrored balconies, and intricate historical wall paintings. Focus search terms on 'Azerbaijan historic area 19th century bathhouse traditional houses', 'Azerbaijan blue-tiled minaret Shebeke windows 5000 pieces', 'Azerbaijan historic buildings mirrored balconies wall paintings', and 'Azerbaijan traditional architecture verandas stained glass windows'.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific historic area in Azerbaijan and the buildings described with very distinctive architectural features, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate this unique combination of historic bathhouse, traditional houses, blue-tiled minaret, and elaborate Shebeke windows that will help identify the specific buildings and construction timeline, (4) This directly targets the core TASK of finding when construction was completed for the building that took eight years for decorative embellishment

### Development Step 8: Surrey Lodge South London: Victorian origins, temperance hall, 1935 rotating stage, WWII damage, Burnley move

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify Surrey Lodge in South London and trace its historical development during the Victorian era. Focus on finding information about: (1) the original organization that developed Surrey Lodge, (2) its transformation into a temperance hall, (3) the installation of the UK's first rotating stage in 1935, (4) World War II bomb damage, and (5) the company's relocation to Burnley. Use search terms like 'Surrey Lodge South London Victorian era temperance hall', 'first rotating stage UK 1935 temperance hall', 'Surrey Lodge bomb damage World War II Burnley', and 'Victorian temperance organization Surrey Lodge founder'.

**Use Cases**:
- Heritage conservation consultants mapping architectural evolutions of Victorian-era lodges for restoration planning
- Academic historians compiling primary source timelines of temperance movements in London’s 19th-century social reform venues
- Cultural tourism agencies creating enriched interactive guides highlighting milestones like the UK’s first rotating stage in historical halls
- Local council archives automating WWII damage assessments of municipal buildings for grant applications and rebuilding strategies
- Corporate heritage departments tracing the lineage and relocations of legacy companies for anniversary publications and branding campaigns
- Nonprofit social historians analyzing temperance hall transformations to underpin public lectures and educational program development
- Legal due diligence teams researching property provenance and historical modifications for redevelopment and planning permissions
- Documentary producers sourcing detailed period facts and evidence for accurate media portrayals of South London’s entertainment venues

### Development Step 2: Surrey Lodge History: Victorian Beginnings, Temperance Hall, 1935 Rotating Stage, WWII Bombing, Burnley Relocation

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify Surrey Lodge in South London and trace its historical development during the Victorian era. Focus on finding information about: (1) the original organization that developed Surrey Lodge, (2) its transformation into a temperance hall, (3) the installation of the UK's first rotating stage in 1935, (4) World War II bomb damage, and (5) the company's relocation to Burnley. Use search terms like 'Surrey Lodge South London Victorian era temperance hall', 'first rotating stage UK 1935 temperance hall', 'Surrey Lodge bomb damage World War II Burnley', and 'Victorian temperance organization Surrey Lodge founder'.

**Use Cases**:
- Municipal heritage teams automating extraction of Victorian-era building histories from archived city council websites for preservation grant applications
- Academic history researchers compiling precise timelines of 19th-century social movement venues by analyzing saved HTML search results from digital archives
- Theatre technology historians identifying early rotating stage installations by scanning periodicals and hall websites for 1930s date references
- Insurance risk assessors evaluating wartime bomb damage liabilities by mining online council bomb-damage records and compiled archive pages
- Corporate due diligence analysts tracking legacy company relocations by parsing historical press releases and relocation notices from archived web pages
- Digital librarians structuring metadata on temperance movement meeting halls by extracting organizational founding details from library web archives
- Real estate developers reviewing heritage constraints by retrieving structural transformation records and wartime impact data from municipal HTML archives
- Cultural tourism planners building interactive timelines of historical London landmarks by consolidating extracted event dates and site transformations from saved HTML

### Development Step 6: Surrey Lodge South London: Victorian Origins, Temperance Hall, 1935 Rotating Stage, WWII Damage, Burnley Move

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify Surrey Lodge in South London and trace its historical development during the Victorian era. Focus on finding information about: (1) the original organization that developed Surrey Lodge, (2) its transformation into a temperance hall, (3) the installation of the UK's first rotating stage in 1935, (4) World War II bomb damage, and (5) the company's relocation to Burnley. Use search terms like 'Surrey Lodge South London Victorian era temperance hall', 'first rotating stage UK 1935 temperance hall', 'Surrey Lodge bomb damage World War II Burnley', and 'Victorian temperance organization Surrey Lodge founder'.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum exhibition curation: Conduct automated web searches and timeline analysis to verify Surrey Lodge’s architectural changes, temperance hall conversion, and WWII damage for accurate exhibit signage and narrative content.
- Heritage consultancy for planning permissions: Compile historical evidence of Victorian-era developments, rotating stage installations, and bomb damage to support restoration and planning applications for listed building consent.
- Academic publication on the Victorian temperance movement: Systematically extract founding organization details, key dates, and transformation events at Surrey Lodge for inclusion in a peer-reviewed history journal article.
- Cultural preservation grant writing: Assemble a detailed chronology of Surrey Lodge’s conversion into a temperance hall, first rotating stage installation, and wartime repairs to strengthen grant proposals for heritage conservation funding.
- Legal property due diligence: Trace documented structural modifications, WWII bomb damage references, and subsequent company relocation records to resolve title disputes and inform conveyancing reports.
- Urban historical mapping project: Automate targeted searches and relevance scoring to integrate Surrey Lodge’s development timeline and relocation data into a digital heritage GIS for local authority archives.
- Industrial heritage documentary production: Gather precise dates and primary‐source snippets about the UK’s first rotating stage in 1935 and Surrey Lodge’s wartime story to script an educational documentary segment.
- Genealogical estate research: Use comprehensive search queries and timeline extraction to uncover ancestral connections to Surrey Lodge, detailing original ownership, temperance hall use, and post-Blitz relocation for family history publications.

### Development Step 3: Surrey Lodge: Origins, Victorian Temperance Hall, 1935 Rotating Stage, WWII Damage, Burnley Relocation

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify Surrey Lodge in South London and trace its historical development during the Victorian era. Focus on finding information about: (1) the original organization that developed Surrey Lodge, (2) its transformation into a temperance hall, (3) the installation of the UK's first rotating stage in 1935, (4) World War II bomb damage, and (5) the company's relocation to Burnley. Use search terms like 'Surrey Lodge South London Victorian era temperance hall', 'first rotating stage UK 1935 temperance hall', 'Surrey Lodge bomb damage World War II Burnley', and 'Victorian temperance organization Surrey Lodge founder'.

**Use Cases**:
- Heritage architecture research for conservation specialists analyzing Surrey Lodge’s Victorian origins, temperance hall transformation, and WWII damage to inform restoration projects
- Digital archiving for local history museums automating extraction of founding organization details, rotating stage installation in 1935, and relocation events to create enriched exhibit metadata
- Curriculum development for history educators generating interactive timelines and textual snippers about Surrey Lodge’s evolution for classroom modules on South London heritage
- Urban planning risk assessment for property developers evaluating past bomb damage, historical uses, and relocation patterns of sites like Surrey Lodge to guide redevelopment proposals
- Genealogy support tools for family historians mining HTML archives for references to temperance organizations and community halls where ancestors may have participated
- Cultural tourism itinerary building for guide operators compiling thematic tours that highlight Surrey Lodge’s first rotating stage and other unique historical milestones
- Academic digital humanities research on tracing organizational transformations and societal impact by scraping web records for evidence of Victorian temperance movements and subsequent relocations
- Heritage insurance underwriting systems assessing structural history, wartime damages, and refurbishment records of listed buildings such as Surrey Lodge to calculate coverage and premiums

This code executes 10 targeted searches focusing on specific architectural features: 19th-century bathhouse, traditional Azerbaijani houses with verandas and stained glass, blue-tiled minaret, and Shebeke windows with 5000+ handcrafted pieces. The approach uses relevance scoring based on key architectural terms, systematic evidence collection for each target feature, and location candidate identification. Results are analyzed for architectural evidence frequency, success rate calculation, and top findings ranking. All search results and analysis data are saved to workspace/azerbaijan_historic_area_research.json for further processing and reference.',

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed comprehensive web searches as specified in the **PLAN**. The script executed all 10 targeted search queries and successfully identified key architectural features in Azerbaijan. Research achieved 62.5% success rate (5/8 features confirmed) and identified two primary location candidates: Baku (13 mentions) and Sheki (7 mentions). The search found evidence of Shebeke windows, blue minarets, stained glass, verandas, and wall paintings. Particularly significant finding: Result #3 specifically mentions 'over 5000 pieces of coloured glass' in Sheki's Khan's Palace, directly matching the **PLAN** requirement for 'Shebeke windows with over 5,000 handcrafted wood and glass pieces.' The comprehensive research data has been properly saved to 'workspace/azerbaijan_historic_area_research.json' for future reference. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all required search terms were executed and architectural evidence was systematically collected and analyzed. The research successfully narrowed down the historic area to likely be in Sheki, Azerbaijan, based on the concentrated mentions of specific architectural features including the 5000+ piece Shebeke windows requirement.",
