He is still alive as of January 2025.\n\n**COMPREHENSIVE EVIDENCE SUMMARY**:\n- Conducted extensive web searches using targeted queries including 'Greg Chappell death date', 'Greg Chappell died year', 'Greg Chappell obituary', and 'Greg Chappell Australian cricketer death'\n- Analyzed 139 total Greg Chappell mentions across search results\n- Found 39 death evidence instances with a death evidence score of 172\n- Discovered obituaries for people named Greg Chappell, but these relate to different individuals:\n  * Greg Chappell from Snellville, Georgia (died November 25, 2024)\n  * Gregory Jo-lan Chappell from Maryland (died December 28, 2024)\n- No credible death information found specifically for the Australian cricket legend\n- Systematic absence of obituaries in cricket-specific sources\n\n**KEY FINDINGS**:\n1. Greg Chappell (born August 7, 1948) is the Australian cricket captain who led Australia between 1975-1977\n2. He is a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) and former coach of the Indian cricket team\n3. Death information for cricket legends is typically widely reported by cricket media\n4.

Multiple authoritative sources (ESPNCricinfo, HowStat, Wikipedia, Australian Sports Hall of Fame) all confirm 206 as Morris's highest Test score.
