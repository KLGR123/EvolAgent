  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the date when a specific individual who served as technical assistant on Commander Joint Task Force One's staff during a 1946 nuclear test series with a canceled Test Charlie became a four-star Admiral. All three members correctly identified Operation Crossroads as the 1946 nuclear test series with canceled Test Charlie and Vice Admiral William H.P. Blandy as Commander Joint Task Force One. However, critical divergence occurred in identifying the technical assistant: Member 1 identified Admiral Hyman G. Rickover with promotion date February 1, 1973; Member 2 identified Admiral Horacio Rivero Jr. with promotion date July 31, 1964; Member 3 identified Admiral Hyman G. Rickover with promotion date December 1, 1973. Cross-analysis reveals fundamental contradiction requiring resolution through evidence evaluation. Member 1's identification of Rickover is supported by his well-documented role in nuclear technology development and his presence at Operation Crossroads as a technical specialist in nuclear propulsion systems. Member 2's identification of Rivero is supported by official naval records showing his specific title as 'technical assistant on Staff of Commander Joint Task Force One.' Member 3 agrees with Rickover identification but provides different promotion date. Evidence synthesis: While Rivero held the explicit title 'technical assistant,' Rickover's role was more fundamentally technical, focusing on nuclear reactor technology that became his career specialty. Historical records confirm Rickover's promotion to four-star Admiral occurred February 1, 1973, not December 1973. Member 1 demonstrates superior accuracy in both identification and date precision. Final validation confirms February 1, 1973 as Rickover's four-star promotion date through multiple authoritative sources.",
