# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Solve the anagram by rearranging the letters in 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten' to find the original Shakespeare line that the professor is asking for. Use systematic anagram-solving techniques to identify the famous Shakespeare quote that can be formed from these exact letters.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully extracted the professor's anagram challenge from the audio file, (2) The specific text to rearrange has been identified: 'in one of The Bard's best thought of tragedies are insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten', (3) Expected outcome is to find the original Shakespeare line that uses these exact letters, (4) This directly solves the assignment by providing the anagram text that fulfills the professor's request for the famous Shakespeare quote.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Extract Hidden Sentence from a 5×7 Letter Grid by Reading Rows Left-to-Right

**Description**: Analyze the 5x7 block of text by reading all letters from left to right, row by row, to extract a meaningful sentence. Start with the first row 'THESE', then continue with 'AGULL', 'GLIDE', 'DPEAC', 'EFULL', 'YTOMY', and 'CHAIR'. Concatenate all letters in order and identify word boundaries to form a coherent sentence from the resulting letter sequence.

**Use Cases**:
- Escape room designers validating and debugging a 5×7 letter‐block puzzle that reveals a clue sentence when read row by row
- Museum exhibit developers building an interactive station to decipher hidden messages in historical letter grids for visitor engagement
- Intelligence analysts automating the extraction of covert instructions from intercepted fixed-size text matrices in secure communications
- Educational software engineers creating language-learning modules where students parse letter blocks to form meaningful sentences
- Digital archivists reconstructing fragmented medieval manuscripts by concatenating surviving grid lines and inferring word boundaries
- Marketing teams embedding secret promotional taglines in product packaging letter arrays, then verifying correct message retrieval
- Cryptography instructors demonstrating steganographic techniques by having students systematically analyze and extract sentences from text blocks

### Development Step 1: Extracting a Hidden Sentence from a 5×7 Letter Grid

**Description**: Analyze the 5x7 block of text by reading all letters from left to right, row by row, to extract a meaningful sentence. Start with the first row 'THESE', then continue with 'AGULL', 'GLIDE', 'DPEAC', 'EFULL', 'YTOMY', and 'CHAIR'. Concatenate all letters in order and identify word boundaries to form a coherent sentence from the resulting letter sequence.

**Use Cases**:
- Archaeological inscription grid decoding for reconstructing fragmented ancient texts in museum research
- Digital forensics transposition cipher analysis for law enforcement investigators extracting hidden messages from intercepted communications
- Marketing promotion puzzle automation for generating and verifying hidden message word grids in brand engagement campaigns
- Word-search puzzle solver integration for mobile gaming apps to automatically identify user answers in custom letter grids
- Educational language-learning tool for teachers to create grid-based sentence puzzles that reinforce vocabulary and grammar
- Assistive technology for visually impaired users converting scanned letter grids from textbooks into coherent sentences via OCR and boundary detection
- Quality control in PCB manufacturing, decoding alphanumeric grid labels printed on circuit boards to verify part placement
- Academic computational linguistics research for analyzing and reconstructing text sequences from grid-based cipher schemes

### Development Step 1: 4x4 Boggle Solver with words_alpha Dictionary to Find Longest Valid Word

**Description**: Download the words_alpha dictionary from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words to workspace/words_alpha.txt and then implement a Boggle solver to find all valid words that can be formed from the given 4x4 board (ABRL/EITE/IONS/FPEI) using the downloaded dictionary. The solver should check all possible paths on the board where adjacent cells (including diagonally adjacent) can be visited exactly once per word, then identify the longest valid English word(s) and return the alphabetically first one if there are ties.

**Use Cases**:
- ESL vocabulary assessment tool for educators: generate custom 4×4 boards aligned to lesson vocab lists, automatically solve them to create answer keys and track student progress
- Word-game app development and difficulty calibration: integrate the solver to validate player inputs in real time, ensure boards yield a target number of valid words, and dynamically adjust board complexity
- Linguistic pattern research and statistical analysis: analyze thousands of random Boggle boards to study word-length distribution, letter adjacency effects, and frequency of rare words in large English corpora
- Puzzle quality assurance in game design: automatically test proposed board layouts to verify minimum and maximum possible word lengths, ensuring puzzles are solvable and meet design criteria
- Competitive Boggle training and performance analytics: enable tournament players to upload board snapshots, receive full solution lists with scoring insights, and identify high-value word paths to refine strategy
- Assistive technology for visually impaired gamers: integrate the solver with voice-based interfaces to read out possible word paths and word lists, making Boggle accessible via screen readers
- Marketing and branding brainstorming: agencies input sets of campaign-specific letters to discover valid, memorable words and acronyms for product naming and slogan generation
- AI algorithm benchmarking and complexity testing: use Boggle solving as a standardized search and language-comprehension challenge to compare path-finding optimizations and dictionary lookup strategies

### Development Step 3: Download words_alpha and Implement Boggle Solver for 4×4 Board, Return Longest Word

**Description**: Download the words_alpha dictionary from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words to workspace/words_alpha.txt and then implement a Boggle solver to find all valid words that can be formed from the given 4x4 board (ABRL/EITE/IONS/FPEI) using the downloaded dictionary. The solver should check all possible paths on the board where adjacent cells (including diagonally adjacent) can be visited exactly once per word, then identify the longest valid English word(s) and return the alphabetically first one if there are ties.

**Use Cases**:
- Real-time Boggle tournament assistant integrated into digital board game platforms to suggest optimal word paths and improve player strategies
- Automated quality assurance for mobile word games, verifying that each 4×4 puzzle grid has a valid solution and meets predefined difficulty criteria
- Educational spelling tool for elementary classrooms, generating customized letter boards and word lists to reinforce vocabulary and phonics lessons
- Puzzle difficulty calibration for tabletop game designers, analyzing letter distributions and longest word possibilities to balance game challenges before publication
- Cognitive training app for seniors, creating daily timed word-finding exercises with varying board configurations to maintain and assess mental agility
- Linguistic research on letter adjacency and lexical networks, applying the solver to large corpora of letter matrices extracted from historical manuscripts
- Marketing campaign ideation platform that transforms brand names into thematic Boggle boards and derives creative taglines or product descriptors
- Accessibility feature for visually impaired gamers, combining screen readers with the solver to vocalize found words and guide users through optimal letter paths
