# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Analyze the attached audio file data/gaia/2023/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3 to extract the professor's anagram question. Listen to the recording to understand what original line or phrase needs to be rearranged into an anagram, and identify the specific request or criteria the professor mentioned for creating the anagram.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the professor's exact question and requirements from the audio recording, (2) No previous analysis of the audio file has been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to transcribe and comprehend the anagram assignment details, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK by extracting the necessary information to solve the anagram problem

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Extract Professor Willowbrook’s Recommended Calculus Midterm Reading Pages from Audio File

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached audio file data/gaia/2023/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3 to extract Professor Willowbrook's spoken instructions about recommended reading page numbers for the Calculus mid-term exam. Convert the audio to text using speech recognition, identify all mentioned page numbers or page ranges, and compile them into a complete list for study preparation.

**Use Cases**:
- University professors automating the extraction of recommended textbook page numbers from lecture recordings to generate student study guides
- Corporate training managers parsing internal webinar audio to list referenced slides and page ranges for post-session follow-up materials
- Legal teams transcribing deposition audio to index specific document page references and exhibit numbers for case preparation
- Medical educators converting conference call recordings into text to extract cited journal article pages for continuing education credits
- Textbook publishers processing author interview audio to compile page and chapter references for supplementary study guides
- E-learning platform engineers integrating audio-to-text parsing to auto-populate course modules with spoken page and section numbers
- Academic conference organizers analyzing keynote speech recordings to identify and distribute cited paper page ranges to attendees
- Religious organizations transcribing sermon audio to extract scripture passage and page references for congregational reading assignments

### Development Step 1: Extract Calculus Midterm Reading Page Numbers from Professor Willowbrook’s Audio Instructions

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached audio file data/gaia/2023/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3 to extract Professor Willowbrook's spoken instructions about recommended reading page numbers for the Calculus mid-term exam. Convert the audio to text using speech recognition, identify all mentioned page numbers or page ranges, and compile them into a complete list for study preparation.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal case preparation: transcribe attorney dictation to extract referenced case reporter page numbers and statute sections for streamlined brief drafting
- Medical board exam study guide creation: convert recorded clinical professor lectures into text and compile recommended textbook page ranges for board review
- Corporate compliance training automation: process compliance officer’s audio sessions to identify and list relevant handbook pages for mandatory employee training materials
- Academic research literature mapping: transcribe expert interviews and automatically extract cited journal article page ranges to build a structured reading list for a systematic review
- Technical documentation maintenance: analyze developer meeting recordings to find API manual page references, ensuring accurate and up-to-date code documentation updates
- Publishing workflow optimization: convert editor’s voice notes to text and compile page numbers in the manuscript that require revisions or fact-checking
- Historical archive indexing: transcribe oral history interviews to extract archival box and page numbers mentioned, facilitating precise digital cataloguing of records
- Financial audit preparation: process auditor walkthrough audio to identify specific pages in financial reports and schedules needed for CFO compliance reviews

### Development Step 1: Extracting a Hidden Sentence from a 5×7 Letter Grid

**Description**: Analyze the 5x7 block of text by reading all letters from left to right, row by row, to extract a meaningful sentence. Start with the first row 'THESE', then continue with 'AGULL', 'GLIDE', 'DPEAC', 'EFULL', 'YTOMY', and 'CHAIR'. Concatenate all letters in order and identify word boundaries to form a coherent sentence from the resulting letter sequence.

**Use Cases**:
- Archaeological inscription grid decoding for reconstructing fragmented ancient texts in museum research
- Digital forensics transposition cipher analysis for law enforcement investigators extracting hidden messages from intercepted communications
- Marketing promotion puzzle automation for generating and verifying hidden message word grids in brand engagement campaigns
- Word-search puzzle solver integration for mobile gaming apps to automatically identify user answers in custom letter grids
- Educational language-learning tool for teachers to create grid-based sentence puzzles that reinforce vocabulary and grammar
- Assistive technology for visually impaired users converting scanned letter grids from textbooks into coherent sentences via OCR and boundary detection
- Quality control in PCB manufacturing, decoding alphanumeric grid labels printed on circuit boards to verify part placement
- Academic computational linguistics research for analyzing and reconstructing text sequences from grid-based cipher schemes

### Development Step 2: Extract Hidden Sentence from a 5×7 Letter Grid by Reading Rows Left-to-Right

**Description**: Analyze the 5x7 block of text by reading all letters from left to right, row by row, to extract a meaningful sentence. Start with the first row 'THESE', then continue with 'AGULL', 'GLIDE', 'DPEAC', 'EFULL', 'YTOMY', and 'CHAIR'. Concatenate all letters in order and identify word boundaries to form a coherent sentence from the resulting letter sequence.

**Use Cases**:
- Escape room designers validating and debugging a 5×7 letter‐block puzzle that reveals a clue sentence when read row by row
- Museum exhibit developers building an interactive station to decipher hidden messages in historical letter grids for visitor engagement
- Intelligence analysts automating the extraction of covert instructions from intercepted fixed-size text matrices in secure communications
- Educational software engineers creating language-learning modules where students parse letter blocks to form meaningful sentences
- Digital archivists reconstructing fragmented medieval manuscripts by concatenating surviving grid lines and inferring word boundaries
- Marketing teams embedding secret promotional taglines in product packaging letter arrays, then verifying correct message retrieval
- Cryptography instructors demonstrating steganographic techniques by having students systematically analyze and extract sentences from text blocks

### Development Step 2: Find Picnic Location by Decrypting Caesar Cipher “Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.”

**Description**: Decrypt the Caesar cipher message 'Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.' by testing different shift values to find the correct decryption that reveals a readable English location for the picnic meeting place.

**Use Cases**:
- Decrypting encoded treasure hunt clues in a museum’s mobile app, where visitors solve Caesar-ciphered messages to unlock exhibit content
- Automated analysis of intercepted low-level communications by a small investigative team, quickly filtering out gibberish and highlighting readable location hints
- Educational coding platform feature that demonstrates classical ciphers, auto-brute-forces student-submitted strings, and identifies likely English outputs
- Escape-room game backend tool to validate and test multiple shift variations of puzzle messages, ensuring only one shift yields a coherent meeting spot clue
- Forensic analyst routine for scanning suspects’ digital notes, running Caesar shifts to detect concealed meeting addresses or drop-zone instructions
- Historical archive research assistant to batch-decrypt letters with unknown shifts, flagging those containing readable greetings or place names for further study
- ARG (Alternate Reality Game) content pipeline that auto-validates community-submitted encrypted hints, scoring each shift for common words and proper nouns
- Automated quality check in a spy-novel writing software that ensures any in-story Caesar-ciphered passages resolve to plausible English location descriptions
