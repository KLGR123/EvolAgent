# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 65638e28-7f37-4fa7-b7b9-8c19bb609879  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-30 04:36:12

## Plan Content
```
Search for the book with DOI 10.1353/book.24372 to identify the title, author, and subject neurologist. Use web search with queries like 'DOI 10.1353/book.24372', 'site:muse.jhu.edu 10.1353/book.24372', and 'Project MUSE book 24372' to locate the official book page. Extract complete bibliographic information including title, author, publication details, and any available abstract or description that identifies which neurologist the book concerns.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific book and its subject neurologist using the provided DOI, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to find the official book page with complete metadata and subject information, (4) This establishes the foundation for subsequently locating chapter 2 and the author who influenced the neurologist's belief in 'endopsychic myths'

This approach targets multiple search strategies: (1) Direct DOI search, (2) Site-specific Project MUSE searches, (3) Combined DOI and neurologist keyword searches. The code executes 7 different search queries to maximize chances of finding the book page, then analyzes results to prioritize Project MUSE links and DOI-related content. It attempts to access the most promising result and performs initial content analysis to identify bibliographic information and neurologist references. All search results and downloaded page content are saved to workspace/ files for detailed parsing in subsequent iterations. This establishes the foundation for extracting the book's title, author, and identifying which neurologist is the subject of the work.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully identified the book with DOI 10.1353/book.24372. The search results clearly show: **Title**: 'A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt', **Publisher**: Leuven University Press, **Publication Year**: 2013/2021, **Pages**: 320, **Language**: English, **Open Access**: Yes. The code successfully accessed the Project MUSE page and saved the HTML content to workspace for further analysis. However, the **PLAN** objective to identify the 'subject neurologist' appears to have a misconception - this book is ABOUT Sigmund Freud (who was a neurologist) and his theories on guilt, not about a different neurologist as a subject. The quick content analysis shows the book doesn't contain neurologist/neurology/brain terms prominently, suggesting it focuses on Freud's psychological theories rather than his neurological work. **PLAN** alignment: 90% complete - all bibliographic information found, but the 'subject neurologist' is Freud himself. Recommendation: Parse the saved HTML file (workspace/book_doi_10_1353_book_24372.html) to extract the author name and confirm Freud is the neurologist being studied in this psychological analysis.",

    "description": "Second iteration implementation to parse the downloaded Project MUSE HTML content and extract complete bibliographic information for the book with DOI 10.1353/book.24372. This code systematically extracts: (1) Book title using multiple methods (page title, H1 tags, meta tags, regex patterns), (2) Author information from citation metadata and text patterns, (3) Publisher, publication year, pages, language, and open access status, (4) Neurologist identification through content analysis. The implementation addresses the tester's feedback that Sigmund Freud IS the 'subject neurologist' - the book analyzes Freud's psychological theories on guilt, with Freud being the neurologist who developed psychoanalysis. The code provides comprehensive bibliographic extraction, confirms Freud as both the book's subject and the neurologist in question, and saves all analysis results to workspace/book_complete_analysis.json for reference. This completes the PLAN objective by identifying the title ('A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt'), extracting author information, and confirming Sigmund Freud as the neurologist subject of this psychological analysis.",
