                        Task Description:<br>In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. <br><br>The word that indicates oneself is &quot;Pa&quot; is the nominative form, &quot;Mato&quot; is the accusative form, and &quot;Sing&quot; is the genitive form. <br><br>The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is &quot;Maktay&quot;. When it is used in the present, it is used in it&#x27;s root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is &quot;Tay&quot;, and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is &quot;Aktay&quot;. It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as &quot;is pleasing to&quot;, meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.<br><br>The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is &quot;Apple&quot; is the nominative form, &quot;Zapple&quot; is the accusative form, and &quot;Izapple&quot; is the genitive form. <br><br>Please translate &quot;I like apples&quot; to Tizin.<br><br>Retrieved Episodic Memory Examples:<br>### Unlambda code: which character to add to output “For penguins”?<br><br>**TASK**: In Unlambda, what exact charcter or text needs to be added to correct the following code to output &quot;For penguins&quot;? If what is needed is a character, answer with the name of the character. If there are different names for the character, use the shortest. The text location is not needed. Code:<br><br>`r<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;Research and analyze the Unlambda programming language to understand its syntax, specifically focusing on code structure that would output text strings like &quot;For penguins&quot;.&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand Unlambda&#x27;s syntax to identify what&#x27;s missing in the given code, (2) No prior research has been done on this language yet, (3) Expected outcome is to gain sufficient knowledge about Unlambda to analyze the provided code snippet, (4) Understanding the language fundamentals is critical before we can determine what character needs to be added to fix the code.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;The task has been successfully completed. I\&#x27;ve provided a comprehensive implementation that researches and analyzes the Unlambda programming language, with specific focus on understanding syntax for outputting text strings like &quot;For penguins&quot;.\n\nThe code successfully created:\n1. A syntax reference document explaining Unlambda\&#x27;s core operators and principles\n2. A &quot;Hello, World!&quot; example with detailed explanation\n3. Two different implementations for outputting &quot;For penguins&quot; in Unlambda\n4. Additional examples showing different output patterns\n5. A comprehensive summary of findings\n\nThe key finding is that in Unlambda, to output a text string like &quot;For penguins&quot;, we use the `.c` operator to print each character and chain these operations using the backtick (`) application operator. The complete solution is:\n``.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i\n\nAs confirmed by the tester\&#x27;s feedback, the code executed successfully and fully met the requirements specified in the PLAN. All necessary files were generated in the workspace directory, and the implementation thoroughly demonstrates how to create Unlambda code that outputs the desired text string.&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. After analyzing the Unlambda code, I&#x27;ve identified that the exact character needed to fix the code is the backtick (`). The given code lacks backticks between the dot operators. In Unlambda, `.c` prints character c, but these operations need to be connected with backticks (`) as application operators. The correct format should be: `.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i. Final answer: backtick&quot;,<br>}<br>```<br><br>```<br><br><br>``.F.o.r. .p.e.n.g.u.i.n.si<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>```<br><br>### Decrypt Caesar Cipher to Reveal Picnic Meeting Location<br><br>**TASK**: This is a secret message my friend gave me. It says where we should meet for our picnic on Friday. The only problem is, it’s encrypted in the Caesar cipher, so I can’t read it. Can you tell me what it says? This is the message:<br><br>Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.<br><br>```<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &quot;Decrypt the Caesar cipher message &#x27;Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.&#x27; by testing different shift values to find the correct decryption that reveals a readable English location for the picnic meeting place.&quot;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &#x27;This is the optimal approach because: (1) We have a Caesar cipher encrypted message that needs decryption to reveal the picnic location, (2) No previous decryption attempts have been made, (3) Expected outcome is to find the correct shift value and decode the message into readable English text, (4) This directly solves the TASK by revealing where the friends should meet for their Friday picnic&#x27;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The Caesar cipher decryption task has been completed successfully! The code systematically tested all 25 possible shift values and identified the correct decryption with shift value 10. The encrypted message &#x27;Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.&#x27; decrypts to &#x27;Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.&#x27; - a clear, readable English sentence that reveals the picnic meeting location. The analysis correctly identified this as the most likely candidate with a readability score of 12, containing recognizable English words &#x27;picnic&#x27;, &#x27;is&#x27;, &#x27;in&#x27;, and &#x27;plaza&#x27;. The results have been saved to workspace files (picnic_location.txt and all_caesar_results.txt) for reference. The PLAN objective has been 100% achieved - the Caesar cipher has been successfully decrypted and the readable English location &#x27;Polybius Plaza&#x27; has been definitively identified as the picnic meeting place.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. The developer has already decrypted the Caesar cipher message &#x27;Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.&#x27; by systematically testing all possible shift values and found that with a shift of 10, the message decodes to &#x27;Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.&#x27; This clearly reveals the meeting location for the Friday picnic. Final answer: Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.&quot;,<br>}<br>```<br><br>### Find First Name of Character in Magda M.

I successfully identified and extracted the complete name of the actor who played Ray in the Polish-language version of &#x27;Everybody Loves Raymond&#x27;:\n\n**ANSWER: Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski**\n\nKey findings:\n- Polish adaptation title: &#x27;Wszyscy kochają Romana&#x27; (Everybody Loves Roman)\n- Actor: Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski plays the titular character Roman (equivalent to Ray)\n- Source: Wikipedia page for the Polish adaptation\n- Additional confirmation from Sony Pictures press release about Polish version\n\nThe research was conducted using 4 comprehensive search approaches as specified in the PLAN:\n1. Direct Polish cast search\n2. Polish dubbing information search  \n3. Wikipedia and entertainment database search\n4. Polish remake/adaptation search\n\nFiles created in workspace:\n- raymond_polish_actor_summary.json (detailed findings)\n- raymond_polish_actor_summary.txt (human-readable summary)\n- 4 search result JSON files with complete research data\n\nThe tester confirmed that the search results successfully identified Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski from the Wikipedia page about &#x27;Wszyscy kochają Romana&#x27;, and all required information has been extracted and verified. The complete actor name has been definitively determined through authoritative sources, fulfilling all PLAN requirements.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &quot;Search for information about the actor Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski&#x27;s role in the production &#x27;Magda M.&#x27; to identify which character he played. Focus on finding cast information, filmography details, or production records through multiple search approaches: (1) Search for &#x27;Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski Magda M. cast character role&#x27;, (2) Look for Polish film/TV databases or IMDb entries for &#x27;Magda M.&#x27; production, (3) Search for Kasprzykowski&#x27;s complete filmography to identify his role in &#x27;Magda M.&#x27;, (4) Check Polish entertainment sources or production company information about &#x27;Magda M.&#x27; casting. Extract the character name he portrayed in this production to complete the task.&quot;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This is the optimal next step because: (1) We have successfully identified Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski as the actor who played Ray in the Polish version of Everybody Loves Raymond, (2) The task now requires finding his character name in &#x27;Magda M.&#x27; to extract the first name, (3) Expected outcome is to find casting information for &#x27;Magda M.&#x27; and identify Kasprzykowski&#x27;s character, (4) This directly completes the second part of the task requirement to determine his role in &#x27;Magda M.&#x27;&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;developer&#x27;,<br>    &quot;code&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully! Based on the search results from the previous iteration, I have definitively identified that Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski played the character **Wojciech Płaska** in the TV series &#x27;Magda M.&#x27; (2005-2007). This finding is confirmed by multiple reliable sources: (1) IMDb cast listing shows &#x27;Bartek Kasprzykowski · Wojciech Plaska&#x27;, (2) Wikipedia cast section lists &#x27;Bartek Kasprzykowski · Wojciech Płaska, 2005–2007&#x27;, (3) IMDb episode page explicitly states &#x27;Bartek Kasprzykowski as Wojciech Plaska&#x27;, (4) FamousFix confirms &#x27;Role: Wojciech Plaska&#x27;, and (5) Polish entertainment source mentions &#x27;W latach 2005–2007 grał Wojciecha w serialu TVN Magda M.&#x27; The character name has been successfully extracted and verified across multiple independent sources. The search results have been properly documented in workspace/kasprzykowski_magda_m_search_results.json for reference. No further development is required as the PLAN objective has been fully achieved - the character identification is complete and confirmed.&quot;,<br>}<br>{<br>    &quot;role&quot;: &#x27;planner&#x27;,<br>    &quot;plan&quot;: &#x27;&lt;END&gt;&#x27;,<br>    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted by the developer, we have established that: (1) Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski played Ray (Roman) in the Polish version of &#x27;Everybody Loves Raymond&#x27; called &#x27;Wszyscy kochają Romana&#x27;, (2) The same actor played the character Wojciech Płaska in the TV series &#x27;Magda M.&#x27; (2005-2007), confirmed by multiple reliable sources including IMDb and Wikipedia. The first name of the character he played in &#x27;Magda M.&#x27; is Wojciech. Final answer: Wojciech&quot;,<br>}<br>```
