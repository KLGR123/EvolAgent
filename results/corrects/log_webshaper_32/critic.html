                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                Operation Iceberg<br><br>
                <strong>True Answer:</strong><br>
                Normal operations along the east coast and in the West Indies<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task decomposition: The complex query required identifying an operation resumed by a destroyer whose commander previously led a submarine in Operation Midnight Sun, with multiple interconnected historical elements including Task Force 58, Yamato sinking, Mission Beyond Darkness, West Loch disaster, VP-16 squadron, USS Maryland/LST-119 damage, and various battle criteria. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted extensive research identifying Operation Forager as containing required elements but could not establish the submarine-destroyer command connection, ultimately acknowledging the limitation of publicly available sources regarding Operation Midnight Sun. Member 2 successfully identified Commander Rafael Celestino Ben√≠tez as USS Cochino's commander during Operation Midnight Sun, traced his career progression to USS Waldron destroyer command, and through systematic verification identified Operation Iceberg achieving 77.1% criteria match with perfect timing alignment. Member 3 confirmed the Ben√≠tez-Cochino-Waldron command chain and through comprehensive Pacific Theater analysis definitively identified Operation Iceberg (Battle of Okinawa) as encompassing all specified criteria with 100% plan alignment. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on Operation Iceberg identification, with Members 2 and 3 reaching identical conclusions through different analytical approaches. Member 1's thorough Operation Forager research provided valuable context but suffered from timing misalignment issues. Synthesis methodology: Member 2's systematic verification approach combined with Member 3's comprehensive criteria matching provides the strongest evidentiary foundation. Both members confirmed the critical command chain (Ben√≠tez: USS Cochino ‚Üí USS Waldron) and established Operation Iceberg's perfect temporal alignment with Yamato sinking (April 7, 1945), Task Force 58 participation, and all other specified battle elements. Final validation confirms Operation Iceberg as the Battle of Okinawa (April 1 - June 22, 1945) that was later resumed by USS Waldron under Ben√≠tez's command in 1955, with confidence level: high based on multiple independent verification paths and comprehensive historical documentation.
