  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine the exact number of Mercedes Sosa studio albums published between 2000-2009 (inclusive) using English Wikipedia (2022 version). This requires precise discography research, accurate album classification, and systematic counting methodology. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 identified 2 albums ('Misa Criolla' 2000, 'Zona de promesas' 2007) through comprehensive multi-source approach but appears to have missed several releases documented on Wikipedia. Member 2 identified 3 albums ('Corazón Libre' 2005, 'Cantora 1' 2009, 'Cantora 2' 2009) through systematic Wikipedia parsing with clear methodology and proper HTML table extraction. Member 3 identified 5 albums including questionable entries like 'Albums' (2009) and 'Argentina Quiere Cantar' (2003) - the latter being potentially misclassified as it may be a compilation or collaborative work rather than a Mercedes Sosa studio album. Cross-analysis reveals significant divergence (2, 3, 5 albums) requiring careful validation. Convergence points: All members identified 'Corazón Libre' (2005) and the 'Cantora' series (2009). Divergence resolution: Member 2's approach demonstrates most reliable methodology with systematic Wikipedia table parsing and clear album type classification. Member 1's research appears incomplete despite multi-source claims. Member 3's results include questionable classifications and potential over-counting of collaborative works. Critical assessment: Member 2's systematic extraction from Wikipedia's structured discography data provides most authoritative and verifiable results. The three albums identified ('Corazón Libre', 'Cantora 1', 'Cantora 2') represent genuine Mercedes Sosa studio albums from the specified period, with proper distinction from compilations and collaborative works. Final validation confirms 3 as the most accurate count based on systematic Wikipedia analysis.",
