# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 8  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-30 19:27:52

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about a developer who received planning permission in October 2019 to convert a homeless shelter into flats in a city with Bournemouth Seafront features. Focus the search on these key elements: (1) 'October 2019 planning permission homeless shelter flats conversion', (2) 'Bournemouth Seafront Russell-Cotes Art Gallery Museum', (3) 'East Cliff Lift historic villas 19th century', (4) 'conservation area 1987 Bournemouth'. Cross-reference news articles, planning applications, local government records, and property development announcements from October 2019 to identify the specific city and developer involved.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific city through the unique combination of location features and the October 2019 planning permission event, (2) No previous search has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find news articles or official records linking these specific details to a city name, (4) This directly addresses the core TASK of identifying the city where this development occurred
