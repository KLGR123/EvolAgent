# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 5  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-30 19:12:06

## Plan Content
```
Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang and their criminal activities. Focus on finding information about: (1) The gang's first major bank heist in Indiana in 1924, (2) Their 1934 bank robbery that was John Dillinger's last robbery involving a black Hudson getaway car, (3) The city police department that acquired a custom Studebaker car in response, (4) The 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and disputed escape plan found on Dillinger, (5) The death of a sheriff during this jailbreak, (6) Harry Pierpont's conviction related to these events. Extract names of gang members, locations, dates, and any mentions of witnesses or informants who provided testimony leading to convictions.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) The task involves complex historical criminal events requiring detailed research, (2) No previous execution results exist, (3) Expected outcome is to establish the basic facts about the gang, their crimes, and key figures involved, (4) This foundational research will help identify the specific person who provided testimony that led to convictions of the two gang leaders mentioned in the task.

    "description": "Starting fresh with a clean execution environment to conduct the comprehensive gang research as outlined in the PLAN. I'm addressing the previous execution issues by ensuring proper variable initialization and using quoted search terms for more precise results. This code performs three targeted searches: (1) General information about the gang members Harry Pierpont, Everett Bridgewater, and Earl Northern, (2) The 1924 Indiana bank heist that was their first major crime, and (3) The 1934 bank robbery involving the black Hudson getaway car that was Dillinger's last robbery. All results are being saved to a single consolidated file (workspace/gang_search_results.txt) for better organization. The searches use specific quoted terms to improve accuracy and avoid the confusion that occurred in previous attempts. After these initial searches, I'll continue with additional searches for the police department's Studebaker response, the 1933 jailbreak incident, sheriff's death, and witness testimony information.",

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed without errors and successfully performed the first search for gang members, returning valuable results about Harry Pierpont, Everett Bridgewater, and Earl Northern. The output confirms these were real gang members during the Prohibition era and provides good foundational information. However, the execution was incomplete - it shows the code was cut off during the third search (1934 black Hudson) and appears to have been interrupted. The first two searches completed successfully and found relevant Wikipedia entries and historical sources. **PLAN** alignment: ~30% complete - good progress on identifying gang members and some activities, but missing the specific details about the 1924 Indiana heist, complete 1934 black Hudson robbery information, police Studebaker response, 1933 jailbreak details, sheriff's death, and witness testimony. The comprehensive results file 'workspace/gang_search_results.txt' contains valuable data that should be preserved. Next step: Complete the remaining searches for police department Studebaker response, 1933 jailbreak incident, sheriff's death, Harry Pierpont's conviction, and witness/informant testimony to fulfill the **PLAN** requirements.",

These searches target the specific remaining elements from the PLAN that haven't been fully addressed yet. All results are being appended to the existing workspace/gang_search_results.txt file to maintain a comprehensive database of information. After these searches complete, I'll have gathered data on all six major aspects mentioned in the PLAN: gang members, 1924 Indiana heist, 1934 black Hudson robbery, police Studebaker response, 1933 jailbreak incident, and conviction/testimony details. The next step will be to analyze and summarize all the collected information to provide a complete picture of the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang's criminal activities.",

Search 4 found excellent results about the police department Studebaker response, specifically identifying the South Bend police department as the one that acquired the custom 1934 Studebaker President in response to Dillinger's activities. Search 5 gathered valuable information about the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and escape plans, with multiple sources confirming the incident. However, Search 6 (Harry Pierpont conviction and witness testimony) appears to have been cut off mid-execution, showing only workspace switching messages without displaying the actual results. **PLAN** alignment: ~70% complete - significant progress made with key findings including South Bend police Studebaker response and 1933 jailbreak details, but missing the complete witness testimony information and final analysis.
