What is the name of the person who provided testimony that helped convict two gang leaders—the leader of the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang, which committed bank robberies including their first major heist in Indiana in 1924 and a 1934 bank robbery (the last robbery participated in by John Dillinger) involving a black Hudson getaway car and prompting the city's police department to acquire a custom Studebaker car; and another leader who committed a crime during the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger, resulting in the death of a sheriff and leading to the conviction of Harry Pierpont?

    "plan": "Search for specific information about the witness or informant who provided testimony that led to the convictions of both Harry Pierpont and the leader of the gang's 1934 robbery (Dillinger's last). Focus on finding: (1) Court records and trial testimonies from Harry Pierpont's murder conviction for Sheriff Jess Sarber's death, (2) Witness accounts from the 1934 South Bend bank robbery case, (3) Names of individuals who testified against gang members in federal or state trials, (4) Police informants or accomplices who turned state's evidence, (5) Any person whose testimony was instrumental in convicting leaders of both the 1933 jailbreak murder and the 1934 bank robbery.

    "description": "INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION REACHED\n\nAfter conducting a comprehensive investigation and critical verification analysis, I can provide the definitive answer to the PLAN's core question:\n\n**FINAL CONCLUSION: No definitive cross-case witness found in available sources**\n\nKEY FINDINGS:\n\n1. **Ed Shouse's Confirmed Role:**\n   - Ed Shouse was a former Dillinger gang member who turned informant\n   - He definitively testified against Harry Pierpont in the Sheriff Sarber murder trial (March 1934)\n   - His testimony was instrumental in convicting Pierpont, Makley, and Clark for the Lima jail break and Sarber's murder\n   - This is well-documented across multiple historical sources\n\n2. **South Bend Robbery Case Analysis:**\n   - Conducted extensive searches for Ed Shouse's testimony in the 1934 South Bend bank robbery case\n   - Found 6 results mentioning Ed Shouse in connection with South Bend\n   - Critical verification revealed that 5 out of 6 results showed NO CLEAR TESTIMONY EVIDENCE\n   - These were general mentions of Ed Shouse as a former gang member, not evidence of witness testimony\n   - Only 1 result showed potential testimony evidence but was inconclusive\n\n3. **Critical Distinction Identified:**\n   - Being mentioned as a gang member ≠ testifying as a witness\n   - Being associated with South Bend ≠ testifying in the South Bend robbery case\n   - The PLAN requires evidence of actual TESTIMONY leading to convictions, not just gang membership\n\n4. **Search Methodology:**\n   - Conducted 8 comprehensive search phases with 50+ targeted queries\n   - Searched court records, trial testimonies, newspaper archives, and historical crime databases\n   - Used multiple search strategies including exact name searches, cross-case connections, and federal trial records\n   - Saved all results to workspace files: witness_search_results.json, ed_shouse_focused_analysis.json, final_ed_shouse_analysis.json, final_cross_case_investigation.json\n\n**ANSWER TO PLAN OBJECTIVES:**\n\nThe investigation successfully identified witness testimony in the Harry Pierpont case (Ed Shouse) but could not definitively establish the same witness testifying in Dillinger's 1934 South Bend bank robbery case. While Ed Shouse is confirmed as the key witness whose testimony led to Harry Pierpont's conviction for Sheriff Sarber's murder, available sources do not provide clear evidence that he also testified in the South Bend robbery case that led to convictions related to Dillinger's last robbery.\n\nThe search suggests that finding the specific cross-case witness may require access to actual court transcripts, trial records, or federal prosecution files that are not readily available in online sources. The investigation has been thorough and comprehensive within the constraints of available public information.\n\n**FILES CREATED:**\n- workspace/witness_search_results.json - Initial comprehensive search results\n- workspace/ed_shouse_focused_analysis.json - Detailed Ed Shouse investigation\n- workspace/final_ed_shouse_analysis.json - Final Ed Shouse analysis\n- workspace/final_cross_case_investigation.json - Complete cross-case investigation results\n- workspace/witness_analysis.json - Additional witness analysis data\n\nThe investigation has been completed to the fullest extent possible with available sources.",
