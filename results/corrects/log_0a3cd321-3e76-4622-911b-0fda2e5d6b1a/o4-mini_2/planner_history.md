    "plan": 'Fetch the World Bank API indicator data for all countries for series NY.GDS.TOTL.ZS (Gross domestic savings % of GDP) for years 2001 through 2010 inclusive, parse the JSON response, filter for countries whose annual savings values exceed 35.0 in every year of that period, and produce the final comma-separated list of country names sorted alphabetically.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal next step because: (1) The core TASK requires identifying which countries maintained gross savings above 35% of GDP for each year from 2001–2010, (2) No data has yet been retrieved or processed, (3) Fetching and filtering the World Bank indicator data directly yields the required authoritative information, and (4) The outcome of this step is the exact list of qualifying countries needed to answer the TASK.',
