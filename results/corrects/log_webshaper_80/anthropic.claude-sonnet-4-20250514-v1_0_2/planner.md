### Where was the author of "Francia’s Reign of Terror" and an 1839 rural novel born?

**TASK**: According to the text, in which place was the author born who wrote both the collection of letters titled "Francia's Reign of Terror"—the third volume that documents a four-year stay under Dictator Francia's rule, criticizes local laziness and government policies, and was written while relying on local hospitality—and a novel published by Saunders and Otley in 1839? This novel, set in rural Scotland and Wales, features a young orphan clerk residing in Glasgow and was illustrated by an artist known for illustrating Charles Dickens' works, who also created an illustration titled "The Great 100 Rat Match" circa 1858.

### French department where composer of Technicolor’s Becky Sharp and 1976 Montreal Olympics theme was born

**TASK**: What is the name of the department in France where the composer, who worked for the company that produced "Becky Sharp," the first full-length color film using three-strip Technicolor, was born, and who composed the theme music for the 1976 Summer Olympics held in Montreal, a piece first used in an international event before 1984?

Focus on finding bibliographic records, historical documents, or military archives that reference Abel Hugo's cartographic or written works about the Napoleonic campaigns in Spain. Also search for details about the Hospital de Saint Louis in Madrid being converted to a military hospital in 1809 and any documented presence of the Hugo brothers there.",
    "description": "This follow-up search is necessary because: (1) Previous research successfully identified Abel Hugo's military service during Napoleon's reign (1808-1814) and Joseph Bonaparte's rule in Spain, but noted that two specific aspects require specialized archives, (2) We need to find concrete evidence of Abel Hugo's authored work with Napoleon's camp maps and the Hospital de Saint Louis connection to provide a complete answer, (3) Expected outcome is to locate bibliographic or historical records that document these specific details mentioned in the TASK, (4) This will allow us to definitively confirm the ruler's identity with full supporting evidence for all aspects of the question",
