                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                1989<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task decomposition: This complex research question requires identifying three interconnected criteria: (1) birthplace in the origin of China's national intangible cultural heritage stone carving techniques, (2) authorship of critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and (3) role as chief interpreter of Mao Zedong's thought. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted systematic research identifying multiple stone carving heritage regions (Chongqing, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian) and definitively identified Chen Boda as meeting all criteria - born in Hui'an County, Fujian Province (Shoushan stone carving heritage region), extensive anti-Chiang writings as Mao's ghostwriter, and 30+ years as Mao's chief interpreter. Death year confirmed as 1989 with high confidence (90/100) and specific date September 22, 1989. Member 2 followed similar methodology, identifying Fujian, Zhejiang, and Beijing as key heritage locations, also concluding Chen Boda (1904-1989) with 93.3% confidence, confirming his role as primary systematizer of Maoist ideology and anti-KMT critic. Member 3 initially focused on Qingtian stone carving but found no matches, then expanded to alternative traditions, ultimately identifying Lin Biao as candidate with death year 1971, though acknowledging weaker stone carving heritage connection. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on Chen Boda identification, methodology, and 1989 death year, while Member 3 diverged toward Lin Biao. Evidence evaluation strongly favors Chen Boda: (1) Strongest birthplace connection - Hui'an County is definitively recognized for Shoushan stone carving heritage, (2) Most comprehensive anti-Chiang writings as Mao's personal secretary and propagandist, (3) Universally recognized as primary interpreter and systematizer of Mao Zedong Thought. Final synthesis: Chen Boda represents the optimal solution with dual independent confirmation, superior evidence quality, and precise death year documentation.
