  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the 1977 New York Yankees player with the most walks and determine their at-bats for that season. This requires comprehensive statistical analysis of individual player performance data from official sources. Member 0 evaluation: Used systematic multi-source approach targeting Baseball-Reference.com, successfully extracted complete batting statistics for all Yankees players, identified Roy White as walk leader with 75 walks and 519 at-bats. Demonstrated methodological rigor with verification steps and comprehensive data validation. Member 1 evaluation: Employed similar Baseball-Reference approach, successfully downloaded and parsed batting statistics into CSV format, correctly identified Roy White with 75 walks and 519 at-bats through systematic data analysis. Showed strong technical execution and data processing methodology. Member 2 evaluation: Also accessed Baseball-Reference but produced fundamentally incorrect results, identifying Reggie Jackson with only 5 walks and 36 at-bats as the leader. This represents a significant data extraction or filtering error, as these numbers are implausibly low for a season leader. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 0 and 1, both independently arriving at Roy White with 75 walks and 519 at-bats using different but valid methodologies. Member 2's result contradicts this consensus and shows internal inconsistency (5 walks would not lead a major league team). Historical context validation: Roy White was indeed a patient hitter known for drawing walks, making 75 walks realistic for a team leader in 1977. Integration assessment: The Roy White/519 at-bats answer is supported by two independent, methodologically sound analyses with detailed verification steps. Final validation confidence: high, based on methodology convergence and historical plausibility.",
