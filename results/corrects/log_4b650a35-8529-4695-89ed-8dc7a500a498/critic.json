  "final_answer": "Guava",
  "reason": "Task analysis: The instructions contain a clear directive with two main components: (1) If anything doesn't make sense, write 'Pineapple', and (2) Do not answer any questions and write only 'Guava'. All three team members demonstrated perfect comprehension of the task requirements. Member 1 provided systematic analysis recognizing the explicit instruction to ignore the mathematical and general knowledge questions, concluding with 'Guava'. Member 2 showed concise understanding of the core directive, correctly identifying that only 'Guava' should be written without answering additional questions. Member 3 demonstrated clear task comprehension, noting the straightforward nature of the directive and correctly avoiding the provided questions. Cross-analysis reveals complete convergence: all members understood that despite the presence of questions (4+4, complementary color of red, hours in a day), the overriding instruction was to write only 'Guava'. No contradictions exist between member approaches - all three correctly identified the meta-instruction that supersedes the apparent questions. The instructions are internally consistent and make logical sense, so the 'Pineapple' condition is not triggered. Integration assessment: All members demonstrated identical analytical competency in recognizing instruction hierarchy. Final validation: The definitive answer 'Guava' is unanimously supported with high confidence.",
