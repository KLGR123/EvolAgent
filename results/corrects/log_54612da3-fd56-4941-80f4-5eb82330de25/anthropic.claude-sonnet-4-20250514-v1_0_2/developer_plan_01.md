## Plan Content
```
Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/54612da3-fd56-4941-80f4-5eb82330de25.xlsx to extract locomotive data from the North American railroad museum collection. Identify all steam locomotives in the collection by examining locomotive types, wheel configurations, or other identifying characteristics, then calculate the total number of wheels for all steam locomotives listed.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the Excel file structure and identify which locomotives are steam engines before counting wheels, (2) No previous analysis has been performed on this file, (3) Expected outcome is to have complete locomotive inventory with steam engines identified and their wheel counts extracted, (4) This provides the foundation needed to calculate the total wheel count for steam locomotives as requested in the TASK

    "description": "Initial exploration of the North American railroad museum Excel file to understand its structure and identify steam locomotives. This step examines the file using both openpyxl for detailed cell-level analysis and pandas for data manipulation. The code searches for locomotive-related keywords in headers and data, identifies potential steam locomotive indicators (like 'steam', wheel configurations), and provides comprehensive output showing the file structure. This analysis will help identify which columns contain locomotive types, wheel configurations, and other identifying characteristics needed to classify steam locomotives and calculate their total wheel count. The results are saved to workspace/locomotive_museum_analysis_initial.json for reference in subsequent analysis steps.",

    "feedback": "Partial success - Code executed without errors and successfully analyzed the Excel file structure, identifying locomotive data with clear steam/diesel categories. The analysis revealed 7 steam locomotives with wheel configurations (0-4-0, 0-4-0, 4-4-0, 2-6-0, 2-8-0, 2-6-4, 2-8-4) and properly distinguished them from diesel locomotives. However, the **PLAN** requirement to calculate the total number of wheels for all steam locomotives was not completed - the code only identified the configurations but didn't perform the wheel counting calculation. **PLAN** alignment: 80% complete. Next step: Add wheel counting logic to parse each wheel configuration (e.g., '2-8-4' = 2+8+4 = 14 wheels) and sum the total wheels across all 7 steam locomotives to complete the analysis.",

    "description": "Complete analysis of the North American railroad museum Excel file to identify steam locomotives and calculate their total wheel count. This code loads the locomotive data, filters out category headers ('Steam', 'Diesel'), and identifies steam locomotives by their wheel configuration patterns (e.g., '0-4-0', '2-8-4'). For each steam locomotive, it parses the wheel configuration string to extract individual wheel counts and sums them up. The analysis found 7 steam locomotives with configurations: 0-4-0 (4 wheels), 0-4-0 (4 wheels), 4-4-0 (8 wheels), 2-6-0 (8 wheels), 2-8-0 (10 wheels), 2-6-4 (12 wheels), and 2-8-4 (14 wheels). The code provides detailed breakdown of calculations for each locomotive and saves comprehensive results to workspace/steam_locomotive_wheel_analysis.json. This completes the PLAN by identifying all steam locomotives and calculating the total number of wheels across the entire steam locomotive collection.",
