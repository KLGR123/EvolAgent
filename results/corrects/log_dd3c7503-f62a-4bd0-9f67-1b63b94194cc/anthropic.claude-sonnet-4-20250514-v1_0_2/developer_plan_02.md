# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** dd3c7503-f62a-4bd0-9f67-1b63b94194cc  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-31 20:24:32

## Plan Content
```
Calculate how many cups of honey need to be removed from a gallon of honey so that the remaining honey weighs less than a gallon of mayonnaise. Use the density values obtained from LibreTexts: honey = 1.42 g/cm³ and mayonnaise = 0.91 g/cm³ at 25°C. Convert gallon and cup measurements to consistent units, calculate the initial weights of both substances, then determine how many cup-sized removals are needed until the honey's remaining weight becomes less than the mayonnaise weight.
```

## Plan Description
```
This calculation step is necessary because: (1) We have successfully obtained the required density values from the specified LibreTexts materials in the previous step, (2) The developer confirmed honey density = 1.42 g/cm³ and mayonnaise density = 0.91 g/cm³ at 25°C from the CK-12 licensed sources, (3) Expected outcome is to determine the exact number of cup removals needed through weight comparison calculations, (4) This directly answers the TASK question about how many times cups must be removed before honey weighs less than mayonnaise

### Development Step 2: Calculate ISBN-10 Check Digit for Tropicos ID 100370510

**Description**: Calculate the ISBN-10 check digit for the Tropicos ID 100370510. Apply the standard ISBN-10 check digit algorithm: multiply each digit by its position weight (1st digit × 10, 2nd digit × 9, 3rd digit × 8, etc.), sum all products, find the remainder when divided by 11, and determine the check digit (0-9 or X for remainder 10). Save the complete calculation process and final check digit result to workspace for verification.

**Use Cases**:
- Library cataloging validation and metadata enrichment for herbarium specimens using Tropicos IDs to generate accurate ISBN-10 entries and avoid data entry errors
- Automated ISBN-10 generation in publishing house workflows when referencing Tropicos plant identifiers in monographs to ensure compliance with international book numbering standards
- Batch integration of Tropicos-to-ISBN-10 conversion in online botanical bookstores to synchronize product listings with global bibliographic databases and improve search accuracy
- Migration of legacy botanical database records by verifying and appending ISBN-10 check digits to Tropicos IDs, preserving data integrity during system upgrades
- Embedding ISBN-10 check digit calculations in university citation management tools for researchers citing plant taxonomy sources, reducing manual correction time in bibliographies
- Digital archiving scripts for botanical gardens that process Tropicos specimen IDs, automatically computing and storing ISBN-10 numbers for public access repositories
- Nightly quality assurance tasks in taxonomic publishing platforms that recalculate ISBN-10 check digits for new plant taxonomy publications, flagging discrepancies for editorial review
- Teaching computer science and data validation principles by demonstrating the ISBN-10 check digit algorithm on real-world Tropicos IDs in academic programming courses

### Development Step 1: Family Reunion Attendance Analysis and Potato Needs in 5-Pound Bags

**Description**: Systematically analyze the family reunion attendee list to determine the exact number of adults and children attending. Parse through each family group mentioned: (1) Your parents (married mother and father), (2) Your twin brother and his family (brother + spouse + 2 children), (3) Your aunt and her family (aunt + spouse + 1 six-year-old), (4) Your grandma and her brother, (5) Her brother's daughter and her family (daughter + spouse + 3 kids under 12), plus yourself. Account for the deceased members (grandpa and grandma's sister-in-law) and the special dietary restriction (second cousins don't eat carbs). Calculate total potato consumption using the given rates: 1.5 potatoes per adult, 0.5 potatoes per child (except carb-free second cousins), convert to pounds using 0.5 pounds per potato, and determine how many 5-pound bags are needed.

**Use Cases**:
- Corporate retreat catering and side-dish provisioning for a multinational team with low-carb and child-friendly meal options
- Summer camp weekly meal planning and potato supply calculation for campers, counselors, and gluten-free participants
- Wedding reception menu and ingredient ordering automation accounting for adults, children, and guests with dietary restrictions
- School field trip lunch box assembly and snack pack distribution for students with allergen exclusions and teacher chaperones
- Hospital inpatient meal scheduling and tuber-based side dish forecasting across adult and pediatric wards with diabetic diet exclusions
- Military training camp mess hall resource forecasting and bulk potato ordering considering soldiers and trainees on low‐carb rations
- Non-profit community soup kitchen stock planning and vegetable procurement tailored to adult visitors, families, and carb-free volunteers
- Restaurant chain brunch service potato side dish inventory management and automated ordering report generation for multiple locations

### Development Step 6: ASEAN Capitals Distance Matrix and Farthest Pair Identification via Haversine Formula

**Description**: Calculate the geographical distances between all possible pairs of ASEAN capital cities using the coordinate data from workspace/asean_complete_coordinates.json. Apply the haversine formula to compute great circle distances between each pair of capitals, then identify which two countries have the maximum distance between their capital cities. Create a comprehensive distance matrix showing all pairwise distances and determine the two ASEAN member countries whose capitals are geographically furthest apart.

**Use Cases**:
- Logistics route optimization for freight companies calculating the shortest shipping legs between ASEAN capitals to minimize transit time and fuel costs
- Government travel coordination for foreign affairs offices scheduling official visits and arranging the most efficient travel routes between member-state capitals
- Travel agency itinerary planning for multi-city Southeast Asia tours, using capital-to-capital distances to design balanced schedules and pricing models
- Emergency response modeling for disaster relief organizations estimating rapid deployment times between ASEAN capitals during regional crises
- Airline network analysis for carriers evaluating the feasibility and demand of direct flights connecting underserved ASEAN capitals
- Retail distribution strategy for consumer goods companies determining optimal warehouse locations based on proximity to multiple ASEAN capitals
- Sports event logistics planning for regional tournaments, coordinating team travel and accommodation by assessing inter-capital distances
- Environmental impact studies for researchers mapping pollutant dispersion corridors between capitals to inform cross-border air quality policies

Using the LibreTexts density values (honey = 1.42 g/cm³, mayonnaise = 0.91 g/cm³ at 25°C), I'll convert volumes to consistent units (cm³), calculate initial weights using mass = density × volume, determine the weight difference that needs to be removed, and calculate how many cup-sized portions are required. The approach includes comprehensive verification by checking weights before and after removal, plus detailed output files saved to workspace/ for validation. This systematic calculation will provide the exact number of cups needed to make honey lighter than mayonnaise.",
