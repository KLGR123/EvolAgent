# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Search for books authored by James Beard Award winners that specifically recommend Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant in Albuquerque. Focus on finding the complete title of the book that mentions this restaurant, paying special attention to any numbers in the title that need to be written in plain text format as requested in the TASK.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) Previous research successfully identified Ali Khan's show 'Cheap Eats' (2015) and the specific New Mexican restaurant Papa Felipe's in Albuquerque where he enjoyed authentic New Mexican cuisine, (2) The developer found that Papa Felipe's was mentioned by James Beard Award-winning food journalists in 2009, but the specific book title was not identified, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the exact book title by James Beard Award winners that recommended Papa Felipe's, with proper formatting of any numbers in plain text, (4) This final search will complete the TASK by providing the complete book title as requested
