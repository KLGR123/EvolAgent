  "final_answer": "Five Hundred Things to Eat Before It's Too Late",
  "reason": "Task decomposition: Identify Ali Khan's 2015 cost-conscious TV show, locate New Mexican restaurant episode, find James Beard Award winners' book recommending that restaurant, and format numbers as plain text. Individual member evaluation: Members 1 and 2 both conducted systematic research identifying 'Cheap Eats' (2015) as Ali Khan's show, Season 1 Episode 3 (Albuquerque) as the New Mexico episode, and Papa Felipe's Mexican Restaurant as the establishment where he enjoyed New Mexican staples including sopaipilla with carne adovada and green chile cheeseburger. Both members identified Jane and Michael Stern as three-time James Beard Award winners who recommended Papa Felipe's in 'Five Hundred Things to Eat Before It's Too Late' (2009), properly converting '500' to plain text. Member 3 identified the same show and general episode but concluded with Frontier Restaurant and 'The Border Cookbook' by different James Beard winners. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on all key details with extensive documentation, while Member 3 diverged on restaurant identification. Contradiction resolution: Members 1 and 2 provided specific episode details (Season 1, Episode 3) with consistent restaurant identification and book connection, supported by detailed research documentation. Member 3's identification of Frontier Restaurant appears to be based on general Albuquerque restaurant knowledge rather than specific episode analysis. Synthesis evaluation: The Papa Felipe's connection is more thoroughly documented with specific episode references and verified James Beard Award winner book recommendation. Final validation confirms Jane and Michael Stern's established credentials and their 2009 book specifically mentioning Papa Felipe's Chilaquile Casserole.",
