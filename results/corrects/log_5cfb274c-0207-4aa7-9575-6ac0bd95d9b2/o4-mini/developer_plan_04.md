# Developer Plan #4 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 5cfb274c-0207-4aa7-9575-6ac0bd95d9b2  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 4  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 00:40:13

## Plan Content
```
Analyze the adjacency list in workspace/earl_adjacency.json to determine whether there exists a cycle that starts at a given green-cell plot, visits every green-cell plot exactly once, returns to the start without revisiting any intermediate plot, and write the result (boolean existence and, if true, one valid cycle of (row,column) coordinates in order) to workspace/earl_hamiltonian_result.json.
```

## Plan Description
```
This step leverages the constructed adjacency list of Earl Smith’s plots to answer the core TASK: verifying the existence of a non-backtracking full traversal that returns to the start (a Hamiltonian cycle). Achieving this by pathfinding on the adjacency graph directly addresses whether Earl can walk through every plot he owns exactly once and return to his starting plot.

The script loads the JSON, prints the object type, counts top-level entries, and displays up to five sample plot entries with their neighbor lists. It also tries to parse the first key as a (row,column) tuple if keys are coordinate strings. No new files are created in workspace/.

    "feedback": 'Execution incomplete – the code successfully loaded and printed the structure of the adjacency data (49 plots with sample neighbors), but it did not perform any Hamiltonian cycle search or write out the required result. The inspection shows that plot identifiers are stored as strings like "[1,3]", and your simple tuple parsing logic (stripping parentheses) fails on this format.\n\nMain issues:\n1. No Hamiltonian cycle detection logic is implemented – the current script only inspects and prints the adjacency list.\n2. Key parsing fails because the code expects keys of the form “(r,c)” but the JSON uses “[r,c]”.\n\nPlan alignment: 0% of the cycle-finding requirement is met.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Convert the string keys into tuple coordinates correctly. For example, use Python’s ast.literal_eval or strip square brackets (`key.strip(\'[]\')`) before splitting and converting to ints.\n2. Build a graph mapping `Tuple[int,int] -> List[Tuple[int,int]]`.\n3. Implement a backtracking or DFS-based Hamiltonian cycle search that:\n   - Starts at each green-cell plot (or a given start), \n   - Visits every node exactly once, \n   - Returns to the start without revisiting intermediate nodes.\n4. As soon as you find a valid cycle, stop searching, set existence to true, and record the cycle as a list of (row,column) tuples in order.\n5. Write the result JSON with two fields: `"exists"` (boolean) and `"cycle"` (the coordinate list or an empty list) to `workspace/earl_hamiltonian_result.json`.\n\nImplement these steps in the current script so that running it completes the **PLAN**. No further inspection-only code is needed once cycle detection and output writing are in place.',
