# Developer Plan #3 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 5cfb274c-0207-4aa7-9575-6ac0bd95d9b2  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 3  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 00:38:49

## Plan Content
```
Construct an adjacency list for Earl Smith’s plots by reading workspace/earl_plots.json, identifying every pair of green-cell coordinates that share an edge (row difference of 1 with same column or column difference of 1 with same row), and write the resulting adjacency list to workspace/earl_adjacency.json.
```

## Plan Description
```
Building the adjacency list is the next essential step toward determining a Hamiltonian cycle: (1) The green-cell coordinates for Earl’s plots are available in workspace/earl_plots.json, (2) Identifying which plots are neighbors directly supports pathfinding analysis, (3) The expected output is a JSON file mapping each plot to its adjacent plots, (4) This adjacency structure will enable the subsequent algorithmic check for a non-backtracking full-cycle traversal.
```

It also provides a deeper peek into nested structures by examining the first element or key.\n(3) Advances plan by giving visibility into how plots are represented (e.g., list of coordinate pairs, dicts mapping IDs to coordinates, etc.), so the next step can reliably parse and compute adjacency without assumptions.\n(4) Relationship to previous iterations/HISTORY: First pass—no prior iterations; aligning with instructions to avoid blind parsing and to inspect workspace files first.\n(5) No new output files are created in this step. Once the structure is understood, the next iteration will proceed to generate the adjacency list.  ',

Parse the list of coordinate pairs into a set of tuples for O(1) neighbor lookups.\n2. For each coordinate (r, c), check the four possible neighbors: (r+1,c), (r-1,c), (r,c+1), (r,c-1). If a neighbor exists in the set, add it to the adjacency list for (r, c).\n3. Build a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list (e.g., {"[1,3]": [[1,4],[2,3]], ...} or [[1,3, [[1,4],[2,3]]], ...]).\n4.
