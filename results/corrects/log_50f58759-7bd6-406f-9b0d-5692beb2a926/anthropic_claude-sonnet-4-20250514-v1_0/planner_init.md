Key achievements: (1) Successfully located and accessed the correct Nature.com article 'A global population assessment of the Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)' from 2020, (2) Extracted the specific global population figure of 3.42 million breeding pairs with 95th-percentile confidence interval [2.98, 4.00] million breeding pairs, (3) Documented the comprehensive methodology involving satellite imagery, drone (UAS) imagery, and ground counting across 375 extant colonies, (4) Confirmed the measurement unit as breeding pairs (not individual penguins), enabling accurate comparison with Wikipedia 2018 data, (5) Identified this as the first comprehensive global population assessment with high precision confidence intervals. All data has been systematically extracted, verified, and saved to workspace files including 'nature_2020_final_population_data.json' with structured comparison-ready format. The 2020 Nature study provides definitive population data (3.42 million breeding pairs) and methodology details needed for comparison with Wikipedia's 2018 figures, fully satisfying the PLAN requirements.",

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted: (1) Wikipedia 2018 data: 8 million individual chinstrap penguins (IUCN source), (2) Nature.com 2020 study: 3.42 million breeding pairs, which converts to 6.84 million individual penguins (3.42 × 2 penguins per breeding pair), (3) Absolute difference calculation: |8,000,000 - 6,840,000| = 1,160,000 individual penguins, (4) Converting to tens of thousands: 1,160,000 ÷ 10,000 = 116 tens of thousands. Final answer: The absolute difference is 116 tens of thousands.',
