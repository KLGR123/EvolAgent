  "reason": "Task analysis: Identify the longest-lived vertebrate named after an island, then find the 2020 estimated population of that island according to Wikipedia as of January 1, 2021, rounded to the nearest thousand. All three team members identified the Greenland shark as the longest-lived vertebrate, which is named after Greenland island. For the population data, Member 1 accessed an archived Wikipedia page from January 5, 2021 (close to the target date) and found the 2020 population estimate as 56,081, which rounds to 56,000. Member 2 found a population figure of 56,000 (already rounded) but provided less detail about methodology. Member 3 found a slightly different figure of 56,421, which also rounds to 56,000. Cross-analysis shows convergence on the final rounded answer of 56,000, despite slight variations in the exact population figures (56,081 vs 56,421). Member 1 demonstrated the most methodologically sound approach by specifically accessing an archived Wikipedia version from near January 1, 2021, which directly addresses the requirement to use Wikipedia data as of that specific date. The final answer of 56,000 is supported by all three members' findings and represents the 2020 estimated population of Greenland rounded to the nearest thousand.",
