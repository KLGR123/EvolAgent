# Developer Plan #2 - claude-3-7-sonnet-v1

**Task ID:** 3ff6b7a9-a5bd-4412-ad92-0cd0d45c0fee  
**Model:** claude-3-7-sonnet-v1  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-31 11:32:24

## Plan Content
```
Search for the 2020 estimated population of Greenland according to Wikipedia as of January 1, 2021. Focus on finding archived versions of the Wikipedia page for Greenland from early 2021 that would contain the 2020 population estimate. Extract the specific population figure and round it to the nearest thousand as requested in the task.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal next step because: (1) We've already identified from the previous research that the Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate and it's named after Greenland island, (2) Now we need to find the 2020 population estimate for Greenland as it appeared on Wikipedia at the beginning of 2021, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the exact population figure from an archived Wikipedia page dated around January 1, 2021, (4) This directly addresses the remaining requirement of the TASK to find the 2020 estimated population to the nearest thousand

    "description": "This implementation searches for the 2020 estimated population of Greenland according to Wikipedia as of January 1, 2021. The code follows a systematic approach:\n\n1. First, it attempts to access an archived version of the Wikipedia page for Greenland from January 1, 2021 using the Wayback Machine API.\n2. If successful, it downloads and parses the archived HTML to extract the 2020 population figure.\n3. The code uses multiple extraction strategies:\n   - Looking for population data in the Wikipedia infobox\n   - Searching for population sections in the main content\n   - Finding paragraphs that mention 2020 population figures\n4. If the archived version doesn't contain the data, it falls back to checking the current Wikipedia page for historical population data.\n5. Once found, the population figure is extracted, rounded to the nearest thousand, and saved to a JSON file.\n\nThe implementation includes detailed progress reporting and error handling to ensure transparency in the extraction process. All intermediate and final results are saved to the workspace directory for reference and verification.\n\nThis approach is robust because it tries multiple sources (archived and current) and multiple extraction methods (infobox, sections, tables, and paragraphs) to find the requested information.",
