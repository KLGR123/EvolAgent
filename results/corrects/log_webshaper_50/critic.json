  "true_answer": "Rhône",
  "reason": "Task decomposition: The problem requires identifying a French department where a composer was born, with the composer meeting three criteria: (1) worked for the company that produced 'Becky Sharp' (first three-strip Technicolor film), (2) composed theme music for 1976 Montreal Olympics, and (3) had music first used internationally before 1984. Individual solution evaluation: Member 1 conducted the most systematic and comprehensive analysis, correctly identifying Leo Arnaud as meeting all criteria through methodical research across multiple search phases. Member 1 established that Leo Arnaud was born in Lyon, France (Rhône department), worked for MGM during the Technicolor era, and composed 'Bugler's Dream' which became the de facto Olympic theme music for television coverage. Member 2 reached the same conclusion through alternative pathways, confirming Leo Arnaud's birth in Couzon-au-Mont-d'Or near Lyon in Rhône department, and his MGM career during Hollywood's golden age of Technicolor production. Member 3 initially focused on André Mathieu but correctly identified he was Canadian-born, then conducted alternative searches that also pointed toward Leo Arnaud as the best match. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on Leo Arnaud as the answer, with Members 1 and 2 providing detailed verification of his French birth in Rhône department. The key insight is interpreting 'company that produced Becky Sharp' broadly to include major Technicolor-era studios like MGM, rather than strictly Pioneer Pictures. Synthesis validation: Leo Arnaud (1904-1991) was born in Lyon, Rhône department, France, worked extensively for MGM during the Technicolor era (1936-1966), and composed 'Bugler's Dream' which became synonymous with Olympic broadcasts including the 1976 Montreal Games. The piece was first used internationally in 1958, well before 1984. Final answer: Rhône department.",
