**Task ID:** webshaper_50  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 6  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-12 01:13:36

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about Leo Arnaud's birthplace in Lyon, France, to identify the specific French department where Lyon is located. Focus on finding geographical and administrative details about Lyon's location within France's departmental system. Search for keywords including 'Lyon France department administrative division', 'Lyon located which French department', 'Rhône department Lyon France', and 'Lyon geographical location French administrative regions'.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the final step needed to complete the TASK because: (1) Previous research successfully identified Leo Arnaud as the French-born composer who worked in early Hollywood (including Technicolor-era studios like MGM) and whose 'Bugler's Dream' was extensively used as theme music for the 1976 Montreal Olympics broadcasts, (2) Leo Arnaud was confirmed to be born in Lyon, France on July 24, 1904, (3) Expected outcome is to identify which French department contains the city of Lyon, (4) This will provide the final answer to the TASK asking for the name of the French department where the composer was born

### Development Step 2: Identify Gustave Eiffel’s Exact Birthplace: City and Country of His Birth

**Description**: Research Gustave Eiffel's birthplace to determine the specific location where he was born. Search for biographical information about Gustave Eiffel focusing on his birth details, including the exact city and country where he was born. Use search terms like 'Gustave Eiffel birthplace', 'Gustave Eiffel born where', 'Gustave Eiffel biography birth location', and 'Gustave Eiffel birth city France'.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogical research and family-tree validation for historians confirming Gustave Eiffel’s exact birthplace and birth date
- Automated biography content generation for educational e-learning platforms requiring precise city and country details of Eiffel’s early life
- Fact-checking workflows in journalism and publishing to verify historical claims about where Gustave Eiffel was born
- Cultural tourism itinerary enrichment for travel agencies creating guided tours to Eiffel’s birthplace in Dijon, France
- Museum exhibit digital signage and interactive kiosks fetching real-time biographical data on Eiffel’s birth location for visitor engagement
- Knowledge-base augmentation in virtual assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant) enabling accurate responses to “Where was Gustave Eiffel born?”
- Academic research data aggregation tools compiling and analyzing birth location references for scholarly papers on 19th-century French engineers

### Development Step 4: Identify Gustave Eiffel’s exact birthplace city and country

**Description**: Research Gustave Eiffel's birthplace to determine the specific location where he was born. Search for biographical information about Gustave Eiffel focusing on his birth details, including the exact city and country where he was born. Use search terms like 'Gustave Eiffel birthplace', 'Gustave Eiffel born where', 'Gustave Eiffel biography birth location', and 'Gustave Eiffel birth city France'.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated fact-checking of historical biographies for publishing houses to ensure accurate birthplace details before print
- Genealogical research support tool for family historians validating ancestor birth locations with authoritative sources
- Curriculum development assistance for educators needing precise biographical data on historical figures like Gustave Eiffel
- Digital archive management for libraries and museums, automating metadata extraction of birthplaces from multiple online sources
- Travel guide content curation for tour operators integrating verified birthplace information of landmarks’ creators (e.g., Eiffel Tower)
- Academic research workflow automation for historians aggregating and ranking source evidence on personal data points
- Virtual assistant integration for edtech platforms delivering concise, sourced birthplace summaries to students on demand

    "description": "Implementation of targeted search strategy to identify the specific French department where Lyon is located. This code executes comprehensive searches using multiple search engines (Google, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, Brave, Bing, Yahoo, Mojeek) with 8 carefully crafted queries focused on Lyon's administrative geography and departmental divisions within France. The approach includes: (1) Multi-backend search execution with error handling, (2) Real-time relevance analysis using keyword matching for Lyon, department, administrative, France, and geographical indicators, (3) Special detection for 'Rhône' department mentions and 'Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes' region references, (4) Comprehensive result categorization and immediate analysis, (5) Structured JSON output saved to workspace with timestamp for further processing. This advances the plan by gathering authoritative sources about Lyon's location within France's departmental system, specifically targeting the Rhône department identification needed for Leo Arnaud's birthplace context. The search results will be saved as 'lyon_department_search_[timestamp].json' in the workspace directory for subsequent detailed analysis.",

The script successfully executed 7 out of 8 targeted searches (one search failed due to timeout) and collected comprehensive information about Lyon's departmental location. The output clearly identifies that Lyon is located in the Rhône department within the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of France. Key findings include multiple high-relevance results confirming Lyon as the prefecture of the Rhône department, with detailed administrative geography information collected from authoritative sources like Wikipedia and Britannica. The code properly analyzed 56 total results, categorized them by relevance, and identified 29 results mentioning the Rhône department specifically. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all required information about Lyon's French departmental location has been successfully identified and documented. However, the output is quite lengthy (200+ lines) and contains valuable research data. Recommendation: Save the detailed search results to 'workspace/lyon_department_research_summary.txt' for future reference, as this contains comprehensive administrative geography data that answers the research objective completely.",

    "description": "Implementation of comprehensive analysis of Lyon's departmental location search results to extract specific French administrative geography information for Leo Arnaud's birthplace context. This code: (1) Inspects the structure of the previously saved Lyon search results JSON file to understand the data format, (2) Analyzes 56 collected search results focusing on high-relevance findings (5+ relevance score) and authoritative sources, (3) Extracts and validates departmental information confirming Lyon is located in the Rhône department (69) within the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, (4) Creates structured summaries with evidence from Wikipedia, Britannica, and French government sources, (5) Generates Leo Arnaud birthplace context files connecting the composer to Lyon's specific departmental location. This advances the plan by definitively establishing that Leo Arnaud's birthplace of Lyon is in the Rhône department of France, providing the precise administrative geography context requested. Output files include detailed research summary, Leo Arnaud context, and simple text answer formats saved to workspace directory.",
