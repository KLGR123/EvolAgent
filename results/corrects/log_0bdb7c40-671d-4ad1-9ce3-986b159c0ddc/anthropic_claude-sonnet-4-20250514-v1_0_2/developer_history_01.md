The code includes extensive print statements to show the extraction progress and findings, making it easy for the tester to verify that we're successfully accessing the correct APOD entry and identifying the two astronauts with the size difference effect.",

Charles \'Pete\' Conrad appears much smaller as a reflection in Bean\'s helmet visor, along with the lunar horizon. This creates the dramatic size difference effect where one astronaut (Conrad) appears much smaller than the other (Bean) due to the perspective - Bean fills the frame as the main subject while Conrad is visible only as a small reflection in the helmet.\n\n**Complete APOD Content Extracted:**\n- Full title and description documenting this as a masterpiece of space photography\n- Image details and source path\n- Credit information identifying Charles Conrad as photographer\n- Complete explanation text describing the lunar soil collection activities\n- Mission context: Apollo 12, November 1969, Moon\'s Ocean of Storms\n\nAll required information has been successfully extracted and saved to workspace files (HTML, text, and JSON formats).
