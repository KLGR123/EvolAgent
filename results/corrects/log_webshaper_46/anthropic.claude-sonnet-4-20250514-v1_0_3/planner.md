Notts County inspired Juventus\' signature black and white striped kit design. This is confirmed by Goal.com and multiple football history sources with the specific evidence: "The Italian giants are known for their signature black-and-white zebra stripes on their kits - and Notts County have something to do with it."\n\n**PLAN OBJECTIVE 3 - COMPLETED**: Cross-reference of historical kit donation story confirmed - Notts County → Juventus kit inspiration (1903) with black and white stripes connection established through multiple search results.\n\n**SEARCH EXECUTION STATUS**: The comprehensive search strategy successfully executed 8+ targeted API queries across multiple iterations, finding highly relevant results from authoritative sources (Wikipedia, Goal.com, sports news).
