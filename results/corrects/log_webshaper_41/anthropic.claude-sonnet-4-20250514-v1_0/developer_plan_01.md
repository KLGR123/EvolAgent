# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_41  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-10 12:49:45

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about London international airports that have installed or feature energy harvesting floor tiles. Focus on identifying which specific London airport (likely Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, or Luton) has implemented energy harvesting floor tile technology. Look for news articles, press releases, airport sustainability reports, or technology implementation announcements that mention energy harvesting floors at London airports. This will help narrow down which airport submitted expansion proposals that included energy harvesting infrastructure.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify which specific London international airport features energy harvesting floor tiles before we can search for their expansion proposals, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the specific airport and understand their energy harvesting floor tile implementation, (4) This directly addresses the first requirement of identifying the airport before we can trace their expansion proposal submission timeline and assessment outcome

### Development Step 1: Identify City Granted October 2019 Planning Permission for Homeless Shelter-to-Flats Conversion near Bournemouth

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the city where a developer received planning permission in October 2019 to convert a homeless shelter into flats. Focus on searching for news articles, planning applications, and local government records from October 2019 using keywords like 'October 2019 planning permission homeless shelter flats conversion', 'homeless shelter converted flats October 2019', and 'planning permission shelter housing development 2019'. Cross-reference results with locations that have Bournemouth Seafront areas containing Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th century historic villas, and conservation areas designated in 1987.

**Use Cases**:
- Urban development due diligence and site feasibility reports for real estate investors seeking post-2019 conversion opportunities
- Automated permit monitoring and alert system for local council planning officers tracking homeless shelter redevelopments
- Heritage conservation compliance checks for architects working on historic villa conversions in designated 1987 conservation areas
- Legal due diligence toolkit for property lawyers compiling planning application histories and decision notices for October 2019 developments
- Investigative journalism workflows for housing reporters analyzing social impact of shelter-to-flat conversions in seafront communities
- Academic case study preparation for urban planning students researching adaptive reuse projects around Bournemouth’s Russell-Cotes precinct
- Competitive intelligence extraction for residential developers benchmarking October 2019 planning permissions on East Cliff Lift vicinity
- GIS-enabled analysis pipeline for smart-city teams mapping redevelopment trends and regulatory zones along UK coastal conservation areas

### Development Step 2: Find City with October 2019 Planning Permission for Homeless Shelter-to-Flats Conversion

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the city where a developer received planning permission in October 2019 to convert a homeless shelter into flats. Focus on searching for news articles, planning applications, and local government records from October 2019 using keywords like 'October 2019 planning permission homeless shelter flats conversion', 'homeless shelter converted flats October 2019', and 'planning permission shelter housing development 2019'. Cross-reference results with locations that have Bournemouth Seafront areas containing Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th century historic villas, and conservation areas designated in 1987.

**Use Cases**:
- Real estate investment due diligence: automatically extract and verify October 2019 planning permissions for property conversions (e.g., homeless shelter to flats) to assess redevelopment opportunities in Bournemouth and similar coastal towns
- Urban planning research and heritage conservation: cross-reference local government records with landmark datasets (Russell-Cotes Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th-century villas) to study the impact of conservation areas designated in 1987 on new developments
- Automated news media fact-checking: scan and analyze web articles for developer names, planning permission dates, and locations to validate claims about high-profile projects (e.g., Harry Redknapp’s Pierfront Properties approval)
- Government transparency dashboards: aggregate and visualize planning application outcomes by date, developer, and city (such as Bournemouth in October 2019) to support public policy analysis and citizen engagement
- Legal property compliance monitoring: track the approval status of planning permissions for former homeless accommodations to ensure developers comply with council conditions and heritage requirements
- Tourism and cultural guide enrichment: verify the presence of specific landmarks and recent development changes (flats conversion, conservation areas) when generating up-to-date travel guides for Bournemouth’s seafront attractions
- Social impact assessment for NGOs: compile and analyze data on shelter-to-housing conversion projects approved in 2019 to report on local homelessness alleviation efforts and inform funding decisions

### Development Step 10: Search Harry Kewell’s Crawley Town managerial record and win-loss statistics since May 2017

**Description**: Search for Harry Kewell's complete managerial record at Crawley Town, focusing on his win-loss statistics during his tenure from May 2017 onwards. Search for keywords including 'Harry Kewell Crawley Town managerial record wins', 'Harry Kewell Crawley statistics manager', 'Crawley Town Harry Kewell results 2017-2018', and 'Harry Kewell manager win percentage Crawley'. Look for official club records, sports databases, or detailed match reports that document the total number of games won during his time as manager of Crawley Town.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated sports journalism workflows: extract and compile football manager records (games managed, wins, win rates, tenure) from online search snippets into JSON for rapid article publication.
- Football club recruitment analysis: process historical managerial performance data—total games, win percentages, league positions—to inform candidate evaluations and hiring decisions.
- Sports betting analytics integration: aggregate manager and team performance stats into predictive models by scraping win-loss records and win rates from web search results.

This search targets the four major London international airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton) using 12 different query strategies to find news articles, press releases, sustainability reports, or technology announcements about energy harvesting floor installations. The code uses DDGS search with UK region targeting and multiple search backends for comprehensive coverage. Each result is analyzed for relevance using airport names, energy harvesting terms, sustainability keywords, and infrastructure terms. Results are scored and categorized by relevance level, with detailed analysis of airport-specific mentions. All search results are saved to workspace/london_airports_energy_harvesting_search_[timestamp].json for further analysis. The search focuses on identifying which specific London airport has implemented this technology as part of expansion proposals or sustainability initiatives.',

A company called Pavegen has developed (and patented) floor tiles that harvest the kinetic energy from human footsteps and use it to directly power off-grid applications such as lighting, wayfinding and advertisement boards — or store it in an external battery for powering future applications. Feb 26, 2025 · One of the most notable installations is at London ’s Heathrow Airport , where kinetic tiles capture the footsteps of thousands of travelers each day, generating power for nearby lighting. Are energy-harvesting tiles transforming high-traffic spaces? Energy-harvesting tiles are already transforming high-traffic spaces . In London’s West End, Pavegen installed tiles on Bird Street, using footsteps to power streetlights and speakers. At the 2013 Paris Marathon, runners helped illuminate event signage with each step. Can kinetic tiles help make airport operations more sustainable? At Heathrow Airport , kinetic tiles tested in passenger walkways explored how footsteps might support airport operations. As cities push for greener solutions, these tiles could become common in train stations, bus stops, and shopping centers. By turning everyday movement into power, they offer a simple way to make urban spaces more sustainable. How do PaveGen floor tiles work? Imagine every step you take generating electricity—that’s the magic behind Pavegen’s innovative floor tiles. These tiles harness kinetic energy from footsteps , converting it into usable power. Each footstep produces a small but measurable amount of energy, enough to power LED lights or sensors. How do PaveGen energy harvesting tiles work? Pavegen’s energy - harvesting tiles work through a simple process. When someone steps on a tile, the surface flexes slightly, triggering a flywheel system underneath. This movement converts kinetic energy into rotational energy , which then powers a generator. The generator produces a small but steady flow of electricity. What are some examples of energy efficient tiles? One such example includes an installation at the University of Birmingham which generates enough power to allow students to be able to charge their mobile phones at a nearby charging station (6) Pavegen has also created a more efficient triangular shaped tile versus their initial square tile.

    "description": "Analysis of the search results from the previous step to identify which London airport has energy harvesting floor tiles. Based on the tester feedback, the search successfully found 79 results and identified Heathrow Airport as having Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles installed in walkways and hallways. This code first inspects the structure of the search results file to understand its format, then systematically analyzes the results to extract evidence about Heathrow Airport's energy harvesting floor tile installation. The analysis focuses on Heathrow-specific results and Pavegen company mentions to build a comprehensive evidence summary. Key findings include Pavegen's official case study featuring Heathrow Airport, multiple tech articles confirming the walkway installation, and research papers citing Heathrow as an example of energy harvesting implementation. The code saves a final analysis confirming Heathrow Airport as the London international airport with energy harvesting floor tiles, which addresses the PLAN's objective of identifying which airport likely submitted expansion proposals including energy harvesting infrastructure.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - NameError occurred due to undefined variable 'combined_text' at line 111 in the analysis loop. The code successfully loaded and began processing the search results file (144 results from 12 queries), correctly identified the file structure, and started analyzing results for London airports with energy harvesting floor tiles. It found 27 Heathrow mentions, 45 Pavegen mentions, and 21 high-relevance results, which strongly indicates Heathrow Airport is the answer. However, the code crashed when processing the definitive evidence section due to a scoping issue with the 'combined_text' variable. **PLAN** alignment: 85% - successfully identified Heathrow as the London airport with energy harvesting floor tiles based on multiple sources mentioning Pavegen installations, but failed to complete the final analysis. Recommended fix: Move the 'combined_text' variable definition outside the conditional check or ensure it's properly defined in the scope where it's being used in the generator expression.",

    "description": "Fixed the variable scoping issue by properly defining 'combined_text' within the appropriate scope for each result being processed. This code analyzes the comprehensive search results from the previous step to identify which London airport has energy harvesting floor tiles. The analysis processes 144 search results from 12 different queries, finding 27 Heathrow mentions, 45 Pavegen mentions, and 21 high-relevance results. The code systematically examines each result to extract definitive evidence about Heathrow Airport's energy harvesting floor tile installation by Pavegen Systems. Key findings include multiple sources confirming Pavegen's footfall-powered walkway at Heathrow where each step powers interactive lighting, kinetic tiles in passenger walkways capturing footsteps from thousands of travelers, and official Pavegen case studies featuring Heathrow Airport. The analysis concludes that Heathrow Airport is the London international airport with energy harvesting floor tiles, making it the likely candidate for expansion proposals including energy harvesting infrastructure. All findings are saved to a comprehensive analysis file in the workspace.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - NameError occurred due to undefined variable 'combined_text' at line 111. The code successfully loaded the search results file containing 144 results from 12 queries and began analyzing them effectively. It correctly identified key findings: 27 Heathrow mentions, 45 Pavegen mentions, and 21 high-relevance results, which strongly indicates Heathrow Airport has energy harvesting floor tiles. The code was processing definitive evidence when it crashed due to a variable scoping issue - 'combined_text' was defined inside the main loop but referenced in a generator expression within a conditional check. **PLAN** alignment: 85% - successfully identified Heathrow as the London airport with Pavegen energy harvesting floor tiles based on multiple sources, but failed to complete the comprehensive analysis and final summary. Recommended fix: Define 'combined_text' variable before the conditional check that uses it, or restructure the definitive evidence detection logic to avoid the scoping conflict.",

    "description": "Fixed the variable scoping issue by restructuring the analysis logic to avoid generator expressions that reference variables outside their scope. This code properly analyzes the comprehensive search results from the previous step to identify which London airport has energy harvesting floor tiles. The analysis processes 144 search results from 12 different queries, systematically categorizing results into Heathrow mentions, Pavegen mentions, high-relevance results, and definitive evidence. By moving the definitive evidence detection into the main processing loop, I've eliminated the scoping conflicts that were causing the NameError. The code identifies definitive evidence by checking for results that mention both Pavegen and Heathrow along with energy harvesting terms. Key findings include multiple sources confirming Pavegen's energy harvesting floor tiles at Heathrow Airport in passenger walkways, where footsteps are converted into electricity for interactive lighting. The analysis concludes that Heathrow Airport is the London international airport with energy harvesting floor tiles, making it the answer to the PLAN's objective of identifying which airport likely submitted expansion proposals including energy harvesting infrastructure.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the comprehensive analysis of London airports with energy harvesting floor tiles. The analysis processed 144 search results from 12 targeted queries and successfully identified Heathrow Airport as the definitive answer. Key findings include 27 Heathrow mentions, 45 Pavegen mentions, and 21 high-relevance results with multiple definitive evidence sources confirming Pavegen Systems installed energy harvesting floor tiles in Heathrow's passenger walkways and hallways. The tiles convert footsteps into electricity for interactive lighting, with official Pavegen case studies and multiple independent sources confirming this installation. The analysis found no similar definitive evidence for other London airports (Gatwick, Stansted, Luton). **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - successfully identified Heathrow Airport as the London international airport with energy harvesting floor tile technology. Final comprehensive analysis saved to workspace/heathrow_energy_harvesting_tiles_final_analysis.json. No further development needed - the PLAN objective has been fully achieved.",

    "description": "PLAN COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY. The comprehensive search and analysis has definitively identified Heathrow Airport as the London international airport that has installed energy harvesting floor tiles. Key findings from the analysis of 144 search results across 12 targeted queries include: (1) 27 Heathrow mentions, 45 Pavegen mentions, and 21 high-relevance results, (2) 10 definitive evidence sources confirming Pavegen Systems installed energy harvesting floor tiles in Heathrow's passenger walkways and hallways, (3) Official Pavegen case study specifically featuring Heathrow Airport with footfall-powered walkways where each step powers interactive lighting, (4) Multiple independent sources including tech articles, research papers, and news articles confirming the installation, (5) No similar definitive evidence found for other London airports (Gatwick, Stansted, Luton). The final comprehensive analysis has been saved to workspace/heathrow_energy_harvesting_tiles_final_analysis.json. Heathrow Airport is therefore the London international airport that likely submitted expansion proposals including energy harvesting infrastructure, fully addressing the PLAN's objective to identify which specific London airport has implemented this technology.",
