# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 6b078778-0b90-464d-83f6-59511c811b01  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-02 22:02:08

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about the Metropolitan Museum of Art portrait with accession number 29.100.5. Look for the artwork's title, subject, artist, and any available metadata from the Met's online collection database. Focus on identifying who is depicted in this portrait and gathering complete details about the artwork including its description, provenance, and historical context.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific portrait and its subject before we can research the consecrators and co-consecrators, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the artwork details and identify the bishop depicted in the portrait, (4) This establishes the foundation for subsequently researching the ecclesiastical figures involved in the subject's consecration as bishop

### Development Step 3: Find Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski’s Character in ‘Magda M.’ via Cast and Filmography Search

**Description**: Search for information about the actor Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski's role in the production 'Magda M.' to identify which character he played. Focus on finding cast information, filmography details, or production records through multiple search approaches: (1) Search for 'Bartłomiej Kasprzykowski Magda M. cast character role', (2) Look for Polish film/TV databases or IMDb entries for 'Magda M.' production, (3) Search for Kasprzykowski's complete filmography to identify his role in 'Magda M.', (4) Check Polish entertainment sources or production company information about 'Magda M.' casting. Extract the character name he portrayed in this production to complete the task.

**Use Cases**:
- Entertainment database enrichment and automated character role extraction for actor profiles in online movie encyclopedias

### Development Step 1: 20th Century Post-1977 Malko Competition Winners with Nationalities: Comprehensive Data Compilation

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic musicology research on post-1977 Malko Competition winners to analyze Cold War era nationality trends among laureates from former Soviet and Eastern Bloc states
- Digital library and archive curation workflows automating extraction and integration of Malko Competition winner metadata (names, years, defunct-country nationalities) into institutional catalogs
- Cultural policy assessment by government arts councils using historical winner data to evaluate the evolution of artistic support for musicians from now-dissolved states like Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia
- Museum and exhibition planning teams sourcing chronological recipient lists to create interactive displays on classical music heritage and geopolitical change from 1978 to 2000
- Music journalism and editorial projects compiling comprehensive timelines of Malko laureates for feature articles, anniversary retrospectives, and documentary scripts
- Library management system enhancements leveraging automated scraping routines to maintain up-to-date competition records and link laureate profiles across successor states of the former USSR
- Data journalism investigations visualizing shifts in international competition representation by mapping winner nationalities against historical state boundaries
- Grant evaluation committees benchmarking past competition winners’ trajectories by nationality to design equitable selection criteria for emerging classical musicians

### Development Step 3: Post-1977 20th-Century Malko Competition Winners: Names, Years, Nationalities (Including Defunct States)

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated compilation of Malko Competition winners by nationality for a musicology research paper on post-1977 European conductor trends
- Cultural heritage data enrichment in a digital library to tag and cross-reference 20th-century competition laureates
- Historical geopolitical analysis of USSR and Yugoslavian artists for a Cold War-era performing arts exhibition catalogue
- University curriculum development tool that aggregates real-world competition results to build case studies in conducting courses
- Classical music streaming platform feature that auto-generates artist profiles with competition wins and former-country origins
- Grant-writing support system for arts foundations, pre-filling applicant profiles with past prize data sorted by year and historical nationality
- Automated archival metadata creation for national music archives, extracting structured winner records from public web sources

### Development Step 4: Compile All Post-1977 Malko Competition Winners with Nationalities, Including Defunct Countries

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Archiving and trend analysis for music historians mapping post-1977 Malko Competition winners by nationality and geopolitical context
- Classical music database enrichment with automated extraction of winner names, years, and historical country tags for digital library platforms
- Academic research into Cold War–era cultural exchanges, using detailed Malko Competition data for musicology theses on geopolitical influences
- Museum exhibition curation displaying Malko Competition laureates from defunct states (USSR, Yugoslavia, etc.) to illustrate 20th-century political shifts
- Government cultural policy evaluation assessing how nation-state transformations impacted participation and success rates in international music contests
- University course material development, creating interactive timelines of Malko Competition winners tied to historical country changes for world history or music studies
- Record label marketing analytics identifying award-winning artists’ regional origins and historical backgrounds to drive targeted promotional campaigns

    "description": "This is the initial research phase for finding Metropolitan Museum of Art portrait with accession number 29.100.5. I'm implementing a multi-strategy approach: (1) Using the Met's official Collection API to search for the accession number and retrieve detailed object metadata, (2) Searching the Met's website directly for the artwork, (3) Using Google search as a backup to find any references to this specific accession number. The code systematically tries each approach, saves all raw data to workspace files for analysis, and provides detailed progress reporting. This comprehensive search strategy will help identify the portrait's title, subject, artist, and complete metadata from the Met's collection database. All responses are saved to workspace files for subsequent detailed analysis.",

The Met Museum API search successfully identified accession number 29.100.5 as 'Cardinal Fernando Niño de Guevara (1541–1609)' by El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos) in the European Paintings department. This directly fulfills the core **PLAN** requirements: we now have the artwork's title, subject (Cardinal Fernando Niño de Guevara), and artist (El Greco). The code generated comprehensive data files including detailed object metadata (15,912 bytes) and search results (338,318 bytes). **PLAN** alignment: 80% complete - we have the essential identification information. Next step: Extract and display the complete metadata from the detailed JSON file to show the full description, provenance, and historical context that was collected but not yet presented in readable format.",
