# Developer Plan #3 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_69  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 3  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-12 08:00:51

## Plan Content
```
Search for Dennis Flemion's complete date of birth including the specific day and month, not just the birth year (1955) that was previously found. Focus on finding detailed biographical information, band histories, music databases, or other sources that contain his full birth date in day/month/year format to provide the complete answer requested in the original task.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary final step because: (1) Previous research successfully identified Dennis Flemion of The Frogs as the member who filled in as keyboardist for The Family (Prince's side project) and found his birth year as 1955, (2) The original TASK specifically asks for 'date of birth' which typically requires the complete date including day and month, not just the year, (3) Expected outcome is to find Dennis Flemion's full birth date in complete format (e.g., January 15, 1955), (4) This will provide the precise answer needed to fully complete the TASK with the specific date of birth requested

### Development Step 16: Search and Verify Chen Boda‚Äôs Death Year via Multiple Reliable Biographical Sources

**Description**: Search for the death year of Chen Boda, who was born in Hui'an County, Fujian Province (a region known for China's national intangible cultural heritage stone carving techniques), authored extensive critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and served as Mao Zedong's chief interpreter and ghostwriter. Focus on finding reliable biographical information about Chen Boda's death date, including searches for 'Chen Boda death year', 'Chen Boda biography died', and 'Chen Boda Èôà‰ºØËææ death date'. Cross-reference multiple sources to confirm the exact year of his death.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogical research and extraction of ancestor birth/death dates from digitized family archive HTML files
- Corporate compliance auditing by identifying and verifying regulatory document expiry dates across JSON and HTML repositories
- Academic library catalog enhancement by indexing author death years from scholarly biography web pages
- Museum curation workflow automation to compile artist life spans from exhibition program HTML files
- Medical records analysis to detect patient death dates in archived discharge summaries and clinical notes
- Historical data compilation of war veteran death anniversaries from government archive HTML and JSON sources
- Entertainment industry database enrichment by scraping and confirming actor obituary dates from celebrity news sites
- Insurance claim validation through automated extraction of policyholder death dates in claim documentation files

### Development Step 14: Identify the French Department Where Andr√© Mathieu Was Born

**Description**: Search for information about Andr√© Mathieu's birthplace in France, specifically identifying the French department where he was born. Focus on finding biographical details about this Canadian composer (1929-1968) whose works were used for the 1976 Montreal Olympics theme music. Search for keywords including 'Andr√© Mathieu composer birthplace France department', 'Andr√© Mathieu born France which department', 'Andr√© Mathieu biography birth location French department', and cross-reference with French geographical administrative divisions to identify the specific department name.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogical research automation for family historians verifying ancestors‚Äô birthplaces across multiple archival databases by inspecting local files and performing targeted web searches
- Journalistic fact-checking workflow for newsrooms to validate public figures‚Äô biographical details (birth dates, birthplaces) and correct misinformation before publishing articles
- Academic metadata curation for university libraries to accurately populate composer and author profiles by cross-referencing JSON/text records with live search engine verification
- Cultural heritage documentation process for museum archivists confirming artists‚Äô life events and birth locations when preparing exhibition catalogs and digital archives
- Legal compliance due diligence for financial institutions to verify clients‚Äô personal data (e.g., birthplaces and dates) against multiple authoritative sources to meet KYC/AML regulations
- Content accuracy assurance for online encyclopedias to automate detection and correction of incorrect biographical entries using structured file inspection and verification queries
- Education scholarship eligibility screening for academic committees to confirm applicants‚Äô birthplaces and residency status by aggregating and summarizing evidence from official records and web sources

### Development Step 13: Locate and Confirm Chen Boda‚Äôs Death Year from Reliable Biographical Sources

**Description**: Search for the death year of Chen Boda, who was born in Hui'an County, Fujian Province (a region known for China's national intangible cultural heritage stone carving techniques), authored extensive critiques against Chiang Kai-shek's political works, and served as Mao Zedong's chief interpreter and ghostwriter. Focus on finding reliable biographical information about Chen Boda's death date, including searches for 'Chen Boda death year', 'Chen Boda biography died', and 'Chen Boda Èôà‰ºØËææ death date'. Cross-reference multiple sources to confirm the exact year of his death.

**Use Cases**:
- Genealogy research automation for family historians: extracting and verifying death dates of ancestors from digitized local archives and memorial websites.
- Historical archive metadata enrichment for librarians: automatically identifying and updating death year fields in digital collections of political figures‚Äô biographies.
- Academic research on political elite longevity: aggregating and cross-referencing death years of mid-20th century Chinese leaders to study lifespan patterns.
- Journalistic fact-checking for obituary writing: quickly confirming the death date of prominent figures by scanning saved news article HTML and authoritative biographical sources.
- Educational publishing timeline validation: ensuring history textbook publishers have accurate death years for Mao Zedong‚Äôs inner circle when compiling political chronology.
- Cultural heritage database curation: verifying biographical details (including death year) of practitioners in regional stone carving traditions to maintain national intangible cultural heritage records.
- Compliance due-diligence in international partnerships: risk analysts confirming the life status and death information of prospective foreign business associates with politically sensitive backgrounds.

### Development Step 15: Search Andr√© Mathieu‚Äôs French Birthplace: Identify Department for 1976 Montreal Olympics Theme Music

**Description**: Search for information about Andr√© Mathieu's birthplace in France, specifically identifying the French department where he was born. Focus on finding biographical details about this Canadian composer (1929-1968) whose works were used for the 1976 Montreal Olympics theme music. Search for keywords including 'Andr√© Mathieu composer birthplace France department', 'Andr√© Mathieu born France which department', 'Andr√© Mathieu biography birth location French department', and cross-reference with French geographical administrative divisions to identify the specific department name.

**Use Cases**:
- Music streaming platforms enriching artist profiles by automating verification of birthplace, birth date, and nationality to ensure accurate metadata for curated playlists
- Academic publishing workflows automating fact-checking of composer biographies prior to journal release, guaranteeing historical accuracy in musicology research
- Museum digital archives validating exhibit labels and catalog entries by cross-referencing authoritative sources on artist life events and biographical details
- Genealogy services auditing user-submitted family trees by cross-checking ancestor birthplaces and vital records across multiple reputable databases
- Educational textbook publishers integrating an automated biographical verification pipeline to correct erroneous birthplace assumptions before printing
- Cultural grant administration automating due diligence on applicants‚Äô nationality and birthplace to confirm funding eligibility for heritage and arts programs
- Digital library metadata curation standardizing composer biographies across collections by generating comprehensive documentation and source citations
- Newsroom fact-checking teams employing a structured research and documentation script to validate biographical claims in articles about historical figures

The search successfully discovered that Dennis Flemion was born on June 6, 1955, providing the full day/month/year format that was requested. Multiple authoritative sources consistently confirm this date, including Wikipedia, NNDB, MusicBrainz, and other biographical databases. The code found 'June 6, 1955' referenced across numerous high-quality sources, with some showing the date in ISO format (1955-06-06). However, the output was cut off during the final search execution, suggesting the process may have been interrupted.

    "description": "This code provides the final analysis and confirmation of Dennis Flemion's complete birth date research. It inspects the workspace files to understand the search results structure, analyzes the birth date candidates found in previous searches, and confirms the complete birth date as June 6, 1955. The code validates this information against multiple authoritative sources (Wikipedia, NNDB, MusicBrainz, etc.) and creates comprehensive documentation files. Based on the tester's feedback that the search successfully found the complete birth date, this code formalizes the findings and provides the final answer: Dennis Flemion was born on June 6, 1955, fulfilling the PLAN's objective to find the specific day and month beyond just the 1955 birth year. The code saves both a detailed text report and a structured JSON summary to the workspace directory for future reference.",
