# Developer Plan #3 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** dc28cf18-6431-458b-83ef-64b3ce566c10  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 3  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 04:43:44

## Plan Content
```
Enumerate each attendee described in the narrative, assign a category of adult, kid who eats carbs, or kid who does not eat carbs, and calculate the total counts for adults and kids who will eat mashed potatoes.
```

## Plan Description
```
The previous developer calculation used incorrect attendee counts. This enumeration will produce accurate counts of adults and children who will consume mashed potatoes, which is essential for computing the correct total number of potatoes and determining how many 5-lb bags are needed.
```
