## Plan Content
```
Systematically analyze the family reunion attendee list to determine the exact number of adults and children attending. Parse through each family group mentioned: (1) Your parents (married mother and father), (2) Your twin brother and his family (brother + spouse + 2 children), (3) Your aunt and her family (aunt + spouse + 1 six-year-old), (4) Your grandma and her brother, (5) Her brother's daughter and her family (daughter + spouse + 3 kids under 12), plus yourself. Account for the deceased members (grandpa and grandma's sister-in-law) and the special dietary restriction (second cousins don't eat carbs). Calculate total potato consumption using the given rates: 1.5 potatoes per adult, 0.5 potatoes per child (except carb-free second cousins), convert to pounds using 0.5 pounds per potato, and determine how many 5-pound bags are needed.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) The task requires careful parsing of complex family relationships and attendance details, (2) No previous analysis exists in the history, (3) Expected outcome is to systematically count attendees and calculate potato requirements, (4) This directly addresses the core requirement to determine the number of potato bags needed for the family reunion

    "description": "This implementation systematically analyzes the family reunion scenario by breaking down each family group mentioned in the PLAN. I start by carefully parsing through each family unit: (1) parents (2 adults), (2) twin brother's family (2 adults + 2 children), (3) aunt's family (2 adults + 1 child), (4) grandma and her brother (2 adults), (5) second cousin's family (2 adults + 3 carb-free children), plus yourself (1 adult). The code tracks special dietary restrictions, noting that the 3 second cousins don't eat carbs, so they consume 0 potatoes. I calculate potato needs using the specified rates (1.5 per adult, 0.5 per child), convert to pounds (0.5 lbs per potato), and determine the number of 5-pound bags needed. The analysis includes comprehensive print statements for easy verification by the tester, saves detailed results to workspace/family_reunion_analysis.json, and creates a readable summary. This addresses the PLAN's requirement to systematically count attendees and calculate potato requirements while accounting for special dietary restrictions and deceased members who don't attend.",
