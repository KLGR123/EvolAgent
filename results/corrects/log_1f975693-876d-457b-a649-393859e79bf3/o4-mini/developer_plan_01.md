# Developer Plan #1 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 15:34:26

## Plan Content
```
Transcribe the audio recording at data/gaia/2023/validation/1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3.mp3 into a text transcript saved as workspace/homework_transcript.txt
```

## Plan Description
```
This plan is optimal because the task requires extracting specific page numbers mentioned by Professor Willowbrook from the audio recording, and transcription of the recording is the necessary first step to convert the spoken content into text for analysis of the required page numbers.

All intermediate steps and results are printed for tester visibility. The final transcript is saved in workspace/homework_transcript.txt.",
