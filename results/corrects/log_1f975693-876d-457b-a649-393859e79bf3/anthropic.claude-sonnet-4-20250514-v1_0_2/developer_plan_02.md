# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 1f975693-876d-457b-a649-393859e79bf3  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 15:41:39

## Plan Content
```
Extract and format the page numbers from the completed audio analysis into the final comma-delimited list in ascending order as requested. Based on the developer's results showing the corrected page list [132, 133, 134, 197, 245, 1197], format this into the exact output format specified in the TASK: a comma-delimited list of page numbers in ascending order for the Calculus mid-term study preparation.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary final step because: (1) The audio analysis has been completed and all page numbers have been successfully extracted from Professor Willowbrook's recording, (2) The developer identified 6 pages total: [132, 133, 134, 197, 245, 1197], (3) The TASK specifically requests the page numbers formatted as a comma-delimited list in ascending order, (4) This formatting step will provide the exact answer format needed for the student's study preparation

The script successfully formatted the corrected page numbers [132, 133, 134, 197, 245, 1197] into the exact comma-delimited format requested: '132, 133, 134, 197, 245, 1197'. The output verified the numbers were already in ascending order, performed proper formatting, and clearly displayed the final result. The code also saved the results to 'workspace/final_page_list.txt' for reference. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the final comma-delimited list in ascending order has been successfully generated for the Calculus mid-term study preparation.
