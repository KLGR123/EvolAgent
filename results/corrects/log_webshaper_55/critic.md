## Final Answer
```
Sereno Elisha Payne
```

## True Answer
```
New York Congressman Sereno E. Payne
```

## Reasoning
```
Task decomposition: This complex historical research question requires identifying the Congressional sponsor of December 1897 pension legislation that benefited a specific recipient who established a 1903 institution in Auburn, NY, with multiple denominational and Underground Railroad connections. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 initially identified Representative Charles Henry Grosvenor (R-OH) but later switched focus to Auburn Methodist Episcopal Church South Mission, showing inconsistent analysis and geographic confusion (Auburn, Alabama vs Auburn, NY). Member 2 correctly identified Auburn, NY as the prison system location and Sereno Elisha Payne as the bill sponsor, with solid research on Auburn High School as the 1903 institution and proper AME denominational connections. Member 3 provided the most comprehensive and accurate analysis, definitively identifying H.R. 4982 as the December 1897 bill, Sereno Elisha Payne as the introducer, and Harriet Tubman as the recipient who established the Harriet Tubman Home for Aged and Indigent Colored People in 1903 in Auburn, NY, with verified AME Zion Church property deeding. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on Payne as the bill sponsor between Members 2 and 3, while Member 1's Grosvenor identification lacks supporting evidence. Divergence resolution: Member 3's identification of Harriet Tubman as the specific pension recipient provides the most complete and historically accurate connection to all task requirements. Synthesis validation: Historical records confirm Payne (R-NY) introduced H.R. 4982 in December 1897 granting Tubman $25 monthly pension, Tubman established her Home in Auburn, NY in 1903, deeded property to AME Zion Church (Freedmen's Bureau collaborator), connecting to 1836 Ithaca AME congregation that served as Underground Railroad stop. Final answer confidence: high, based on documented Congressional records and verified historical connections.
