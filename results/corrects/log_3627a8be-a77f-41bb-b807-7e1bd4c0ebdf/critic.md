## Final Answer
```
142
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the British Museum object 2012,5015.17 (a mollusk shell), then find the 2021 Science Advances article about beads made from this species to determine their minimum age in thousands of years. Member evaluation: Member 1 identified the object as Nassa gibbosula and found a 2021 Science Advances article claiming beads are 150 thousand years old, but their research appears to conflate different articles and species without proper verification. Member 2 also identified the object as Nassa gibbosula and found the correct 2021 Science Advances article 'Early Middle Stone Age personal ornaments from Bizmoune Cave' with beads ≥142,000 years old, demonstrating more precise research methodology. Member 3 acknowledged inability to access the British Museum object details but conducted the most systematic search for 2021 Science Advances articles, identifying the same primary article as Member 2 with beads ≥142 thousand years old and providing comprehensive documentation of methodology. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on 142 thousand years between Members 2 and 3, both citing the same authoritative source (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abi8620). Member 1's claim of 150 thousand years appears to be from a different or incorrectly cited source. The ≥142,000 years figure represents the minimum age ('at least') as specifically requested in the task. Integration assessment: Members 2 and 3 provide consistent, well-documented evidence from the same peer-reviewed source, while Member 1's methodology shows less rigor in source verification. Final validation confirms 142 as the correct answer based on the authoritative 2021 Science Advances publication.
