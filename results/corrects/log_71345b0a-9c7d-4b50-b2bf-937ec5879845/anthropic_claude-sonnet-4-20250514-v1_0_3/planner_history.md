    "plan": "Search for leap days that occurred before 2008 and identify the specific dates (February 29th in leap years: 2004, 2000, 1996, 1992, etc.). Then access the Wikipedia revision history for the 'Dragon' page to examine edits made on those leap days, focusing on content removals that appear to be jokes or humorous additions. Extract the specific phrase that was removed from the page during one of these leap day edits.",
    "description": "This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific leap day before 2008 when a joke was removed from the Dragon Wikipedia page, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the relevant leap day edit in Wikipedia's revision history and identify the removed joke phrase, (4) This directly targets the specific edit event described in the TASK by focusing on leap days (February 29th) in years 2004, 2000, 1996, etc.",

    "description": "The PLAN has been successfully completed! Through systematic investigation, we have definitively identified that the humorous phrase removed from the Dragon Wikipedia page on February 29, 2004 was 'Here be dragons:'. The investigation process was thorough and successful: (1) We identified February 29, 2004 as the relevant leap day before 2008, (2) Retrieved historical Dragon Wikipedia revisions from 2004 using modified MediaWiki API queries, (3) Located revision 2580816 by user Timwi with the telling comment 'I admit, I did laugh. :-)', (4) Retrieved the actual content of both the leap day revision and the previous revision for comparison, (5) Performed detailed content analysis that revealed 'Here be dragons:' was among the content removed. This phrase is humorous because it's a medieval cartographic reference ('Here be dragons') placed on a disambiguation page about dragons, creating an amusing circular reference. All analysis data has been preserved in comprehensive JSON files in the workspace. The leap day Dragon humor mystery has been definitively solved with 100% PLAN completion.",

Through systematic investigation of Wikipedia revision history, the developer located revision 2580816 by user Timwi with the comment 'I admit, I did laugh. :-)', and determined that the humorous phrase removed was 'Here be dragons:' - a medieval cartographic reference that created an amusing circular reference when placed on a disambiguation page about dragons. Final answer (without punctuation): Here be dragons",
