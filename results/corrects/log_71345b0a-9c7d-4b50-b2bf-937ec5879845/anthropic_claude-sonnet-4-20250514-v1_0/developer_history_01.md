    "description": "This implementation extracts Wikipedia revision history for the 'Dragon' page from 1999-2008 and filters for edits made on leap days (February 29, 2000 and February 29, 2004). The code: (1) Uses Wikipedia API to fetch comprehensive revision data with timestamps, users, comments, and revision IDs, (2) Filters specifically for the two target leap days before 2008, (3) Analyzes edit comments for keywords related to joke/humor removal ('joke', 'humor', 'remove', 'delete', etc.), (4) Saves raw revision data and filtered results to workspace files, (5) Creates a detailed summary report of findings. The approach is systematic and will identify any content changes made on those specific dates, particularly focusing on humor or joke removal as specified in the plan. If leap day revisions are found, the next step would be to examine the actual content differences using the revision IDs.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and successfully extracted Wikipedia Dragon page revision history from 1999-2008. The script made 8 API requests and retrieved 3,966 total revisions, finding 1 revision made on a leap day (February 29, 2004). However, the found revision has comment 'I admit, I did laugh. :-)' which suggests content was ADDED rather than removed, and doesn't contain obvious joke/humor removal keywords. The code properly saved all data to workspace files (raw data: 917KB, leap day data, and summary report). **PLAN** alignment: 80% complete - successfully found leap day revisions but the discovered revision appears to be adding humorous content rather than removing it as specified in the **PLAN**. Next steps: (1) Examine the actual content changes of revision ID 2580816 to determine what was modified, (2) Check the parent revision to see what content changed, (3) Consider that this revision might be responding to joke removal by adding content back, requiring analysis of surrounding revisions to find the original removal.",

The code: (1) Inspects the saved leap day revision data structure before processing, (2) Uses Wikipedia API to fetch full content for both the target revision (2580816) and its parent revision for comparison, (3) Analyzes the specific content differences to determine if content was added, removed, or modified, (4) Searches for humor/joke-related keywords in the changed content, (5) Examines revisions within 7 days of the leap day to provide context for joke-related activity, (6) Saves comprehensive analysis results to workspace files. This approach will reveal whether the 'I admit, I did laugh. :-)' comment indicates joke removal or addition, and may uncover related joke removal in nearby revisions that this comment was responding to.",

The analysis revealed that revision 2580816 REMOVED 217 characters of content, transforming the page from a longer format to a cleaner disambiguation page structure. Specifically, content was removed including 'Here be dragons:' and other text, while adding proper disambiguation formatting. However, no obvious humor-related keywords were found in the content changes themselves. The analysis examined surrounding revisions within 7 days and saved detailed results to workspace files (leap_day_content_analysis.json and leap_day_nearby_revisions.json). **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - successfully identified and analyzed the actual content changes on the leap day, though the removed content doesn't contain explicit joke/humor keywords. The comment 'I admit, I did laugh. :-)' suggests the user was responding to humorous content, but the specific joke content may have been removed in a previous revision. The analysis provides the foundation needed to understand what content changes occurred on this leap day, fulfilling the core **PLAN** objective of examining leap day edits for content removal.",
