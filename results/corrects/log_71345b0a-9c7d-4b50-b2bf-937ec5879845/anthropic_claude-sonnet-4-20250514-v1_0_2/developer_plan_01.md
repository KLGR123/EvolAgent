# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for the Wikipedia page revision history for the 'Dragon' article to identify leap day edits that occurred before 2008. Focus on February 29th dates in 2004 and 2000 (the leap days before 2008). Look for edit summaries or revision differences that mention joke removal, humor deletion, or similar content changes. Extract the specific revision data showing what phrase or content was removed from the Dragon Wikipedia page on those leap day dates.

## Description
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific leap day before 2008 when a joke was removed from the Dragon Wikipedia page, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate Wikipedia revision history showing leap day edits (February 29, 2004 or February 29, 2000) with joke removal, (4) This establishes the foundation for finding the exact phrase that was deleted from the Dragon page on that leap day.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 40: Extract common disparaging word from dragon portrayal quotes in Emily Midkiff’s June 2014 Fafnir article

**Description**: Access Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the Fafnir journal to extract the full text and identify the specific word that was quoted from two different authors expressing distaste for the nature of dragon depictions. Parse the article content systematically to locate quotes from multiple authors that contain the same critical word about dragon portrayals.

**Use Cases**:
- Literary criticism archiving: Automatically extract and collate critical adjectives from fantasy journals to build a reference of scholarly sentiment on dragon characters for an author writing a meta-analysis
- Higher education course preparation: Pull out recurring critical terms from Midkiff’s Fafnir article to create lecture slides on contemporary scholarly critiques of mythic creatures
- Digital humanities project: Process a corpus of mythology journals to identify and compare key negative descriptors of dragons across different time periods
- Publishing industry fact-checking: Scan submitted dragon-focused manuscripts to ensure authors accurately reference and quote established criticism from academic sources
- AI-driven content moderation: Train a model to detect and flag overly critical or negative language in user-generated fantasy lore based on extracted keywords from scholarly texts
- Museum exhibit curation: Extract and summarize critical terms from historical and modern scholarship to craft exhibit labels that challenge or reinforce public perceptions of dragons
- Online encyclopedia updating: Automatically detect and update entries with historically significant critical quotes about dragons to maintain scholarly accuracy in mythological articles

### Development Step 4: Extract July 3 2023 LOTR Wikipedia Internal Links Toward A Song of Ice and Fire

**Description**: Access the archived Wikipedia page for 'The Lord of the Rings' (book) as it appeared at the end of July 3, 2023. Use the Wayback Machine or Wikipedia's revision history to retrieve the specific version from that date. Extract all outbound links from the page content, focusing on internal Wikipedia links that could potentially lead toward 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. Create a comprehensive list of linked pages including literature, fantasy, author, publisher, and genre-related links that might serve as stepping stones in the path-finding process.

**Use Cases**:
- Competitive product mapping for market intelligence teams: archive the Wikipedia page of a rival’s flagship product, extract outbound links, and use BFS to uncover related technologies and collaborators leading to a specific emerging competitor.
- Academic literature exploration for research librarians: retrieve an archived revision of a foundational theory page, scrape internal links, and trace a path through related journals and authors to locate a target contemporary study.
- SEO internal linking audit for digital marketing agencies: load a historical snapshot of a high-traffic Wikipedia article, extract its link network, and identify the shortest chain of links that leads to pages optimized for a target keyword.
- Educational curriculum design for e-learning platforms: access the archived “Introduction to Biology” page, gather its outbound topic links, and map a learning path toward advanced genetics content using breadth-first search.
- Historical content evolution analysis for digital archivists: pull the July 2023 version of a political event page, extract links, and reconstruct how references to a specific legislation article appeared over time by finding link paths.
- Knowledge graph augmentation for AI research teams: scrape a past revision of an ontology page, collect entity links, and build a linkage chain to a new domain-specific concept to enrich the graph with contextual relationships.
- Due diligence support for consulting firms: obtain an archived corporate biography page, scrape its network of partner and subsidiary links, and run BFS to identify the shortest route to a target industry regulation page.

### Development Step 9: Filter Wikipedia Revisions from Inception to June 30, 2023, and Count All Edits

**Description**: Filter the extracted revision data from the comprehensive Wikipedia history to count only the edits made from the page's inception until the end of June 2023. Exclude any revisions that occurred after June 30, 2023, and provide the exact count of edits within the specified timeframe.

**Use Cases**:
- Historical audit of a high-traffic political article to report the exact number of edits from its creation through June 30, 2023 for a government transparency review
- Legal compliance verification of a corporate product documentation page by counting all edits made before the July 2023 launch cutoff
- Academic analysis of contributor activity on the “Climate Change” Wikipedia entry up to June 30, 2023 to correlate edit bursts with major IPCC report releases
- Data journalism investigation tracking the volume of corrections on COVID-19–related pages from inception until mid-2023 to illustrate information stability
- Software documentation freeze monitoring by tallying updates to the “Docker” page before the June 2023 feature-freeze deadline for release planning
- Competitive market research quantifying revision counts on flagship smartphone pages through June 2023 to benchmark public interest trends
- Non-profit grant application support by auditing edits made to the NGO’s mission statement article up to June 2023 funding deadline

### Development Step 8: Extract July 3 2023 LOTR Wikipedia Outbound Links Toward A Song of Ice and Fire

**Description**: Access the archived Wikipedia page for 'The Lord of the Rings' (book) as it appeared at the end of July 3, 2023. Use the Wayback Machine or Wikipedia's revision history to retrieve the specific version from that date. Extract all outbound links from the page content, focusing on internal Wikipedia links that could potentially lead toward 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. Create a comprehensive list of linked pages including literature, fantasy, author, publisher, and genre-related links that might serve as stepping stones in the path-finding process.

**Use Cases**:
- Digital humanities research: mapping interlinking between fantasy literature pages on Wikipedia to analyze the thematic evolution from “The Lord of the Rings” to “A Song of Ice and Fire”
- Fan community website automation: extracting and categorizing internal links from the July 3, 2023 LOTR archive to automatically update character, location, and lore indexes
- Publishing market intelligence: analyzing Tolkien‐related outbound links and award categories to identify emerging authors and genre trends for editorial acquisition strategies
- Educational content auditing: retrieving archived Wikipedia snapshots and extracting author and genre links to ensure digital course materials cover all relevant literary themes
- Recommendation engine enhancement: using categorized fantasy and literature links to build graph-based book suggestions connecting Tolkien’s works to George R.R. Martin in a subscription reading platform
- Library digital archives quality control: monitoring Wikipedia revision history and link extraction to validate and enrich metadata for epic fantasy holdings
- SEO optimization for a literature blog: auditing outbound Wikipedia links from archived articles to update affiliate and resource pages with accurate genre and author cross‐references
- Wikipedia editorial QA: extracting archived link structures to detect missing or broken internal references and automate edit suggestions for epic fantasy articles
