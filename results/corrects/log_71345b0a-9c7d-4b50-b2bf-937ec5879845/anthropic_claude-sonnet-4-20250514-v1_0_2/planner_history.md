    "plan": "Search for the Wikipedia page revision history for the 'Dragon' article to identify leap day edits that occurred before 2008. Focus on February 29th dates in 2004 and 2000 (the leap days before 2008). Look for edit summaries or revision differences that mention joke removal, humor deletion, or similar content changes. Extract the specific revision data showing what phrase or content was removed from the Dragon Wikipedia page on those leap day dates.",
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific leap day before 2008 when a joke was removed from the Dragon Wikipedia page, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate Wikipedia revision history showing leap day edits (February 29, 2004 or February 29, 2000) with joke removal, (4) This establishes the foundation for finding the exact phrase that was deleted from the Dragon page on that leap day.',

    "description": "The PLAN objective has been 100% completed successfully. Through comprehensive analysis of Dragon Wikipedia revision history from 2000-2007, I successfully identified the specific humorous phrase that was removed on leap day (February 29, 2004) before 2008. \n\nKey findings accomplished:\n1. **Target Edit Located**: Found exactly one leap day edit on Feb 29, 2004 by user 'Timwi' with revision ID 2580816\n2. **User Comment Confirmed Humor**: Edit comment was 'I admit, I did laugh. :-)' - explicitly confirming the humorous nature of removed content\n3. **Specific Phrase Identified**: The humorous phrase removed was 'Here be dragons:' \n4. **Context Explained**: This created a meta-joke by using the traditional cartographic warning phrase 'Here be dragons' (meaning dangerous/unknown territory) as a header on a Wikipedia page actually ABOUT dragons\n5. **Complete Documentation**: Generated comprehensive analysis with 9 workspace files totaling over 930KB of supporting data\n\n**Final Answer**: The specific phrase removed from the Dragon Wikipedia page on leap day February 29, 2004 was 'Here be dragons:' - a humorous meta-reference that amused user Timwi enough to comment about laughing before removing it as part of page standardization efforts.\n\nAll objectives from the PLAN have been achieved with full verification through direct Wikipedia API content comparison, detailed revision analysis, and comprehensive documentation. The mystery of the Dragon Wikipedia leap day joke removal has been completely solved.",
