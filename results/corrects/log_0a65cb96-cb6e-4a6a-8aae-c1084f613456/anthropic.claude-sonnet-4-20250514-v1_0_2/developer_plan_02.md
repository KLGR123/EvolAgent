## Plan Content
```
Research the namesake of Marquette, Michigan to identify the historical figure the city was named after. Then search for landmark buildings in Chicago named after this same person. Focus on finding: (1) The historical namesake of Marquette, Michigan (likely Jacques Marquette, the French missionary and explorer), (2) Buildings or structures in Chicago named after this person, (3) The specific landmark building and its architectural details. Extract information about when the building was constructed, its significance, and most importantly, which architectural firm designed it.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the logical next step because: (1) The previous research successfully identified Marquette, Michigan as the city whose lights appeared in the NASA APOD, (2) We now need to trace the city's namesake to find the corresponding Chicago landmark, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the historical figure (likely Jacques Marquette) and locate the Chicago building named after him, (4) This advances us toward finding the architectural firm that designed the landmark building

This initial phase focuses on: (1) Confirming that Marquette, Michigan was named after Jacques Marquette, the French Jesuit missionary and explorer (1637-1675), (2) Conducting comprehensive searches for Chicago buildings named after Jacques Marquette, (3) Gathering initial search results and building references from multiple sources. The code uses Google Search API to find relevant information and saves initial findings to workspace/marquette_research_initial.json for structured analysis. This establishes the foundation for detailed architectural research in the next development phase.',

The script successfully identified Jacques Marquette as the namesake of Marquette, Michigan and found multiple search results about the Marquette Building in Chicago. Key findings include: (1) Confirmed Jacques Marquette (1637-1675) as the historical figure, (2) Located the landmark Marquette Building in Chicago completed in 1894-1895, (3) Found a crucial clue - Result 6 mentions 'Holabird & Roche (American architectural firm, established 1883)' as the architectural firm. The research data was properly saved to workspace. **PLAN** alignment: 70% complete - the namesake and Chicago building are identified, but detailed architectural information still needs to be extracted.
