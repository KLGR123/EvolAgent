## Final Answer
```
Holabird
```

## Reasoning
```
Task decomposition: Identify a city with lights on horizon in NASA APOD first week Aug 2015, find Chicago landmark named after city's namesake, determine architectural firm that designed it, extract first name in firm's designation as of June 2023. Member 1 correctly identified Marquette, MI from Aug 3, 2015 APOD and the Marquette Building in Chicago designed by Holabird & Roche (now Holabird & Root). Member 2 reached identical conclusions. Member 3 followed similar approach but incorrectly concluded 'William' as the answer, confusing the founder's first name with the first name appearing in the firm designation. Cross-analysis shows strong convergence on Marquette Building and Holabird & Roche/Root identification. Divergence occurs only in final interpretation - Members 1 and 2 correctly identify 'Holabird' as first name in firm designation, while Member 3 incorrectly extracts 'William'. Final verification confirms firm name is 'Holabird & Root' as of June 2023, with 'Holabird' being the first name in the firm designation. The task specifically requests the first name appearing in the firm's name (not the founder's first name). Therefore, 'Holabird' is the correct answer.
