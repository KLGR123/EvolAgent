# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search arXiv.org for AI regulation papers originally submitted in June 2022. Focus on identifying papers that discuss artificial intelligence regulation, policy, governance, or related topics. Look for papers with submission dates in June 2022 and examine their content to find one containing a figure with three axes where each axis has label words at both ends. Extract the specific words used as axis labels in this figure.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to identify the specific AI regulation paper from June 2022 that contains the three-axis figure before we can find the axis label words, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the relevant paper and extract the figure with its axis labels, (4) This establishes the foundation for the second part of the task - finding which of these words appears in a Physics and Society article from August 11, 2016

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 1: Determine number of Transformer encoder layers in “Attention Is All You Need” paper

**Description**: Search for the original 'Attention is All You Need' paper to identify the number of encoder layers in the Transformer architecture. Use these search approaches: (1) Search for the paper title 'Attention is All You Need' on Google Scholar or arXiv, (2) Look for the official paper PDF which should be available on arXiv, (3) Extract the architecture details specifically focusing on the encoder structure and number of layers/blocks mentioned in the model description.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic research automation for meta-analyses: programmatically retrieve the original “Attention is All You Need” paper to extract encoder layer counts and integrate them into systematic literature reviews.
- ML engineering validation pipeline: automatically fetch and verify Transformer encoder configurations from arXiv before deploying new model variants in production.
- AI startup documentation generator: scrape authoritative Transformer architecture details (e.g., number of encoder layers) to auto-populate design docs and architecture diagrams.
- University library metadata enrichment: catalog and tag neural network publications by extracting specific model specs (encoder blocks) from arXiv PDFs for an academic repository.
- Curriculum development for AI courses: pull the official paper PDF and parse out the encoder layer information to generate accurate lecture slides and course materials.
- Compliance auditing in AI ethics review: cross-reference published Transformer architectures by automatically fetching encoder layer details to ensure transparency in white papers and regulatory filings.
- Competitive intelligence dashboard: aggregate specifications of foundational models by programmatically searching for “Attention is All You Need” on Google Scholar and arXiv to compare encoder depths across implementations.

### Development Step 3: Find Number of Encoder Layers in Transformer from ‘Attention is All You Need’ Paper

**Description**: Search for the original 'Attention is All You Need' paper to identify the number of encoder layers in the Transformer architecture. Use these search approaches: (1) Search for the paper title 'Attention is All You Need' on Google Scholar or arXiv, (2) Look for the official paper PDF which should be available on arXiv, (3) Extract the architecture details specifically focusing on the encoder structure and number of layers/blocks mentioned in the model description.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated extraction of encoder/decoder layer counts from NLP research papers to speed up AI architecture comparisons
- Patent due diligence for tech startups: scanning patent PDFs to pull out the number of claims, layers, or modules for portfolio analysis
- Clinical trial document analysis: extracting patient sample sizes and trial phase counts from medical study PDFs for regulatory reporting
- Financial compliance monitoring: scanning annual reports (10-K/20-F) to identify and extract specific risk disclosure sections with keyword and numeric patterns
- Legal contract review automation: pulling out clause numbers, renewal terms, and penalty figures from lengthy contract PDFs to populate a legal database
- Academic meta-analysis support: summarizing methodology details (e.g., number of participants, experimental groups) across dozens of research articles
- Product whitepaper feature auditing: extracting technical specification counts (e.g., sensor layers, processing modules) from IoT hardware whitepapers to inform R&D decisions
- Educational content indexing: analyzing textbook or lecture PDF files to automatically list chapter and section counts for curriculum management
