**Task ID:** webshaper_30  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-07 08:53:21

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about the co-creators of Yahoo! and identify which one appeared in a documentary directed by Ondi Timoner that profiled Josh Harris and won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Focus on finding: (1) The names of Yahoo!'s co-founders, (2) Details about Ondi Timoner's documentary about Josh Harris that won at Sundance, (3) Which Yahoo! co-founder appeared in this documentary and reflected on their journey in connection with it.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify Yahoo!'s co-creators first, then trace which one appeared in the specific documentary, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find both Yahoo!'s founding details and the documentary information to establish the connection, (4) This directly targets the intersection of Yahoo!'s creation story and the documentary appearance that will lead us to the specific co-creator mentioned in the TASK

### Development Step 2: Identify Year David Sklar Introduced Innovation Reports Section in Academic Medicine Journal

**Description**: Search for information about David Sklar and Innovation Reports in Academic Medicine journal. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Direct search for 'David Sklar Innovation Reports Academic Medicine journal', (2) Search Academic Medicine journal archives or database for articles by David Sklar, (3) Search for 'Innovation Reports Academic Medicine introduction year', (4) Look for historical information about when Innovation Reports section was established in Academic Medicine. Focus on identifying the specific year when David Sklar introduced or established the Innovation Reports feature in this medical journal.

**Use Cases**:
- Competitive intelligence for product teams: parse search engine results and press release archives to pinpoint the exact year a rival company introduced a flagship feature, enabling data-driven roadmap planning.
- Academic editorial research: mine online journal archives and search metadata to determine when a specific section (e.g., “Case Studies”) was first established and credit the founding editor with publication details.
- Legal compliance tracking: analyze government websites and legal databases to extract the enactment year of a new regulation by detecting keywords like “enacted” or “established” in legal snippets.
- Patent analytics for R&D: aggregate patent office search results and automatically extract filing and grant years for key inventions in a target technology domain, ranking them by relevance.
- Marketing campaign monitoring: search news aggregators and corporate blogs to identify the introduction date of a major brand slogan or sustainability initiative, capturing launch year and source URLs.
- Public policy timeline building: scrape WHO, CDC, and other public health agency archives to confirm the publication year of critical guidelines, filtering for “published” or “launched” mentions in the text.
- Technical standards research: gather search results from ISO, IEEE, and industry consortium websites to establish when a new communication protocol or best practice standard was first released.
- Corporate heritage documentation: compile internal communications, annual reports, and press coverage to verify the inception year of a company’s flagship community outreach program, extracting evidence and timestamps.

The output discusses 'Asolo Repertory Theatre', 'theater company candidates', and 'Sarasota theater operations' which are entirely unrelated to Yahoo, Jerry Yang, David Filo, or the Josh Harris documentary. This appears to be output from a different script or cached results from a previous task. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no Yahoo or documentary-related information was found. The code structure looks correct for the intended search, but the execution results don't match.

First, it inspects the workspace directory to understand what files exist and checks if the expected search results file contains Yahoo/documentary data or unrelated theater information. Then it re-executes the Yahoo co-founders and Ondi Timoner documentary searches with proper error handling, timeout settings, and detailed logging to ensure the correct searches are performed. The code includes verification steps to confirm API connectivity, response validation, and result inspection to prevent the previous issue where theater-related results appeared instead of Yahoo/documentary information. Results are saved to a new verified file for analysis in the next step.',

The SerpAPI account has exhausted its search quota, preventing any data collection. The code also found an existing search results file that contains empty data (only 2 bytes with empty JSON keys), confirming previous search attempts were unsuccessful. **PLAN** alignment: 0% - no search data was obtained due to API quota limitations. Since the search API is unavailable, the **PLAN** cannot be completed using this approach.

The approach includes: (1) Using Wikipedia API to get Yahoo summary information, (2) Scraping the full Yahoo Wikipedia page to extract founder details (Jerry Yang and David Filo), (3) Researching Ondi Timoner's Wikipedia page for documentary information, (4) Specifically investigating 'We Live in Public' documentary page for cast/participant details, and (5) Analyzing connections between Yahoo co-founders and the documentary. All findings are compiled and saved to workspace/yahoo_documentary_research_results.json for comprehensive analysis. This method provides a viable alternative when search APIs are unavailable.",

The script successfully identified Yahoo's co-founders (Jerry Yang and David Filo) and gathered information about Ondi Timoner's documentary 'We Live in Public' about Josh Harris. However, the output was truncated and appears incomplete - the research summary shows 'No direct connections found in initial research' but the full analysis may contain more information. **PLAN** alignment: 70% complete - successfully identified the co-founders and documentary details, but the connection between them needs to be fully established. The comprehensive research results were saved to 'workspace/yahoo_documentary_research_results.json'. Recommendation: Load and analyze the complete saved JSON file to examine all gathered information and determine if any connections between the Yahoo co-founders and the documentary were found in the detailed research data.",

It first inspects the workspace directory and safely examines the structure of the research results JSON file. Then it conducts a detailed analysis extracting: (1) Yahoo co-founders identification (Jerry Yang and David Filo), (2) Documentary information ('We Live in Public' by Ondi Timoner about Josh Harris), (3) Connection analysis between the founders and documentary, (4) Sundance Grand Jury Prize verification, and (5) Manual text analysis searching for any mentions of Yahoo founders in documentary contexts. The code provides a complete summary of findings and determines whether the connection between Yahoo co-founders and the documentary has been established or if additional research is needed.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - Code ran successfully and performed comprehensive analysis of the research data, correctly identifying Yahoo co-founders (Jerry Yang and David Filo) and confirming Ondi Timoner's documentary 'We Live in Public' about Josh Harris won the Sundance Grand Jury Prize. However, the execution failed with a NameError at line 231 due to an undefined variable 'text_lower' in the manual text analysis section. The code completed most of its analysis showing no direct connections were found between Yahoo co-founders and the documentary in the collected Wikipedia data. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - all key information was identified but the final connection analysis was interrupted by the coding error. The research data shows comprehensive information about both Yahoo's founders and the documentary, but no evidence of either Jerry Yang or David Filo appearing in 'We Live in Public'. Recommended fix: Correct the variable name error in the manual text analysis section and complete the final analysis to definitively conclude whether a connection exists or if additional research sources are needed.",

    "description": "This code provides a simplified, direct approach to complete the Yahoo co-founders documentary analysis without complex recursive functions that were causing errors. It safely loads and inspects the research data structure, then performs: (1) Direct extraction of confirmed facts about Yahoo co-founders (Jerry Yang, David Filo) and the documentary ('We Live in Public' by Ondi Timoner about Josh Harris), (2) Simple text search through all research data for founder mentions, (3) Context analysis to determine if founders are mentioned in documentary-related contexts, (4) Verification of Sundance Grand Jury Prize, and (5) Final definitive answer to the PLAN question. The approach uses basic string operations and JSON parsing to avoid function definition issues while still providing comprehensive analysis. Results are saved to workspace/yahoo_documentary_final_answer.json with the complete conclusion about whether either Yahoo co-founder appeared in the documentary.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - Code ran successfully through most of the analysis, correctly identifying Yahoo co-founders (Jerry Yang and David Filo) and confirming Ondi Timoner's documentary 'We Live in Public' about Josh Harris won the Grand Jury Prize at 2009 Sundance Film Festival. However, execution failed with NameError due to function definition issues in the text analysis section. The code has successfully established all core facts needed for the **PLAN** but encounters repeated coding errors when trying to complete the connection analysis. **PLAN** alignment: 90% complete - all essential information is confirmed (Yahoo co-founders identified, documentary details verified, Sundance award confirmed), and the research data shows 0 direct connections found in automated analysis. Based on the comprehensive Wikipedia research conducted, there appears to be no evidence of either Jerry Yang or David Filo appearing in 'We Live in Public'. Recommendation: Use a simplified approach without recursive functions to complete the final text analysis, or proceed with the conclusion based on the clear evidence already gathered - that no connections were found between Yahoo co-founders and the documentary in the extensive Wikipedia research performed.",

    "description": "This code provides the final, definitive analysis of the Yahoo co-founders and Ondi Timoner documentary connection using the simplest possible approach to avoid all previous coding errors. It safely loads the research data, directly extracts confirmed facts (Yahoo co-founders Jerry Yang and David Filo, documentary 'We Live in Public' by Ondi Timoner about Josh Harris winning Sundance Grand Jury Prize), performs straightforward text analysis using basic string operations to search for founder mentions in documentary contexts, and provides a clear final answer to the PLAN question. The approach uses only simple string methods and JSON operations to avoid function definition issues while still delivering comprehensive analysis. Based on the research showing 0 connections found in automated analysis and no documentary context mentions, the code concludes that neither Yahoo co-founder appeared in the documentary. Results are saved to workspace/yahoo_documentary_definitive_answer.json with the complete conclusion.",
