### City Where Homeless Shelter Conversion to Flats Was Approved in October 2019

**TASK**: "In October 2019, a developer received planning permission to convert a homeless shelter into flats in a city. This developer had developed a building located in an area along the Bournemouth Seafront, which includes the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum and the East Cliff Lift, contains historic villas from the 19th Century, and was designated as a conservation area in 1987. What is the name of this city?"

### First name of the firm that designed the Chicago landmark named for APOD horizon city namesake

**TASK**: During the first week of August 2015, one of the NASA Astronomy Pictures of the Day shows the lights of a city on the horizon.

Focus on finding cast and crew information, production details, or any available filmography records that might identify the composer. Try searching film databases, IMDb alternatives, or vintage movie resources using queries like 'Run Home Slow 1963 cast crew', 'Run Home Slow 1963 filmography', 'Run Home Slow movie soundtrack music composer', and check for any mentions in B-movie or exploitation film databases that might have more complete records of obscure films from this era.",
    "description": "This alternative approach is necessary because: (1) The previous comprehensive search failed to identify the 2020 documentary or its connection to 'Run Home Slow', (2) We need to work backwards by first establishing concrete information about the 1963 film itself to identify its composer, (3) Expected outcome is to find verified cast/crew information for 'Run Home Slow' that includes the composer's name, (4) Once we identify the composer, we can then search more effectively for 2020 documentaries featuring that specific person and their director",
