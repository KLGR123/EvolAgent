                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003<br><br>
                <strong>True Answer:</strong><br>
                The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task decomposition: This complex multi-layered question requires (1) identifying the Supreme Court nominee who replaced Scalia with specific confirmation criteria (first after nuclear option, 54-45 vote), (2) determining the Attorney General during that confirmation, and (3) researching that person's voting record on major tax cut acts during their Senate tenure. All three members demonstrated identical analytical approaches and reached unanimous conclusions across all components. Member evaluation: Member 1 showed systematic progression through each research phase with comprehensive documentation and high confidence assessments (95%+), including detailed timeline analysis and thorough verification of vote counts and dates. Member 2 employed parallel methodology with equally rigorous research standards, generating extensive documentation (8 files, 10,974 bytes) and achieving very high confidence through official Senate records verification. Member 3 utilized similar systematic approach with complete timeline reconstruction and comprehensive legislative analysis. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: All members correctly identified (1) Neil Gorsuch as Scalia's replacement confirmed 54-45 on April 7, 2017, after nuclear option invocation on April 6, 2017, (2) Jeff Sessions as Attorney General serving during this confirmation (confirmed February 9, 2017), and (3) Sessions' votes for the two major Bush-era tax cuts during his 1997-2017 Senate tenure. Synthesis evaluation: The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (H.R. 1836) and Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (H.R. 2) represent the definitive answer, supported by unanimous member agreement, comprehensive legislative research, and verified voting records. Final validation confirms these were the most significant comprehensive tax cut acts during Sessions' Senate career, with documented votes and substantial economic impacts ($1.35 trillion and $350 billion respectively).
