## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Determine population difference between largest and smallest Washington state county seats by land area using 2020 census data from data.census.gov. All three members successfully completed the multi-step research process: (1) compiled all 39 Washington state county seats, (2) collected land area data, (3) identified extremes by land area, and (4) obtained 2020 census population data. Critical divergence identified in smallest county seat determination: Members 1 and 2 correctly identified Cathlamet (0.51 sq mi and 0.4 sq mi respectively) as smallest, while Member 3 incorrectly identified Asotin (1.02 sq mi). Cross-validation reveals Members 1 and 2 used more comprehensive land area datasets achieving higher coverage rates, while Member 3's dataset appears incomplete. All members correctly identified Seattle as largest county seat (land areas: 142.07, 83.9, and 142.07 sq mi respectively - variations likely due to different measurement methodologies but consistent identification). Population data convergence: All members obtained identical figures from official census API - Seattle: 737,015, and for the correctly identified smallest city Cathlamet: 560. Member 3's Asotin population (1,204) is irrelevant due to incorrect city identification. Methodological assessment: Members 1 and 2 demonstrated superior data collection rigor with 100% county coverage and proper identification of extremes. Final calculation verification: 737,015 - 560 = 736,455. Confidence level: high, supported by convergent results from two independent comprehensive analyses.
