**Task ID:** webshaper_49  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-10 17:21:43

## Plan Content
```
Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the book 'Sacred Desire' and its protagonist, focusing on finding information about a former Soviet paratrooper who co-founded an organization and fled due to a 1992 crackdown. Search for keywords including 'Sacred Desire book protagonist Soviet paratrooper', 'Sacred Desire novel former Soviet paratrooper co-founder', '1992 crackdown organization Soviet paratrooper fled', and 'Sacred Desire character co-founded organization 1992'. Extract details about the protagonist's identity, the organization they co-founded, and the circumstances of the 1992 crackdown.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific book 'Sacred Desire' and its protagonist who is described as a former Soviet paratrooper, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to determine the protagonist's identity and the organization they co-founded that faced a 1992 crackdown, (4) This establishes the foundation needed to then identify who led the group that conducted the crackdown against this organization

### Development Step 1: Identify Developer of Tradition-Based Narrative Ethics in “Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics”

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the developer of tradition-based narrative ethics whose theories are applied in 'Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics' which analyzes business ethics case studies. Search for keywords including 'tradition-based narrative ethics', 'Studies in War Business Environmental Ethics', 'narrative ethics theory', and 'business ethics case studies'. Focus on identifying the primary philosopher or ethicist who developed this theoretical framework and is referenced in academic literature on business ethics.

**Use Cases**:
- Business ethics consulting and framework development by automating searches for the primary developer of tradition-based narrative ethics to support corporate governance case studies
- PhD-level literature review automation for identifying key works and authors behind tradition-based narrative ethics in dissertations on business ethics
- Corporate compliance training content curation by gathering authoritative sources on narrative ethics theory for environmental and war-related ethics modules
- Environmental policy briefing research by pinpointing the main ethicist of tradition-based narrative ethics to bolster NGO whitepapers on sustainable business practice
- University library catalogue enrichment through automated indexing of publications by the originator of tradition-based narrative ethics for faculty resource lists
- Academic publisher fact-checking workflows that verify theoretical attributions in manuscripts on war, business, and environmental ethics
- Think tank knowledge management for peace and conflict studies by tracking citations of tradition-based narrative ethics in policy research on corporate cooperation
- Ethics research platform development integrating semantic search feeds of foundational texts by the narrative ethics philosopher for advanced user queries

### Development Step 2: Identify the 1997 economic crisis prompting China’s 287 billion yuan infrastructure stimulus

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the significant economic event that China faced in 1997, specifically focusing on the context surrounding China's allocation of 287 billion yuan for major construction projects during that year. Search for keywords including 'China 1997 economic crisis', 'Asian Financial Crisis 1997 China', 'China 287 billion yuan construction projects 1997', '1997 China economic stimulus', and 'China infrastructure investment 1997'. Focus on identifying the specific economic event or crisis that prompted this substantial government investment in construction and infrastructure projects.

**Use Cases**:
- Competitive market analysis for a retail chain, using automated web search result parsing to identify when and why a rival launched a major price-cutting campaign
- Investment risk assessment for a hedge fund, extracting and scoring financial news articles to detect macroeconomic shocks like the Asian Financial Crisis
- Government policy tracking for a public affairs consultancy, scanning official announcements to pinpoint the timing and scope of infrastructure stimulus packages
- Academic literature survey for an economic research team, programmatically aggregating and ranking papers that discuss 1997 stimulus measures in China
- Regulatory compliance monitoring for a law firm, continuously querying legal databases to flag new construction financing regulations and government directives
- Crisis response planning for an emergency management NGO, analyzing historical search data to understand how past governments deployed stimulus in the face of financial turmoil
- Historical curriculum development for an educational publisher, systematically gathering and synthesizing source material on China’s 1997 economic policies
- Journalism beat reporting for a finance correspondent, automating the discovery and summarization of top-scoring articles on regional financial crises and policy reactions

### Development Step 4: Locate 1851 Atheistic Naturalism Phrenology Mesmerism Book and 2009 Reissuing Publisher

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify a co-authored book from 1851 that advocated for atheistic naturalism, systematically explored phrenology and mesmerism, was controversial for these topics, and was reissued by a publisher in 2009. Search using keywords including '1851 book atheistic naturalism phrenology mesmerism co-authored', '1851 controversial book phrenology mesmerism reissued 2009', 'atheistic naturalism 1851 publication', and 'phrenology mesmerism 1851 authors'. Focus on identifying both the original 1851 publication details and the specific publisher who reissued it in 2009.

**Use Cases**:
- University research library digitization team using the multi-engine search script to locate and verify obscure 1851 scientific texts for digital archive inclusion and confirm 2009 reissue details.
- Historical society librarian employing automated Google Scholar, Bing, JSTOR, and archive.org queries to compile a complete bibliography of co-authored controversial phrenology and mesmerism treatises for a museum exhibition.
- Digital humanities scholar mapping the spread of atheistic naturalism by systematically harvesting primary sources and modern reprint information from multiple search engines for network analysis.
- Rare bookseller validating a potential 1851 first edition’s provenance by cross-referencing academic databases and general web searches to confirm authorship, publication history, and a 2009 specialty press reissue.
- PhD candidate in history of science leveraging the Python multi-method search to uncover mid-19th century philosophical works on phrenology and mesmerism across library catalogs and online archives for dissertation research.
- Independent publisher’s research team discovering forgotten public domain texts for annotated reissues by scanning academic sites and search engines to identify obscure co-authored volumes and track modern rights holders.
- Data journalist investigating the revival of fringe-science publications by extracting publication metadata and reissue patterns from search logs to illustrate how 19th-century controversial works reappear in contemporary niche markets.

    "description": "Implementing a comprehensive multi-query web search strategy to identify the book 'Sacred Desire' and its protagonist. This approach uses DuckDuckGo's multi-backend search capability to execute 10 different keyword combinations targeting: (1) the book title 'Sacred Desire', (2) protagonist characteristics (former Soviet paratrooper), (3) organizational co-founding activities, and (4) the 1992 crackdown context. The code includes detailed relevance scoring based on key terms, categorizes findings into book candidates and protagonist details, and provides extensive logging for analysis. Results are saved to workspace/sacred_desire_comprehensive_search_results.json for further investigation. This systematic approach should uncover information about the book's protagonist, their military background, the organization they co-founded, and the circumstances surrounding their flight during the 1992 crackdown.",

However, there's a critical bug causing 'NameError: name combined_text is not defined' that prevented proper analysis of search results. The error occurs during relevance scoring for each result, causing the analysis to fail after processing only the first result from each query. **PLAN** alignment: 30% - searches executed but analysis incomplete due to variable scope error. The code found some book candidates including 'Sacred Desire: Growing in Compassionate Living' and 'The Tribal Instinct: The Sacred Desire for People and Place', but couldn't properly evaluate their relevance to the Soviet paratrooper protagonist criteria. Immediate fix needed: Move the 'combined_text = f'{title.lower()} {body.lower()}'' line to before the relevance scoring logic, or define it at the start of the result processing loop.",

    "description": "Fixing the critical bug from the previous search attempt by properly defining the 'combined_text' variable before using it in relevance scoring. This implementation: (1) First inspects the existing search results file structure to understand the data format, (2) Re-analyzes all 150 previously collected search results with corrected logic to properly calculate relevance scores and categorize findings, (3) Conducts 5 additional targeted searches focusing specifically on Soviet paratroopers, organizations, and 1992 crackdowns without requiring the 'Sacred Desire' title match, (4) Provides comprehensive analysis of both corrected previous results and new findings, and (5) Saves all corrected analysis to workspace files. This approach should identify any relevant information about Soviet paratroopers who co-founded organizations and fled during 1992 crackdowns, even if the specific book 'Sacred Desire' is not found in search results.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - Code attempted to fix the previous 'combined_text' variable scope error and re-analyze existing search results, but encountered the same NameError again at line 99. The error occurs in a generator expression where 'combined_text' is referenced before being defined in that scope. The code successfully loaded previous search results (10 items) and began corrected analysis, processing the first result ('Sacred Desire: Growing in Compassionate Living' with score 5), but crashed before completing the re-analysis. **PLAN** alignment: 15% - data loading successful but analysis still broken. The additional targeted searches for Soviet paratrooper organizations and 1992 crackdowns were never executed due to the early failure. Immediate fix needed: Define 'combined_text' variable properly within the scope where it's used, specifically before the generator expression on line 99. The bug is in the categorization logic where 'combined_text' is referenced in list comprehensions but not accessible in that scope.",

This implementation: (1) Properly inspects the existing search results file structure before attempting to access its contents, (2) Re-analyzes all previous search results with corrected logic by defining 'combined_text' in the proper scope before using it in any conditional statements, (3) Eliminates the problematic generator expressions that caused the NameError by using direct variable checks instead, (4) Conducts 7 additional targeted searches focusing on Soviet paratroopers, organizations, and 1992 crackdowns without requiring 'Sacred Desire' in the title, (5) Implements comprehensive relevance scoring with 6 different indicators, and (6) Saves both corrected analysis and new search results to separate workspace files. The bug fix ensures that 'combined_text' is defined locally within each result processing loop before being used in any conditional logic, preventing the scope issues that caused previous failures.",

The implementation successfully: (1) Fixed the previous 'combined_text' variable scope issue and re-analyzed all 10 existing search results with corrected relevance scoring, (2) Conducted 7 additional targeted searches collecting 95+ new results focused on Soviet paratroopers and 1992 events, (3) Found several highly relevant results including information about Juma Namangani (a figure who fled to Tajikistan in 1992 following a crackdown) and various Soviet/Russian military organizations from that period, (4) Properly categorized findings with 0 high-relevance results for 'Sacred Desire' specifically but multiple relevant matches for Soviet paratrooper organizations and 1992 crackdowns. **PLAN** alignment: 85% complete - extensive search conducted and relevant information about Soviet paratroopers and 1992 organizational crackdowns was found, though no specific 'Sacred Desire' book was identified. The code created two comprehensive analysis files: 'workspace/sacred_desire_corrected_analysis.json' and 'workspace/sacred_desire_additional_searches.json'.

    "description": "Conducting a final comprehensive search for the book 'Sacred Desire' with its Soviet paratrooper protagonist. This implementation: (1) First inspects existing search result files to understand what information has already been collected, (2) Executes 8 highly targeted final searches specifically focused on finding 'Sacred Desire' with various combinations of the key protagonist characteristics, (3) Implements enhanced relevance scoring specifically calibrated for Sacred Desire book identification with a 10-point bonus for exact title matches, (4) Categorizes results into Sacred Desire candidates (exact title matches) and high-relevance findings (score ≥ 8), (5) Provides detailed analysis of any Sacred Desire book candidates found, and (6) Saves comprehensive final results to workspace. The search strategy uses multiple search engines and refined query variations to maximize the chance of finding this specific book, while the scoring system prioritizes exact 'Sacred Desire' title matches combined with Soviet paratrooper, organization co-founding, and 1992 crackdown elements.",

    "feedback": "Execution failed - Code ran and successfully conducted 8 final targeted searches for 'Sacred Desire' collecting 120 new results, but encountered a critical NameError: 'combined_text' is not defined during result analysis processing. The searches executed successfully and found results, but the same variable scope bug that plagued previous attempts occurred again during the relevance scoring phase. **PLAN** alignment: 40% - searches completed but analysis incomplete due to recurring bug. The code shows it has extensive previous search data (3 JSON files with corrected analysis, additional searches, and comprehensive results) but the current final search attempt failed to properly analyze the new 'Sacred Desire' focused results. The conclusion correctly identifies that 'Sacred Desire' was not found despite extensive searching across multiple engines and query variations, suggesting it may be fictional, very obscure, or known by a different title. Immediate fix needed: The 'combined_text' variable definition issue needs to be resolved once and for all - it should be defined within the result processing loop before any conditional logic that references it. The comprehensive search effort shows no specific 'Sacred Desire' book with Soviet paratrooper protagonist was found, indicating the book may not exist or is extremely obscure.",

This implementation: (1) Systematically inspects all existing Sacred Desire search files in workspace to understand their structure, (2) Extracts and analyzes results from different file formats (all_results, new_results, results, etc.), (3) Fixes the variable scope issue by properly defining 'text_content' within the local scope before any conditional logic, (4) Implements detailed scoring for Sacred Desire exact matches with bonus points for Soviet paratrooper characteristics, (5) Categorizes findings into Sacred Desire exact matches, Soviet paratrooper matches, and organization 1992 matches, (6) Provides comprehensive statistics on the entire search effort, and (7) Generates a definitive conclusion about whether the book was found. The analysis will finally determine if 'Sacred Desire' with the specified protagonist exists in the search results or if the extensive search effort confirms it may be fictional or extremely obscure.",

The implementation successfully: (1) Analyzed 4 existing search result files containing corrected analysis, additional searches, and comprehensive results, (2) Re-analyzed 104 total search results from previous attempts with fixed logic, properly defining 'combined_text' variables, (3) Found 6 Sacred Desire exact matches but with low relevance scores (all scored 10, only matching the title), (4) Identified 16 Soviet paratrooper matches and 3 organization 1992 matches from the broader search, (5) Created a comprehensive final analysis file with detailed categorization and scoring. **PLAN** alignment: 95% complete - extensive multi-phase search conducted across multiple search engines with various query combinations. The analysis reveals that while 'Sacred Desire' books exist (like 'Sacred Desire: Growing in Compassionate Living' and 'The Tribal Instinct: The Sacred Desire for People and Place'), none contain the specific Soviet paratrooper protagonist who co-founded an organization and fled during a 1992 crackdown. The comprehensive search effort strongly suggests this specific book with the described protagonist characteristics either does not exist, is fictional/hypothetical, or is extremely obscure. Recommend saving the detailed analysis output to a file for reference, as it contains valuable findings about actual Soviet paratrooper organizations and 1992 events that were discovered during the search process.",
