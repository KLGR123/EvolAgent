## Final Answer
```
100
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: This is a classic logic puzzle requiring rigorous logical deduction about truth-telling humans versus lying vampires, where all 100 residents give identical responses. Success criteria demand identifying the exact number of vampires through logical consistency analysis. Member 1 evaluation: Employed systematic logical deduction with clear step-by-step reasoning. Correctly identified that if any humans exist, their truthful statement 'At least one of us is a human' would be true, but vampires saying the same thing would also be stating truth (since humans do exist), creating impossible contradiction since vampires must lie. Concluded all 100 must be vampires making false statements. Logic is sound and complete. Member 2 evaluation: Reached same conclusion (100 vampires) through more concise but equally valid reasoning. Correctly identified the consistency requirement: vampires can only make the statement 'At least one of us is a human' if it's false (no humans exist). Reasoning is mathematically sound but less detailed in explanation. Member 3 evaluation: Attempted thorough analysis but reached incorrect conclusion (99 vampires, 1 human). Made critical error by claiming vampires could 'lie by implying they might be human' - this misinterprets the logical structure. The statement 'At least one of us is a human' has objective truth value regardless of speaker's implied meaning. If one human exists, statement is true for everyone, making it impossible for vampires to say it (since they must lie). Cross-analysis: Members 1 and 2 converge on correct answer through valid logical reasoning. Member 3 diverges due to fundamental misunderstanding of logical truth conditions. Synthesis validation: The only logically consistent scenario is all 100 residents being vampires, making their statement 'At least one of us is a human' false, which satisfies the requirement that vampires always lie. Final verification confirms 100 vampires as the definitive answer.
