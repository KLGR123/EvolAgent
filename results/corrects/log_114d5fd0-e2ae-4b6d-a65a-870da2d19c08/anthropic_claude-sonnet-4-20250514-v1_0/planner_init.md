    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive analysis of 'A Dark Trace: Sigmund Freud on the Sense of Guilt' by H. Westerink (DOI 10.1353/book.24372), the developer has definitively identified that Rudolf Kleinpaul influenced Sigmund Freud's belief in 'endopsychic myths' through his 1898 book 'Die Lebendigen und die Toten in Volksglauben, Religion und Sage' (The Living and the Dead in Folk Belief, Religion and Legend). The text explicitly states that after studying Kleinpaul's work, Freud discovered the existence of 'endopsychic myths.' Final answer: Kleinpaul.",
