## Final Answer
```
Harmony
```

## True Answer
```
Nauvoo, Illinois
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the town where a religious organization started a 1962 property acquisition project, after placing a 1960 monument at a historic site involving restoration of religious authority, with the site receiving AASLH 2016 designation. All three members correctly identified The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the religious organization and the 1960 Aaronic Priesthood Restoration Monument at the Priesthood Restoration Site in Harmony, Pennsylvania. However, critical divergence emerged regarding the 1962 project location. Member 1 evaluation: Conducted systematic research identifying Harmony/Oakland, Pennsylvania as both the 1960 monument location AND the 1962 property project location, with comprehensive verification of AASLH 2016 designation. Demonstrated methodological rigor with 31+ findings and multiple corroborating sources. Member 2 evaluation: Also identified Harmony, Pennsylvania as the location for both the 1960 monument and 1962 project, achieving 100% success rate with strong geographic evidence and cross-referencing. Provided consistent findings with Member 1. Member 3 evaluation: Correctly identified the 1960 monument in Harmony, Pennsylvania, but incorrectly concluded the 1962 project occurred in Nauvoo, Illinois through Nauvoo Restoration Incorporated, despite acknowledging this was a separate initiative. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on Harmony, Pennsylvania for both events, while Member 3 conflated two different LDS restoration projects. The task specifically asks for the town where the 1962 project started 'after placing a monument in 1960' - indicating geographic continuity. Members 1 and 2 provide evidence that the LDS Church's 1962 property activities occurred in the same Harmony/Oakland, Pennsylvania area as the 1960 monument. Member 3's Nauvoo conclusion, while factually accurate about a separate LDS restoration project, fails to establish the required connection to the specific 1960 monument location. Integration assessment: The weight of evidence from Members 1 and 2, with their detailed local research and geographic consistency, supports Harmony as the answer.
