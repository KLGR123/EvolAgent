The previous analysis has fully accomplished the PLAN requirements by parsing the North American railroad museum Excel file, identifying all 7 steam locomotives in the collection through their wheel configuration patterns, and calculating the total number of wheels across all steam locomotives. The final answer is 60 total wheels for all steam locomotives in the museum collection (locomotive #1060: 4 wheels, #31: 4 wheels, #18: 8 wheels, #825: 8 wheels, #52: 10 wheels, #89: 12 wheels, #266: 14 wheels). The analysis properly distinguished steam locomotives from diesel and other locomotive types, provided detailed calculations with verification, and saved comprehensive results to workspace/steam_locomotive_wheel_analysis.json. No further development is needed as the task is complete with 100% PLAN alignment.',

### Compute odds of today’s Sunset Picnic Trip using a steam locomotive

**TASK**: The attached file lists the locomotives owned by a local railroad museum. It gives each locomotive’s identifying number, operating status, and the name of the daily excursion it heads, if operational. What are the odds that today’s Sunset Picnic Trip will use a steam locomotive? Assume that each day’s excursion picks one of its assigned locomotives at random, and express the answer in the form “1 in 4”, “1 in 5”, etc. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/4d0aa727-86b1-406b-9b33-f870dd14a4a5.xlsx

All locomotives assigned to the 'Sunset Picnic Trip' were successfully identified: locomotive #1060 (steam, 0-4-0 wheel configuration), locomotive #93 (diesel, NW2), and locomotive #57 (diesel, GP30). The locomotive types were correctly classified using wheel configuration patterns for steam locomotives and model designations for diesel locomotives. The probability analysis was completed showing 1 steam locomotive versus 2 diesel locomotives on the Sunset Picnic Trip, resulting in 33.3% probability for steam, 66.7% probability for diesel, with odds ratio of 1:2 (steam:diesel). Complete results including locomotive details, classification logic, and probability calculations were saved to workspace/sunset_picnic_locomotive_analysis.json.
