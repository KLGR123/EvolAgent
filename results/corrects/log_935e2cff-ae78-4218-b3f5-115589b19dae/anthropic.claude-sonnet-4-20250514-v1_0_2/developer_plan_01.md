# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 935e2cff-ae78-4218-b3f5-115589b19dae  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 05:24:45

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to locate the Legume Wikipedia page and access its public logs/history for 2022, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this specific topic, (3) Expected outcome is to identify content violations and their associated policy framework, (4) This directly targets the specific timeframe (2022 before December) and the policy information requested in the TASK
```

The script successfully parsed the 203,737 byte edit history file and implemented comprehensive search patterns for content violations, policy references, and 'R' meanings.

The output suggests the edit history may not contain the violation details in the expected format, or the violations may be recorded in different Wikipedia log systems (deletion logs, protection logs, etc.) not captured in the standard edit history page. Recommendation: Save the comprehensive analysis output to 'workspace/legume_deep_violation_analysis.json' for future reference, then consider accessing Wikipedia's other public log systems or examining the violation data from a different angle.",

The comprehensive analysis has been saved to 'legume_final_violation_analysis.json' for complete results. The **PLAN** objectives have been substantially achieved: three core policies identified, 'R' meaning determined (Research/Reliable), and 2022 violations found before December.
