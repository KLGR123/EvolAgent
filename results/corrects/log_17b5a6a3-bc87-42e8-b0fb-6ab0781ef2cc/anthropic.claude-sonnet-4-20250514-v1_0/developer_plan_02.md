# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 17b5a6a3-bc87-42e8-b0fb-6ab0781ef2cc  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-06 17:13:31

## Plan Content
```
Convert the Florida location data from the USGS record (Pinellas County, Fred Howard Park area in Holiday, FL) to the specific five-digit ZIP codes for that geographic area. Cross-reference multiple sources including USPS ZIP code databases, local government records, and mapping services to ensure accuracy of the ZIP codes covering the Fred Howard Park and Holiday, Florida region where the clownfish specimen was documented.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) The developer successfully identified the clownfish species and found the USGS nonnative occurrence record from 2018 in Florida, (2) The location data shows Pinellas County/Fred Howard Park/Holiday FL area with potential ZIP codes 34690-34691, but we need to verify the exact ZIP codes for the documented location, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain the precise five-digit ZIP codes where the nonnative clownfish was found according to USGS records, (4) This completes the TASK by providing the required ZIP code format for the answer.

### Development Step 21: Map bachelor’s-degree universities of pre-April 2019 Homeland Security Secretaries; identify easternmost and westernmost coordinates.

**Description**: Research the geographic locations of all universities where former US Secretaries of Homeland Security (who served prior to April 2019, excluding acting secretaries) obtained their bachelor's degrees. Identify the longitude and latitude coordinates for each university to determine which is the westernmost and which is the easternmost.

**Use Cases**:
- Government policy research using geocoded alma mater data of former DHS secretaries to analyze regional education influences on homeland security strategies
- University alumni relations teams mapping high-profile government alumni locations to plan targeted fundraising events at westernmost and easternmost campuses
- News organizations creating interactive geographic visualizations of Homeland Security secretaries’ educational backgrounds for in-depth investigative reporting
- Academic GIS and data science courses using the pipeline to teach students real-world geocoding workflows and extreme value detection in geographic datasets
- Event coordinators organizing homeland security symposiums on campuses identified as westernmost and easternmost alma maters of DHS secretaries to maximize regional outreach
- Political science researchers correlating the geographic distribution of senior government officials’ undergraduate institutions with regional policy outcomes in homeland security studies
- Educational accreditation agencies automating verification of leadership education locations by integrating geocoded institutional data into compliance dashboards
- Human resources intelligence teams incorporating geocoded education data of former DHS secretaries into executive profile dashboards for strategic talent planning

### Development Step 19: Sort birth cities from presidential_birthplaces.json records with minimum and maximum longitudes

**Description**: Identify the records in workspace/presidential_birthplaces.json with the minimum longitude and the maximum longitude, extract their birth_city values, sort those two city names alphabetically, and output them as a comma-separated list.

**Use Cases**:
- Identifying the westernmost and easternmost presidential birth cities to generate an interactive U.S. history road-trip planner featuring state travel tips
- Automating quality assurance in a government GIS dataset by flagging records with extreme longitude values for manual verification
- Powering an educational app module that quizzes students on the geography of presidential birthplaces by highlighting the two farthest apart cities
- Generating a dynamic map overlay for a political news website that marks the easternmost and westernmost birth locations of U.S. presidents
- Enriching a travel blog’s “Presidential Routes” section by automatically extracting and alphabetically sorting the extreme-longitude birth cities
- Supporting a demographic research project that analyzes geographic dispersion of presidential birthplaces by isolating boundary cases
- Integrating into a civic-education chatbot to quickly answer “Which president was born farthest west or east?” by fetching and sorting birth city names

### Development Step 20: Geolocating Bachelor’s Degree Universities of Pre-2019 DHS Secretaries: Identifying Westernmost and Easternmost Campuses

**Description**: Research the geographic locations of all universities where former US Secretaries of Homeland Security (who served prior to April 2019, excluding acting secretaries) obtained their bachelor's degrees. Identify the longitude and latitude coordinates for each university to determine which is the westernmost and which is the easternmost.

**Use Cases**:
- General automation and data processing tasks
- Custom scripting and workflow optimization

### Development Step 13: Compile U.S. Presidents’ Birth Cities and Coordinates into presidential_birthplaces.json

**Description**: Collect a complete list of all United States presidents with their official birth city names and state names, then obtain the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) for each birth city using authoritative sources such as official presidential biographies or Wikipedia infoboxes. Save the results in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON) at workspace/presidential_birthplaces.json.

**Use Cases**:
- Interactive educational web map for high school history classes, allowing students to explore U.S. presidents by birthplace with geospatial visualization.
- Historical research and spatial analysis for political science studies examining regional birth origin patterns of U.S. presidents over time.
- Heritage tourism itinerary planner presenting a “Presidential Birthplaces Trail,” using precise coordinates to guide visitors to birth sites and museums.
- Automated data pipeline feeding a civic engagement platform, mapping congressional districts relative to presidential birth cities for targeted outreach programs.
- Interactive quiz and trivia mobile app that generates location-based questions (e.g., “Which president was born near these coordinates?”) using the JSON dataset.
- News media interactive infographic tool that visualizes presidential birthplaces on election anniversaries to enhance storytelling with accurate geolocation.
- GIS integration for a university digital humanities project, combining presidential birthplace coordinates with demographic layers to analyze historical migration trends.
- Genealogical research platform enhancing family tree profiles by linking presidential ancestors to exact birth locations and enriching narratives with map context.

The approach uses multiple methods: (1) Direct lookup of Holiday, FL ZIP codes (34690, 34691), (2) Research of Fred Howard Park specific location (34689 for the park entrance at 1700 Sunset Point Rd), and (3) Validation of ZIP code formats. The code cross-references known USPS data and local geographic information to ensure accuracy. Results include detailed information about each ZIP code, their coverage areas, and relationship to Fred Howard Park. The final output provides a comprehensive mapping of the geographic area to its corresponding five-digit ZIP codes, saved to workspace/florida_zip_codes.json for further reference.',
