## Final Answer
```
1954
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the specific year when American Alligators were first documented west of Texas according to USGS records. All three members conducted systematic searches of USGS databases, specifically the Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Database. Member 1 evaluation: Provided comprehensive chronological documentation showing California (1954), Colorado (1978), Arizona (1990), and Nevada (2009), with clear identification of 1954 as the earliest western occurrence. Demonstrated thorough database analysis with complete timeline documentation. Member 2 evaluation: Reached identical conclusion with California 1954 as the first western documentation, followed by Colorado (1978) and Arizona (1990). Showed strong methodological alignment with Member 1 and provided detailed source verification from USGS NAS Database. Member 3 evaluation: Concluded 1978 in California, citing Bury and Luckenbach (1978) as primary source, but appears to have missed earlier 1954 California records that Members 1 and 2 identified. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on 1954 California finding, with Member 3 identifying a later but well-documented 1978 California occurrence. All members correctly identified these as non-indigenous introductions rather than natural range expansion. Divergence resolution: The discrepancy stems from database search depth - Members 1 and 2 accessed more complete historical records showing the 1954 California occurrence, while Member 3 found the well-documented 1978 Bury and Luckenbach study but missed earlier entries. Synthesis validation: Multiple independent confirmations of 1954 California occurrence from Members 1 and 2, both accessing official USGS NAS Database with comprehensive historical coverage. Final answer 1954 represents the earliest USGS-documented occurrence west of Texas.
