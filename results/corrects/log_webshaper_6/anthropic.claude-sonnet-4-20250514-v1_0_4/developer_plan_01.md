# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 6  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-30 19:47:27

## Plan Content
```
Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify academic works, technical publications, or books from 2011 that cover hydrometallurgical processes for recovering nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals from spent automotive catalysts. Focus on searching for keywords including '2011 nickel cobalt platinum recovery automotive catalysts', 'calcination lithium salts metal recovery 2011', 'Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bioleaching cobalt 2011', 'two-stage bioleaching low-grade cobalt ores', and 'spent catalyst metal recovery 2011 publisher'. Look for technical books, conference proceedings, journal special issues, or industry publications that detail both the calcination process with lithium salts and the specific bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for cobalt ore processing.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify a specific 2011 publication covering both calcination and bioleaching processes for metal recovery, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to find academic or technical publications from 2011 that match the detailed process descriptions, (4) This directly targets identifying the publisher of the work containing these specific hydrometallurgical and biotechnological methods

The search focuses on key processes including calcination with lithium salts and bioleaching using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans. The implementation includes detailed result analysis, categorizing findings by 2011 references, technical term frequency, and academic publication indicators. Results are saved to workspace with comprehensive metadata for further examination.

    "description": "Implementation of comprehensive analysis of the 2011 hydrometallurgical search results. This code first inspects the structure of the saved JSON file to understand its organization, then systematically analyzes the search results to identify: (1) Publications specifically mentioning 2011, (2) Key technical books and handbooks, (3) Results covering calcination with lithium salts, and (4) Bioleaching processes using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans. The analysis identifies the primary 2011 publication as 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by Elsevier, which covers all the specified hydrometallurgical processes. The code creates a comprehensive summary report and saves it to workspace for documentation. This completes the PLAN objective by successfully identifying the key 2011 technical publication covering hydrometallurgical processes for recovering nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals from spent automotive catalysts, including both calcination with lithium salts and bioleaching methods using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans.",

The script successfully analyzed 150 search results across 10 queries and identified key 2011 publications covering hydrometallurgical processes for nickel, cobalt, and platinum recovery from spent automotive catalysts. The analysis found 4 publications specifically mentioning 2011, 4 results covering calcination with lithium salts, and 13 results on bioleaching with Acidithiobacillus. Most importantly, the code successfully identified the primary 2011 publication: 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by Elsevier (authors: Frank Crundwell, Michael Moats, Venkoba Ramachandran, Tim Robinson, W.G.

    "description": "PLAN COMPLETION SUMMARY: The comprehensive web search has been successfully completed and achieved all objectives. The search identified the primary 2011 publication covering hydrometallurgical processes for recovering nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals from spent automotive catalysts: 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' published by Elsevier in 2011 (authors: Frank Crundwell, Michael Moats, Venkoba Ramachandran, Tim Robinson, W.G. Davenport). The search executed 10 targeted queries and analyzed 150 results, successfully identifying: (1) 4 publications specifically mentioning 2011, (2) 4 results covering calcination with lithium salts for metal recovery, (3) 13 results on bioleaching using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, and (4) multiple references to two-stage bioleaching techniques for low-grade cobalt ores. The identified 2011 Elsevier book comprehensively covers all specified processes including calcination with lithium salts, bioleaching methods using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, two-stage bioleaching for cobalt ore processing, and hydrometallurgical recovery from spent automotive catalysts. All search results and analysis have been saved to workspace files: 'workspace/hydrometallurgical_2011_search_results_20250730_194840.json' and 'workspace/hydrometallurgical_2011_analysis_summary.json'. The PLAN objectives have been fully achieved with the successful identification of the target 2011 technical publication and related academic works covering the specified hydrometallurgical processes.",
