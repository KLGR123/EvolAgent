    "description": "Initial comprehensive research phase for Yola word 'gimlie' etymology. This implementation conducts 8 targeted Google searches using various combinations of keywords (Yola language, gimlie, etymology, Latin, Forth and Bargy, etc.) to gather academic and linguistic sources. The code systematically searches for documentation about the Yola language and specifically the word 'gimlie', analyzes results for relevance based on keyword matching, and identifies the most promising sources for further investigation. Results are saved to workspace/yola_gimlie_search_results.json and workspace/yola_gimlie_relevant_sources.json for detailed analysis. This establishes a foundation for finding the Latin root etymology of 'gimlie' by first mapping the available scholarly resources and linguistic documentation about the extinct Yola dialect.",

The search strategy worked well, finding 49 total results across 8 targeted queries and identifying 35 relevant sources with 26 sources containing specific 'gimlie' mentions. Key findings discovered: (1) 'gimlie' means 'chimney' in Yola, (2) Wiktionary shows it derives from Late Latin, (3) One source indicates the etymology path: Yola 'gimlie' ← Middle English 'chimeney' ← Old French 'cheminee' ← Late Latin 'camīnāta', and (4) Multiple references to Jacob Poole's historical Yola glossary from Forth and Bargy baronies. However, the **PLAN** objective to identify the specific Latin root word is only partially achieved - while 'Late Latin camīnāta' is mentioned in one source, this needs verification from the actual Wiktionary page or Poole's glossary. **PLAN** alignment: 80% complete. Next step: Access the Wiktionary page directly (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gimlie) to get the complete etymology chain and confirm the exact Latin root, as this appears to be the most authoritative source found.",
