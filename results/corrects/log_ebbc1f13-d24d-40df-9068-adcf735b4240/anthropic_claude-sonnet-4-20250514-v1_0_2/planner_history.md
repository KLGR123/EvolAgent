Search for linguistic sources, dictionaries, or academic materials that document Yola language vocabulary and etymology, specifically focusing on finding the Latin origin of the word 'gimlie' and determining what Latin word it derives from.",
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to establish the Latin etymology of the Yola word 'gimlie' before we can identify any Spanish cognates, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this linguistic investigation, (3) Expected outcome is to find authoritative sources documenting Yola language etymology and identify the specific Latin root of 'gimlie', (4) This provides the foundation needed to then search for Spanish words sharing the same spelling as that Latin root",

    "description": "Research objective completed successfully. The PLAN to identify the Latin root etymology of the Yola word 'gimlie' has been fully accomplished through comprehensive research and direct source verification. \n\n**Final Answer: The Latin root of the Yola word 'gimlie' is 'camīnāta'**\n\n**Complete Etymology Chain:**\n- Yola: gimlie (meaning 'chimney')\n- ← Middle English: chimeney  \n- ← Old French: cheminee\n- ← Late Latin: camīnāta (meaning 'room with a chimney')\n\n**Research Summary:**\n1. **Initial Search Phase**: Conducted 8 targeted Google searches using SerpAPI, gathering 49 total results and identifying 35 relevant sources with 26 containing specific 'gimlie' mentions\n\n2. **Key Sources Identified**: \n   - Wiktionary (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gimlie) - Primary authoritative source\n   - Jacob Poole's historical Yola glossary from Forth and Bargy baronies\n   - Category page for Yola terms derived from Late Latin\n\n3. **Direct Source Verification**: Successfully accessed and parsed the Wiktionary gimlie page, extracting the complete etymology: 'From Middle English chimeney, from Old French cheminee, from Late Latin camīnāta. Cognate with Scots chimlie.'\n\n4. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Confirmed findings through the related 'cheminee' page which provided additional etymological context\n\n**Files Created in workspace/:**\n- yola_gimlie_search_results.json (57,621 bytes) - Complete search data from 8 queries\n- yola_gimlie_relevant_sources.json (17,982 bytes) - Analyzed relevant sources with relevance scoring\n- wiktionary_gimlie_page.html (52,366 bytes) - Raw HTML from authoritative Wiktionary page\n- gimlie_etymology_findings.txt (283 bytes) - Extracted etymology findings\n\nThe research definitively establishes that the Yola word 'gimlie' derives from the Late Latin word 'camīnāta', completing the PLAN objective with authoritative linguistic documentation.",

Once the Spanish word 'caminata' is confirmed, access the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online to locate the 1994 example sentence for this word, identify the source title of that example sentence, and then use Google Translate to translate that source title from Spanish to English.",
    "description": "This is the logical next step because: (1) We have established that the Latin root of Yola 'gimlie' is 'camīnāta', and we need to find the Spanish word with matching spelling, (2) The previous research completed the etymology identification, (3) Expected outcome is to find the Spanish word 'caminata', locate its 1994 example sentence in Collins dictionary, and translate the source title, (4) This advances us toward the final answer by connecting the Latin root to Spanish vocabulary and accessing the specific dictionary entry requested in the TASK",

The PLAN to search for Spanish words sharing the exact spelling \'caminata\' with the Latin root \'camīnāta\' from previous research, locate the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary 1994 example sentence, identify its source title, and translate it to English using Google Translate has been fully accomplished.\n\n**Final Answer: The Google translation of the source title is "The Tales of Magical Reality"**\n\n**Complete Research Chain:**\n1. **Latin Root Confirmed**: camīnāta (from Late Latin, meaning \'room with a chimney\') - the etymology of Yola word \'gimlie\'\n2. **Spanish Word Verified**: caminata (shares exact spelling with Latin root) - meaning \'long walk\', \'hike\', \'trek\', or \'ramble\'\n3. **Collins Dictionary 1994 Example Located**: "Si nosotros con este triste pollo nos hemos echado esta caminata.
