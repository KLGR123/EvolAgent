# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** bda648d7-d618-4883-88f4-3466eabd860e  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 20:23:03

## Plan Content
```
Search for Nedoshivina's 2010 paper that describes Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov. Focus on finding the complete bibliographic information and accessing the full text of this scientific publication. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or ResearchGate with search terms 'Nedoshivina 2010 Kuznetzov Vietnamese specimens', (2) Scientific journal databases focusing on taxonomy, entomology, or zoology depending on the subject matter, (3) Direct author searches for publications by Nedoshivina from 2010. Extract the paper's title, journal name, and locate information about specimen deposition or repository details mentioned in the materials and methods or acknowledgments sections.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify and access the specific 2010 paper by Nedoshivina that mentions Kuznetzov's Vietnamese specimens, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the full paper with specimen repository information, (4) This directly targets finding the deposition location required by the task
