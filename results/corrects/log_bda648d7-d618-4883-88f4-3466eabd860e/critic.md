## Final Answer
```
Saint Petersburg
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify the city where Vietnamese specimens described by Kuznetzov in Nedoshivina's 2010 paper were deposited, requiring specific bibliographic research and specimen repository information extraction. Individual member evaluation: All three members demonstrated strong research methodology and reached identical conclusions through systematic academic database searches. Member 0 identified the paper as 'A catalogue of type specimens of the Tortricidae described by V.I. Kuznetzov from Vietnam and deposited in the Zoological Institute, St. Petersburg' published in Atalanta, 41: 335-347, with specimens deposited at the Zoological Institute, St. Petersburg. Member 1 initially referenced a different 2010 Nedoshivina paper on Gatesclarkeana but correctly identified the same repository location (ZISP - Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg). Member 2 provided identical findings with the same Atalanta paper citation and confirmed deposition at ZISP St. Petersburg. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence on final answer across all members, with slight divergence in initial paper identification by Member 1 but ultimate consensus on specimen location. All members demonstrated thorough research capabilities, proper academic database utilization, and accurate information extraction. Integration assessment: The consistent identification of St. Petersburg as the deposition city across multiple independent research approaches provides high confidence in accuracy. Final validation confirms that Vietnamese specimens described by Kuznetzov were deposited at the Zoological Institute (ZISP) in St. Petersburg, Russia, as documented in Nedoshivina's 2010 publication.
