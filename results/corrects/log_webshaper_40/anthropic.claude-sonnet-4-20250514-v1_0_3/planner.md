Based on the comprehensive search evidence visible in the HISTORY, both core objectives have been definitively answered with high-quality authoritative sources:\n\n**PLAN OBJECTIVE 1 - COMPLETED**: First Australian manager of professional English club identified as **Harry Kewell**, who was appointed head coach of **Crawley Town** (League Two) on **23 May 2017**, becoming the first Australian to coach a professional English side. This is confirmed by multiple Wikipedia sources and sports news outlets.\n\n**PLAN OBJECTIVE 2 - COMPLETED**: English club with Italian kit connections identified as **Notts County**, which has historical connections to **Juventus FC** through kit design inspiration dating to **1903**. Notts County inspired Juventus\' signature black and white striped kit design.
