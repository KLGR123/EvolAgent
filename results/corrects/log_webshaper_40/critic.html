                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                The question cannot be answered as it is based on historically inaccurate premises<br><br>
                <strong>True Answer:</strong><br>
                2008<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task analysis: The question asks for the death year of an Australian cricket captain from a specific Test match where Arthur Morris scored over 300 runs against New Zealand before 1973-74, marking the first Test where this feat was achieved. However, comprehensive analysis reveals multiple factual errors in the premise. Member 1 conducted the most thorough and accurate analysis, systematically identifying that: (1) Arthur Morris never scored over 300 runs in any Test innings - his highest Test score was 206 runs, with statistical records showing '300s: 0' for his career, (2) No Test match between Australia and New Zealand before 1973-74 featured any player scoring 300+ runs, (3) The first Australia vs New Zealand Test was March 29-30, 1946 at Wellington, where Australia won by an innings and 103 runs with no individual score exceeding 300. Member 1 correctly identified that Don Bradman scored the first 300+ Test innings (334 vs England at Leeds in 1930) with Bill Woodfull as captain, but this was against England, not New Zealand. Member 2 reached similar conclusions through independent research, confirming no Australia-New Zealand Test before 1973-74 had 300+ individual scores. Member 3 incorrectly identified Greg Chappell's 1974 performance (which occurred after the 1973-74 cutoff) and conflated multiple historical events. Cross-analysis shows strong convergence between Members 1 and 2 on the fundamental historical inaccuracy, while Member 3's approach contained chronological and factual errors. The question premise contains multiple impossible conditions that cannot be reconciled with cricket history.
