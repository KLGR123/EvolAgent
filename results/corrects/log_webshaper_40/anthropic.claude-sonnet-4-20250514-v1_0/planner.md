Based on the comprehensive search evidence visible in the HISTORY, both core objectives have been definitively answered with high-quality authoritative sources:\n\n**PLAN OBJECTIVE 1 - COMPLETED**: First Australian manager of professional English club identified as **Harry Kewell**, who was appointed head coach of **Crawley Town** (League Two) on **23 May 2017**, becoming the first Australian to coach a professional English side. This is confirmed by multiple Wikipedia sources and sports news outlets.\n\n**PLAN OBJECTIVE 2 - COMPLETED**: English club with Italian kit connections identified as **Notts County**, which has historical connections to **Juventus FC** through kit design inspiration dating to **1903**. Notts County inspired Juventus\' signature black and white striped kit design. This is confirmed by Goal.com and multiple football history sources with the specific evidence: "The Italian giants are known for their signature black-and-white zebra stripes on their kits - and Notts County have something to do with it."\n\n**PLAN OBJECTIVE 3 - COMPLETED**: Cross-reference of historical kit donation story confirmed - Notts County → Juventus kit inspiration (1903) with black and white stripes connection established through multiple search results.\n\n**SEARCH EXECUTION STATUS**: The comprehensive search strategy successfully executed 8+ targeted API queries across multiple iterations, finding highly relevant results from authoritative sources (Wikipedia, Goal.com, sports news). Despite a persistent variable scoping error in the result processing loop, the search successfully retrieved and displayed the exact information needed to answer both PLAN objectives.\n\n**EVIDENCE QUALITY**: HIGH - Multiple authoritative sources including Wikipedia (Harry Kewell appointment details), Goal.com (Juventus-Notts County kit connection), and sports news outlets providing cross-validation of the findings.\n\n**WORKSPACE FILES CREATED**: \n- australian_manager_search_complete_results.json (comprehensive search results)\n- australian_manager_complete_final_analysis.txt (detailed analysis)\n- australian_manager_final_search_[timestamp].json (final search results)\n\n**DEFINITIVE ANSWERS**:\n1. **First Australian manager of professional English club**: Harry Kewell (Crawley Town, 23 May 2017)\n2. **English club with Italian kit connections**: Notts County (inspired Juventus black/white stripes, 1903)\n\nThe PLAN has been 100% completed with comprehensive evidence from multiple authoritative sources, successfully identifying both the first Australian football manager to lead a professional English club and the English club\'s historical connections to Italian football through kit donations.',

Verify the information from reliable cricket databases, historical records, or official sources.",
    "description": "This is the necessary next step because: (1) The HISTORY has corrected the original TASK premise and identified that Bill Woodfull was the Australian captain when the first 300+ run Test innings occurred (Don Bradman's 334 at Leeds in 1930), not a match involving Arthur Morris who never scored over 300 runs, (2) We now need to determine when Bill Woodfull passed away to complete the TASK, (3) Expected outcome is to find Bill Woodfull's death year from authoritative cricket or historical sources, (4) This directly addresses the core question asking for the year of death of the Australian captain from the historically significant Test match",

    "description": 'Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted in the HISTORY, the original TASK premise contained a factual error - Arthur Morris never scored over 300 runs in any Test innings (his highest was 206). The research corrected this and identified that Don Bradman scored the first 300+ run Test innings (334 runs against England at Leeds in 1930), with Bill Woodfull as the Australian captain in that match. Further research confirmed that Bill Woodfull passed away on August 11, 1965, at age 67 in Tweed Heads, New South Wales, Australia. Final answer: 1965.',
