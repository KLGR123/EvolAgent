## Task Description
```
I thought we could try a fun word puzzle together :)

I've got a Boggle board here:

ABRL
EITE
IONS
FPEI

I'd like to know the longest word that can be generated from the board. Please find the longest English language word that can be generated from this board. If more than one word of the same length exists at the maximum word length, please report the longest word that comes first, alphabetically. Oh, and I know that there might be different wordlists available for Boggle, so let's please just use the words_alpha dictionary found at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words as the dictionary for our game.

### Alphabetized Botanical Vegetable List for Mom’s Strictly Categorized Grocery List

**TASK**: I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.

### Farthest U.S. Presidential Birth Cities East to West, Alphabetical List

**TASK**: Of the cities within the United States where U.S. presidents were born, which two are the farthest apart from the westernmost to the easternmost going east, giving the city names only? Give them to me in alphabetical order, in a comma-separated list

```

### Decrypt Caesar Cipher to Reveal Picnic Meeting Location

**TASK**: This is a secret message my friend gave me. It says where we should meet for our picnic on Friday. The only problem is, it’s encrypted in the Caesar cipher, so I can’t read it. Can you tell me what it says? This is the message:

Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.

```

    "role": 'planner',

The code systematically tested all 25 possible shift values and identified the correct decryption with shift value 10. The encrypted message 'Zsmxsm sc sx Zyvilsec Zvkjk.' decrypts to 'Picnic is in Polybius Plaza.' - a clear, readable English sentence that reveals the picnic meeting location. The analysis correctly identified this as the most likely candidate with a readability score of 12, containing recognizable English words 'picnic', 'is', 'in', and 'plaza'. The results have been saved to workspace files (picnic_location.txt and all_caesar_results.txt) for reference. The PLAN objective has been 100% achieved - the Caesar cipher has been successfully decrypted and the readable English location 'Polybius Plaza' has been definitively identified as the picnic meeting place.",

### Unlambda code: which character to add to output “For penguins”?

**TASK**: In Unlambda, what exact charcter or text needs to be added to correct the following code to output "For penguins"? If what is needed is a character, answer with the name of the character. If there are different names for the character, use the shortest. The text location is not needed. Code:

`r

    "role": 'planner',
    "plan": 'Research and analyze the Unlambda programming language to understand its syntax, specifically focusing on code structure that would output text strings like "For penguins".',
    "description": "This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand Unlambda's syntax to identify what's missing in the given code, (2) No prior research has been done on this language yet, (3) Expected outcome is to gain sufficient knowledge about Unlambda to analyze the provided code snippet, (4) Understanding the language fundamentals is critical before we can determine what character needs to be added to fix the code.",

I\'ve provided a comprehensive implementation that researches and analyzes the Unlambda programming language, with specific focus on understanding syntax for outputting text strings like "For penguins".\n\nThe code successfully created:\n1. A syntax reference document explaining Unlambda\'s core operators and principles\n2. A "Hello, World!" example with detailed explanation\n3. Two different implementations for outputting "For penguins" in Unlambda\n4. Additional examples showing different output patterns\n5. A comprehensive summary of findings\n\nThe key finding is that in Unlambda, to output a text string like "For penguins", we use the `.c` operator to print each character and chain these operations using the backtick (`) application operator. The complete solution is:\n``.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i\n\nAs confirmed by the tester\'s feedback, the code executed successfully and fully met the requirements specified in the PLAN. All necessary files were generated in the workspace directory, and the implementation thoroughly demonstrates how to create Unlambda code that outputs the desired text string.',

    "description": "Task completed successfully. After analyzing the Unlambda code, I've identified that the exact character needed to fix the code is the backtick (`). The given code lacks backticks between the dot operators. In Unlambda, `.c` prints character c, but these operations need to be connected with backticks (`) as application operators. The correct format should be: `.F`.o`.r`. `.p`.e`.n`.g`.u`.i`.n`.s`i. Final answer: backtick",
