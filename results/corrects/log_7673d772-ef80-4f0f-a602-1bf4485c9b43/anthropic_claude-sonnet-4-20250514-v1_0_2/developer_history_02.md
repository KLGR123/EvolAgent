The script accessed Cornell Law School's website and identified the main Federal Rules section at 'https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules'. It discovered 8 federal rules-related links including specific rule categories like Civil Procedure, Criminal Procedure, Evidence, Bankruptcy Procedure, and Appellate Procedure. The homepage analysis data was properly saved to 'workspace/cornell_law_homepage_analysis.json'. However, the **PLAN** is only partially complete (approximately 40%) - while we've located the federal rules section, we still need to navigate to that section, extract the complete list of all federal rule categories, arrange them alphabetically, and identify the fifth section.

I'm first inspecting the existing homepage analysis data to understand the site structure, then accessing the main federal rules page at '/rules'.

However, there's a significant issue with the analysis results. The code found only one rule containing 'witnesses' - 'ARTICLE VI. WITNESSES' - but this appears to be an article header rather than an individual rule title. The extraction captured mostly generic rule numbers (Rule 101, Rule 102, etc.) without their actual descriptive titles that would contain substantive content about witnesses. **PLAN** alignment: 60% complete - the technical framework works and data was processed, but the rule title extraction method may not be capturing the full descriptive titles where 'witnesses' would typically appear. Next step: Modify the extraction logic to access individual rule pages and extract their complete titles/headings, or look for a different page structure that displays full rule titles with descriptions rather than just rule numbers.",

    "description": "Building on the previous analysis that identified the limitation of only extracting rule numbers, I'm now implementing an enhanced approach that accesses individual rule pages to extract complete titles and content. This comprehensive method: (1) Loads previous rule URLs from the existing analysis, (2) Systematically visits each individual rule page, (3) Uses multiple extraction strategies to find complete rule titles (headings, CSS selectors, content areas), (4) Counts both 'witnesses' and 'witness' occurrences in extracted titles, (5) Provides fallback analysis of page content when titles don't contain witness references, and (6) Ranks rules by frequency of witness references. This approach addresses the tester's feedback by ensuring we capture the full descriptive titles where 'witnesses' would typically appear, rather than just generic rule numbers. The analysis includes proper error handling, rate limiting for server respect, and comprehensive documentation of results.",

    "feedback": "Execution successful - Code ran without errors and completed the **PLAN** requirements with significant improvement over the previous attempt. The script successfully accessed 69 individual Federal Rules of Evidence pages and extracted their complete titles, finding 13 rules with 'witnesses' or 'witness' references. The analysis correctly identified multiple rules with the highest frequency of witness references: Rules 611, 615, 701, 702, and 706 each contain 2 total references (1 'witnesses' + 1 'witness' each). Rule 611 'Mode and Order of Examining Witnesses and Presenting Evidence' was selected as the top result. The comprehensive analysis processed all rule pages individually, counted occurrences accurately, and provided detailed results with URLs. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - all objectives achieved including accessing individual rule pages, extracting complete titles, counting 'witnesses' occurrences, and identifying the rule with the most references.

    "description": "This implementation completes the PLAN by building upon the successful detailed analysis from the HISTORY. I'm first inspecting the existing detailed analysis file structure to understand the data format, then extracting and processing the comprehensive results to identify which Federal Rules of Evidence rule has the most occurrences of 'witnesses' in its title. The code: (1) Loads and inspects existing detailed analysis data, (2) Processes all rules to find those containing 'witnesses' or 'witness' references, (3) Ranks rules by total references and specifically by 'witnesses' count, (4) Identifies the rule(s) with the highest count, (5) Provides comprehensive statistics and final answer, and (6) Saves complete results. Based on the HISTORY showing successful extraction of 69 rules with 13 containing witness references, this analysis will definitively answer which rule has the most 'witnesses' occurrences as required by the PLAN.",

The script successfully loaded existing detailed analysis data and provided a complete answer to the research question. The analysis processed 69 Federal Rules of Evidence rules and found 13 rules containing 'witnesses' or 'witness' in their titles. The code correctly identified that 5 rules are tied for the most occurrences of 'witnesses' (plural) with 1 occurrence each: Rules 611, 615, 701, 702, and 706.
