The script accessed Cornell Law School's website and identified the main Federal Rules section at 'https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules'.

The homepage analysis data was properly saved to 'workspace/cornell_law_homepage_analysis.json'. However, the **PLAN** is only partially complete (approximately 40%) - while we've located the federal rules section, we still need to navigate to that section, extract the complete list of all federal rule categories, arrange them alphabetically, and identify the fifth section.

I'm first inspecting the existing homepage analysis data to understand the site structure, then accessing the main federal rules page at '/rules'.
