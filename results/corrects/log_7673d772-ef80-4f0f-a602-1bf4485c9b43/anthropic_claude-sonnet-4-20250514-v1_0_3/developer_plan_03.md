# Developer Plan 03

## Plan
Access Article VII - Opinions and Expert Testimony of the Federal Rules of Evidence on Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute website. Identify the first rule in this article (Rule 701: Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses) and research its amendment history to find the most recent amendment. Extract the specific text changes from the last amendment to determine what word was deleted.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have identified that Article VII - Opinions and Expert Testimony contains 'witnesses' in the most rule titles (3 occurrences) as of 2021, making it the target article, (2) The first rule in Article VII is Rule 701: Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses, which we need to examine for its amendment history, (3) Expected outcome is to locate the last amendment to Rule 701 and identify the specific word that was deleted, (4) This will provide the final answer to the TASK by examining the amendment history and text changes of the first rule in the article with the most 'witnesses' titles.

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 5: Testimony in 1933 Dillinger Jailbreak and Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern Gang Convictions

**Description**: Search specifically for information about the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger that resulted in the death of a sheriff and led to Harry Pierpont's conviction. Focus on identifying who provided testimony in this case and cross-reference with any testimony that also helped convict other gang leaders from the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang. Search for keywords including '1933 jailbreak John Dillinger fake credentials', 'Harry Pierpont sheriff death conviction', 'Lima Ohio jail break 1933', 'Dillinger escape plan testimony', and 'witness testimony Pierpont conviction'.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal research teams automating archival retrieval of witness testimony and court records to support precedent analysis in organized crime defense cases
- True-crime podcast producers aggregating and fact-checking 1930s jailbreak narratives and witness statements via API calls for immersive episode scripting
- Academic historians cross-referencing digital newspaper archives and trial transcripts to reconstruct the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang‚Äôs network for a peer-reviewed journal article
- Law enforcement cold-case units integrating JSON-formatted witness metadata and snippet analysis to uncover new leads in unsolved sheriff homicide investigations
- Educational technology platforms generating interactive timelines of historical jailbreak events by extracting dates, locations, and key participants from court document repositories
- Digital humanities researchers employing automated keyword searches and snippet classification to map testimony patterns across multiple 1930s bank robbery trials
- Investigative journalists conducting rapid background checks on historical criminal figures by cross-referencing API-fetched search results with court verdict data
- Insurance risk assessment teams analyzing historical crime incident data and witness testimony to model liability exposure for high-risk property underwriting

### Development Step 4: Identify Witnesses in 1933 Dillinger Fake-Credentials Jailbreak, Sheriff‚Äôs Death, and Pierpont-Bridgewater Convictions

**Description**: Search specifically for information about the 1933 jailbreak involving fake official credentials and a disputed escape plan found on John Dillinger that resulted in the death of a sheriff and led to Harry Pierpont's conviction. Focus on identifying who provided testimony in this case and cross-reference with any testimony that also helped convict other gang leaders from the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang. Search for keywords including '1933 jailbreak John Dillinger fake credentials', 'Harry Pierpont sheriff death conviction', 'Lima Ohio jail break 1933', 'Dillinger escape plan testimony', and 'witness testimony Pierpont conviction'.

**Use Cases**:
- Legal case preparation for defense attorneys researching witness testimony and trial records from the 1933 Dillinger jailbreak to identify procedural errors or new exculpatory evidence.
- Academic criminal history analysis for a university professor compiling and categorizing primary sources on Harry Pierpont‚Äôs conviction and related gang trials for a peer-reviewed journal article.
- True-crime journalism deep dive to automate aggregation of newspaper archives, court transcripts, and eyewitness accounts around the Lima, Ohio jailbreak and sheriff‚Äôs death for an investigative series.
- Museum exhibit content curation to source and verify authentic trial documents, testimonies, and photos for an interactive Prohibition-era crime display on John Dillinger and his associates.
- Genealogy and family-history research for descendants tracing ancestral connections to the Pierpont-Bridgewater-Northern gang through court records and witness lists from 1933.
- Digital archiving and preservation for a historical society automating the discovery and categorization of scanned legal filings, trial transcripts, and newspaper clippings relating to the sheriff‚Äôs shooting.
- Law-enforcement training module development to build detailed case studies on investigative techniques, fake credentials methods, and witness testimony cross-referencing used in the Pierpont trial for modern detective academies.

### Development Step 9: Identify Legume Wikipedia 2022 Content Violations and ‚ÄòR‚Äô Definition in Core Policies

**Description**: Search for information about the Legume Wikipedia page and identify what content violations occurred in its public logs during 2022 before December. Focus on finding the specific type of content that was violated and the associated three core policies, particularly identifying what 'R' stands for in those policies.

**Use Cases**:
- Wikipedia editorial oversight: scanning the Legume article‚Äôs public edit logs to detect instances of biased language (NPOV breaches), unverifiable claims (V), and original research (NOR) in edits made throughout 2022 before December, and producing policy-compliance reports.
- Corporate technical documentation audit: analyzing the revision history of an internal engineering wiki to flag unverified design claims and undocumented research insertions, ensuring all technical content meets the company's reliability standards akin to Reliable Sources.
- Social media content policy enforcement: processing comment and post logs on an online community forum to automatically identify and categorize policy infractions‚Äîsuch as defamation, hate speech, or false statements‚Äîmapping them to core policy codes (e.g., V for Verifiability, NOR for No Original Research) for the moderation team.
- Academic research integrity checks: reviewing student thesis draft revisions on a university‚Äôs digital submission portal to uncover any uncited original research (NOR violations) and confirm all assertions are supported by reliable, peer-reviewed sources (RS).
- Newswire fact-checking automation: ingesting document change logs from a news agency‚Äôs content management system to isolate and report additions lacking credible references or containing editorial bias, tagging violations under corresponding core policies and alerting editors in real time.
- E-commerce product description validation: examining change logs in a marketplace platform where sellers update product information, detecting unverifiable claims (V) or overhyped, unsupported details, and enforcing a neutral, research-backed standard before listing goes live.
- Government policy document review: parsing the version history of municipal policy drafts on an open-data portal to identify any introduction of original analysis or shifts in neutral language (NPOV, NOR violations), and summarizing findings for legal compliance and public transparency teams.

### Development Step 16: Identify 2002 regime-change measure repealed in 2023, co-sponsored by Cox, and Sessions‚Äô 2005 speech venue.

**Description**: Research the 2002 legislation that was repealed by the U.S. Senate in 2023, had unresolved House legislative status, was co-sponsored by Christopher Cox, aimed to support regime change through opposition groups, and targeted a certain leader. Identify this specific measure that Jeff Sessions spoke in favor of, then determine where he delivered a speech about this legislation in 2005.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated regulatory compliance tracking for a law firm: nightly scraping of congressional websites to identify new authorizations or repeals (like H.J.Res. 114) and update client policy dashboards.
- Investigative journalism timeline builder: real-time extraction of bill metadata and speech venues to map out when and where key lawmakers (e.g., Jeff Sessions) advocated for regime-change resolutions.
- Political science research data aggregator: batch download and clean legislative texts and co-sponsorship records (Christopher Cox et al.) for statistical analysis of voting patterns over time.
- Nonprofit advocacy communications: automated monitoring of AUMF repeal efforts and opponent group support clauses to craft targeted email alerts and policy briefs.
- Government archival automation: scheduled scraping and JSON-based storage of congressional resolutions, vote outcomes, and speech transcripts for public records portals.
- Legal tech knowledge-graph builder: parse cleaned legislative and speech-venue data to populate an AI-driven Q&A system for attorneys researching foreign-policy authorizations.
- University course content generator: assemble case-study materials (legislation history, sponsor networks, speech contexts) for political science or international relations syllabi.
