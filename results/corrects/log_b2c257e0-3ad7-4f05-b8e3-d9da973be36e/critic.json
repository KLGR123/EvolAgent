  "reason": "Task analysis: Calculate percentage difference between ice cream product's butterfat content and US federal standards using Wikipedia 2020 data, expressed as +/- number rounded to one decimal place. All three members successfully analyzed the attached image (data/gaia/2023/validation/b2c257e0-3ad7-4f05-b8e3-d9da973be36e.jpg) and extracted identical nutritional data: 21g total fat per 144g serving = 14.6% total fat by weight. All members correctly researched Wikipedia 2020 sources and identified the US federal minimum butterfat standard as 10% (FDA requirement). Member evaluation: Member 1 demonstrated most comprehensive methodology with systematic constraint mapping, complete documentation, and rigorous validation checks throughout each step. Member 2 used conservative estimation approach (75% dairy fat ratio) yielding 10.9% butterfat estimate, resulting in +9.4% difference - methodologically sound but unnecessarily complex given available data. Member 3 applied direct comparison using total fat content (14.6%) against federal standard (10%), yielding +4.6% difference - appropriately straightforward approach. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on core data extraction and federal standard identification, with divergence only in calculation methodology. Critical assessment: The most accurate approach treats the 14.6% total fat content as representative of butterfat content, as ice cream's primary fat source is milk fat from cream and skim milk (confirmed by ingredient analysis). Member 2's estimation method, while conservative, introduces unnecessary complexity and potential error. Final validation: 14.6% - 10.0% = +4.6 percentage points above federal standard, properly rounded to one decimal place as specified.",
