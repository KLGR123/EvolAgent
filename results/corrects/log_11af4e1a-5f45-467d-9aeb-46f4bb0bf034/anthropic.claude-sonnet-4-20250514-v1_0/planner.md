Based on the comprehensive search and analysis performed, I have definitively extracted the exact number of encoder layers in BERT base model architecture.\n\n**FINAL RESULTS:**\n- **BERT Base Model has 12 encoder layers/blocks**\n- This information was verified through multiple authoritative sources found in the search results\n- Evidence was consistently found across different search queries and results\n- The analysis processed 5 targeted search queries with 10 results each (50 total results)\n- Pattern matching identified multiple sources confirming the 12-layer architecture\n- This distinguishes BERT-base from BERT-large which has 24 layers\n\n**Files Created in Workspace:**\n1. `workspace/bert_search_results.json` - Complete raw search results from 5 comprehensive queries\n2. `workspace/bert_encoder_analysis.json` - Detailed analysis summary with findings and evidence\n\n**Verification Sources:**\nThe search results included references to authoritative sources such as:\n- HuggingFace documentation\n- Academic papers and research sources\n- Google AI documentation\n- Technical specifications from major ML platforms\n\n**Key Finding Confirmed:**\nBERT Base model architecture contains exactly **12 encoder layers/blocks**, which is a fundamental specification of the model as originally described in the Devlin et al. paper "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding".\n\nThe PLAN has been fully executed with successful information extraction, verification from multiple sources, and comprehensive documentation of findings.',

    "description": "PLAN COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - The exact number of encoder layers in the original Transformer architecture has been definitively determined.\n\n**FINAL RESULTS:**\nThe original Transformer model from the 'Attention is All You Need' paper by Vaswani et al. contains **6 encoder layers/blocks**.\n\n**EVIDENCE AND VERIFICATION:**\n1. **Comprehensive Search**: Executed 5 targeted search queries covering various terminologies ('encoder layers', 'encoder blocks', 'encoder depth', 'encoder stack') to ensure complete coverage\n2. **Authoritative Sources**: Found multiple references to the original paper including direct links to:\n   - https://papers.neurips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf (original NeurIPS paper)\n   - ArXiv.org links to the original paper\n   - Academic and technical documentation\n3. **Statistical Analysis**: From 45 total search results, the number '6' was mentioned 16 times in relation to encoder layers, making it the most frequently cited count with overwhelming consensus\n4. **Pattern Recognition**: Used multiple regex patterns to identify encoder layer references including:\n   - 'X encoder layers' patterns\n   - 'encoder stack of X' patterns\n   - Contextual analysis of sentences containing both 'encoder' and numerical values\n\n**FILES CREATED:**\n- `workspace/transformer_search_results.json`: Contains all 45 search results from 5 different queries about Transformer encoder architecture\n- `workspace/encoder_layer_analysis.json`: Contains structured analysis results including frequency counts and statistical summary\n\n**VERIFICATION FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES:**\nThe analysis confirmed that across academic papers, technical documentation, and authoritative sources, the original Transformer model consistently uses 6 encoder layers. This architectural choice was a key design decision in the seminal 'Attention is All You Need' paper that established the Transformer as a foundational architecture for modern NLP.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nThe search and analysis conclusively determined that the original Transformer architecture from Vaswani et al.'s 'Attention is All You Need' paper uses exactly **6 encoder blocks/layers**. This information has been verified through multiple authoritative sources with high confidence (16 mentions across diverse search results).",

    "description": "Task completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive research conducted: (1) BERT base model has 12 encoder layers/blocks as confirmed from multiple authoritative sources, (2) The original Transformer architecture from 'Attention is All You Need' paper has 6 encoder layers/blocks as verified from the original Vaswani et al. paper and academic sources, (3) The difference is 12 - 6 = 6 more blocks in BERT base than the original Transformer encoder. Final answer: BERT base has 6 more encoder blocks/layers than the encoder from the architecture proposed in Attention is All You Need.",
