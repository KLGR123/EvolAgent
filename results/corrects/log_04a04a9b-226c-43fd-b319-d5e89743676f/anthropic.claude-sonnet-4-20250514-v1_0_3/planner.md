## Task Description
```
If we assume all articles published by Nature in 2020 (articles, only, not book reviews/columns, etc) relied on statistical significance to justify their findings and they on average came to a p-value of 0.04, how many papers would be incorrect as to their claims of statistical significance? Round the value up to the next integer.

### Absolute Difference in Tens of Thousands Between 2018 and 2020 Chinstrap Penguin Populations

**TASK**: What is the absolute difference in tens of thousands between the population of chinstrap penguins on the Wikipedia page for penguin species populations as of the end of 2018 and the population recorded in the Nature.com "global population assessment of the Chinstrap penguin" article from 2020, assuming two penguins per breeding pair?

The PLAN required searching for and accessing Wikipedia pages about penguin species populations to locate specific chinstrap penguin population data as of the end of 2018, extract the population figure with measurement type clarification, and document the exact source and context.\n\nCOMPLETE RESULTS ACHIEVED:\n\n**Population Figure Found**: 8 million specimens (individual penguins, not breeding pairs)\n\n**Source**: IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), 2018\n\n**Exact Quote**: "In 2018, the IUCN estimated that the population of chinstrap penguins was around 8 million specimens."\n\n**Source Context**: \n- Wikipedia page: "Chinstrap penguin" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinstrap_penguin)\n- Section: Conservation status\n- Full context: The quote continues to note that while the population is believed to be decreasing overall, it\'s not severely fragmented and is increasing or stable in many sites. The species is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List.\n\n**Measurement Type Confirmation**: The data explicitly states "specimens" indicating individual penguins rather than breeding pairs, which directly addresses the PLAN requirement to note whether the figure represents breeding pairs or individual penguins.\n\n**Research Process Summary**:\n1. Conducted systematic Google searches targeting Wikipedia pages with chinstrap penguin population data\n2. Identified 39 total search results across 4 targeted queries\n3. Located the primary Wikipedia page "Chinstrap penguin" containing the target information\n4. Fetched and parsed the HTML content using multiple extraction methods\n5. Applied regex pattern matching to isolate the specific 2018 IUCN population statement\n6. Verified the data through conservation status section analysis\n7. Compiled comprehensive documentation with full source attribution\n\n**Files Created**:\n- workspace/chinstrap_penguin_search_results.json (search data)\n- workspace/chinstrap_penguin_population_extraction.json (extraction results)\n- workspace/chinstrap_penguin_final_answer.json (complete final answer)\n- workspace/chinstrap_penguin.html (source Wikipedia page)\n- workspace/list_of_sphenisciformes_by_population.html (supporting page)\n\n**Confidence Level**: High - The information was extracted from an authoritative source (IUCN via Wikipedia) with clear 2018 attribution, specific numerical data, and explicit measurement type clarification.

### Fact-Checking Greetham Citation: Verifying Quoted Passage from ‘Uncoupled’ Article

**TASK**: I need to fact-check a citation. This is the citation from the bibliography:

Greetham, David. "Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)." Textual Cultures: Texts, Contexts, Interpretation, vol. 3 no. 1, 2008, p. 45-46. Project MUSE, doi:10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44.

And this is the in-line citation:

Our relationship with the authors of the works we read can often be “obscured not by a "cloak of print" but by the veil of scribal confusion and mis-transmission” (Greetham 45-46).

Does the quoted text match what is actually in the article? If Yes, answer Yes, otherwise, give me the word in my citation that does not match with the correct one (without any article).
