### Find minimum cell towers to cover all houses within 4-mile road radius.

**TASK**: You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. In the reference file is a layout of the road and nearby houses. Each dash, "-", is a marker indicating a mile. Each capital H indicates a house located next to a mile marker, appearing above or below the stretch of road. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value. Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt
