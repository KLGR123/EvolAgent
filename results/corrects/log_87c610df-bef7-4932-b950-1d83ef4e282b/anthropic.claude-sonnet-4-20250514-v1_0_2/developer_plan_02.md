## Plan Content
```
Research who was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977, since India has been identified as the first place mentioned by name in the Book of Esther (NIV translation).
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal next step because: (1) We have successfully identified India as the first place mentioned by name in the Book of Esther NIV translation from the previous research, (2) The HISTORY shows this foundational work is complete, (3) Expected outcome is to determine India's Prime Minister during the specific timeframe of April 1977, (4) This directly completes the second part of the TASK requirement to identify who held this leadership position at that exact time.

    "description": "This code researches who was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977. I'm implementing a multi-source approach: (1) Attempting to scrape Wikipedia's list of Prime Ministers of India to find information about 1977, (2) Specifically looking up Morarji Desai's Wikipedia page since he was the PM during that time, (3) Using reliable historical knowledge as a fallback. The code searches for relevant content containing '1977' and 'Prime Minister' keywords, extracts biographical data from infoboxes, and compiles comprehensive research results. Based on historical records, Morarji Desai was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977, having taken office on March 24, 1977, after the Janata Party's victory following the Emergency period. The results will be saved to workspace/india_prime_minister_april_1977.json for further reference.",

The research successfully identified Morarji Desai as the Prime Minister of India in April 1977, with comprehensive verification from multiple Wikipedia sources. The code retrieved detailed information from both the List of Prime Ministers of India page and Morarji Desai's dedicated Wikipedia page, confirming his term from March 24, 1977 to July 28, 1979. Key findings include his party affiliation (Janata Party), age (81), and historical context (post-Emergency period). The output provides a clear answer with supporting details and verification data. Results were properly saved to 'workspace/india_prime_minister_april_1977.json' for future reference. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the research question has been thoroughly answered with verified historical data.
