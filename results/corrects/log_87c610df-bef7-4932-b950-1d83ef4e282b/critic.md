## Final Answer
```
Morarji Desai
```

## Reasoning
```
Task decomposition: This question required (1) identifying the first place mentioned in Book of Esther (NIV) and (2) determining its Prime Minister in April 1977. All team members independently followed the same logical approach. For sub-task 1, each member correctly accessed the NIV Bible text and systematically analyzed it to identify India as the first place mentioned, appearing in Esther 1:1 ('...provinces stretching from India to Cush'). This finding was consistent across all analyses with position verification (around position 125 in text). For sub-task 2, all members researched Indian political history for April 1977, confirming Morarji Desai was Prime Minister. Their findings consistently showed he took office on March 24, 1977, following the Janata Party's victory in elections after the Emergency period. Cross-analysis shows perfect convergence on both the identified location (India) and Prime Minister (Morarji Desai), with identical contextual details including the March 24, 1977 inauguration date and preceding Prime Minister (Indira Gandhi). All members provided comprehensive documentation with multiple verification sources. Member 2 offered slightly more detailed historical context, noting this was the first non-Congress government since independence. Final validation confirms Morarji Desai as the definitive answer with high confidence based on consistent findings across three independent research approaches.
