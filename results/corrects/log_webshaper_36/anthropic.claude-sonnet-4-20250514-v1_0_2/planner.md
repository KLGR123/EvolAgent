The search and analysis phase involved 12 comprehensive web search queries that returned 134 results, which were systematically categorized and analyzed. The definitive conclusion is that NO EVIDENCE EXISTS of Crawley Town donating replica kits to Italian football clubs. The analysis revealed that the famous 1903 kit donation story actually involves Notts County FC (NOT Crawley Town) donating black and white striped kits to Juventus FC via English player John Savage because Juventus' pink shirts were fading in the wash. Crawley Town's only Italian connection is a modern commercial partnership with Erreà (Italian sportswear manufacturer) for their current kits, which is a business relationship established in recent years, not a historical kit donation. The search results were categorized into: 25 Juventus-Notts County historical references, 15 Crawley-Erreà partnership results, 9 high relevance results, 19 historical 1903 references, and only 1 kit donation reference (unrelated to Italy).

    "description": 'This search is necessary because: (1) The HISTORY shows Harry Kewell was the first Australian manager at Crawley Town (18 wins), but Crawley Town has no Italian kit connection, (2) The Italian kit story involves Notts County donating to Juventus in 1903, creating a mismatch in the TASK requirements, (3) Expected outcome is to identify if there was an Australian manager at Notts County or another English club with actual Italian connections, (4) This will resolve whether the TASK refers to a different Australian manager-English club combination that matches both criteria, or if we need to reconsider the interpretation of the complex clues in the TASK',

    "description": "PLAN OBJECTIVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED: Harry Kewell's complete managerial record at Notts County has been definitively established through comprehensive search and analysis. The final results show that Harry Kewell won 3 games out of 14 total matches during his managerial tenure from 31 August 2018 to 13 November 2018. This represents a 21.4% win rate with 0.87 points per game. The complete record includes 3 wins, 4 draws, and 7 losses, with Kewell being sacked due to poor results while the team was in 22nd place. Multiple authoritative sources confirmed these statistics: (1) BBC Sport stating 'won just three of his 14 games in charge in all competitions', (2) The Guardian reporting 'win just three out of 14 matches under his management', and (3) Wikipedia's List of Notts County F.C. managers showing the detailed data sequence '31 August 2018, 13 November 2018, 74, 14, 3, 4, 7, 021.43' which confirms 14 games and 3 wins. The comprehensive managerial record has been saved to workspace/harry_kewell_notts_county_definitive_record.json with all supporting evidence and source documentation.
