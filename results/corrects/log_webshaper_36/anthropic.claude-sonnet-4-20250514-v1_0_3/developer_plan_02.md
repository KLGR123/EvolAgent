# Developer Plan #2 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** webshaper_36  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 2  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-09 14:56:28

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about Harry Kewell's managerial record at Crawley Town, focusing on his win-loss statistics during his tenure from May 2017. Look for comprehensive match records, seasonal performance data, and official statistics from his time as head coach. Search for keywords including 'Harry Kewell Crawley Town wins record', 'Kewell manager statistics Crawley', 'Harry Kewell Crawley Town tenure results', and 'Crawley Town 2017-2018 season Harry Kewell'. Focus on identifying the total number of games won during his complete managerial period at the club.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have identified Harry Kewell as the first Australian manager of a professional English club (Crawley Town), (2) We need to find his specific win record during his tenure to answer the core question, (3) Expected outcome is to obtain official match statistics showing total wins under his management, (4) This will provide the numerical answer required by the TASK once we also verify the Italian club connection through replica kits

### Development Step 1: Comprehensive Search for J.K. Rowling Books Published by Bloomsbury with Full Publication Details

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about books written by J.K. Rowling and published by Bloomsbury. Use multiple search approaches: (1) Direct search for 'J.K. Rowling Bloomsbury published books', (2) Search specifically for Harry Potter series publication details, (3) Look for J.K. Rowling bibliography with publisher information, (4) Check Bloomsbury's official website or catalog for J.K. Rowling titles. Focus on identifying all books that match both criteria (author: J.K. Rowling, publisher: Bloomsbury) and compile a complete list with publication dates and details.

**Use Cases**:
- Academic bibliometric research: compiling a dataset of J.K. Rowling’s Bloomsbury-published works with publication dates and metadata for a journal article on authorial output trends
- Independent bookstore inventory automation: pulling precise Bloomsbury edition details of all J.K. Rowling titles to update stock listings, reorder thresholds, and display promotional timelines
- Literary rights management: tracking and dating every J.K. Rowling book published by Bloomsbury to prepare licensing proposals, contract renewals, and subsidiary rights audits
- Content marketing and SEO optimization: generating an evergreen “timeline of J.K. Rowling’s Bloomsbury releases” blog post with accurate titles, release dates, and edition highlights for increased search visibility
- Mobile app data integration: populating a reader’s companion app with complete title lists, cover images, and publication info for J.K. Rowling’s Bloomsbury catalog to support reading trackers and notifications
- Entertainment journalism fact-checking: extracting publisher-specific details on each J.K. Rowling book from Bloomsbury to verify release timelines and edition history for a magazine feature
- University library catalog enhancement: enriching OPAC records and MARC entries with up-to-date Bloomsbury publication data for J.K. Rowling’s bibliography to improve discoverability and acquisition planning

This is the first development step focusing on data collection through multiple targeted search approaches: (1) Direct search for Harry Kewell's wins record at Crawley Town, (2) Search for his managerial statistics and tenure results from 2017, (3) Search specifically for his tenure results starting from May 2017, and (4) Search for Crawley Town's 2017-2018 season results under Kewell. Each search uses specific keywords to maximize the chance of finding comprehensive match records, seasonal performance data, and official statistics. The code includes detailed progress reporting through print statements and saves all raw search results to workspace/harry_kewell_crawley_search_results.json for subsequent analysis.

    "description": "This code performs comprehensive analysis of the search results to extract Harry Kewell's specific win statistics at Crawley Town. Building on the successful file structure inspection, it now processes all organic results from the 4 search categories to identify and extract numerical data about his managerial record. The code uses multiple regex patterns to match various formats of statistical information (wins, games, win percentage, tenure dates) and focuses specifically on Crawley Town-related content. It systematically examines each snippet for key statistics like '18 wins in 57 games' and '31.6% win rate' that were mentioned in the tester feedback. The analysis categorizes findings by search type, extracts the most detailed records, and saves comprehensive results to workspace for reference. This approach ensures we capture all available statistical information about Harry Kewell's win record during his complete managerial period at Crawley Town from May 2017 to August 2018.",

    "description": "Fixed the variable scope issue by restructuring the analysis logic to avoid using generator expressions with variables defined in different scopes. This code performs comprehensive analysis of Harry Kewell's Crawley Town managerial statistics by processing all search results systematically. It extracts key statistical information including wins, games played, win percentages, and tenure details. The analysis specifically targets the information mentioned in the tester feedback: Harry Kewell managed Crawley Town from May 23, 2017 to August 31, 2018, achieving 18 wins in 57 games (31.6% win rate) and leading the team to a 14th place finish in League Two. The code uses multiple regex patterns to identify various statistical formats, filters for Crawley-related content, and saves comprehensive analysis results to workspace. This addresses the PLAN objective to identify the total number of games won (18 wins) during Harry Kewell's complete managerial period at Crawley Town.",
