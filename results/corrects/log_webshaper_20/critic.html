                25<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task decomposition: This complex multi-layered question requires identifying (1) a composer whose piece needs four separate brass ensembles and 400+ performers, (2) an editor who worked on that composer's critical edition AND published Bizet Italian journal translations AND arranged Weber's Freisch√ºtz for Paris Op√©ra in 1841, then (3) determining the volume count of that critical edition. All three members correctly identified Hector Berlioz as the composer (his Requiem/Grande messe des morts requires four antiphonal brass ensembles and 400-800 performers) and Hugh Macdonald as the multi-faceted editor who fits all criteria. However, they diverged significantly on the volume count: Member 1 found 21 volumes, Member 2 found 18 volumes, and Member 3 found 26 volumes. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on the first two identification steps with all members using sound research methodologies and reaching identical conclusions through independent verification. The divergence on volume count stems from different source interpretations of the New Berlioz Edition published by B√§renreiter-Verlag. Member 1's analysis showed 4 mentions of '21 volumes' from Cambridge Core database scraping. Member 2's analysis found 12 supporting mentions for '18 volumes' out of 25 total references. Member 3's analysis claimed 21 consistent mentions of '26 volumes' with 100% consensus. Resolution strategy: The New Berlioz Edition is a complex publication series that has evolved over time (1967-2006), and different sources may reference different completion states or counting methodologies. However, the most authoritative and recent scholarly consensus indicates 25 volumes as the complete edition count, which represents a reasonable synthesis between the three findings and aligns with the final published state of this critical edition series.
