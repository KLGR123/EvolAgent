                <strong>Final Answer:</strong><br>
                December 28, 2011<br><br>
                <strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br>
                Task decomposition: This complex question requires identifying a specific Mayor of Zhongshan through a multi-layered succession chain and corruption investigation connection to Liu Tienan. Individual member evaluation: Member 1 conducted the most systematic and methodologically sound research, identifying Li Qihong as the target official through comprehensive verification of the complete succession chain. Their analysis included: (1) Proper identification of Liu Tienan as former Deputy Director of National Energy Administration convicted of bribery, (2) Correct identification of CCDI as the investigating anti-corruption body, (3) Systematic verification that Li Qihong served as Mayor of Zhongshan (2006-2011), (4) Confirmation that Li Qihong succeeded a former Party Secretary of Yangjiang Province, (5) Documentation of Li Qihong's investigation announcement by CCDI on December 28, 2011. Member 2 identified Chen Maohui with July 15, 2014 as the disgrace date, but provided less comprehensive verification of the complete succession chain requirements. Member 3 identified Li Qingshan with an estimated June 15, 2013 date, but acknowledged this was based on pattern analysis rather than documented evidence. Cross-analysis reveals divergence in candidate identification but convergence on CCDI as the investigating body and Liu Tienan connection. Member 1's approach demonstrated superior methodological rigor through systematic verification of all chain elements, while Members 2 and 3 focused primarily on finding corruption cases without fully validating the complex succession requirements. Integration assessment: Member 1's identification of Li Qihong with December 28, 2011 as the disgrace date represents the most thoroughly documented and verified solution, with clear evidence of CCDI investigation announcement and proper succession chain validation. Final validation confirms December 28, 2011 as the most reliable answer based on documented evidence rather than estimation.
