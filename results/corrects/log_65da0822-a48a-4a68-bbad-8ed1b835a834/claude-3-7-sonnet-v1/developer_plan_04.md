# Developer Plan #4 - claude-3-7-sonnet-v1

**Task ID:** 65da0822-a48a-4a68-bbad-8ed1b835a834  
**Model:** claude-3-7-sonnet-v1  
**Plan Index:** 4  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-30 16:53:17

## Plan Content
```
Determine the cities where the westernmost university (Santa Clara University) and easternmost university (University of Massachusetts Boston) identified in our research are located. Create a comma-separated list with the westernmost city listed first, followed by the easternmost city.
```

## Plan Description
```
This step is necessary because: (1) We've already identified Santa Clara University as the westernmost university and University of Massachusetts Boston as the easternmost university from previous research, (2) The HISTORY shows we have their coordinates but need to explicitly identify their city locations, (3) Expected outcome is the names of the cities where these universities are located, (4) The TASK specifically requests a comma-separated list of city names rather than university names, with westernmost first.

    "description": 'This script implements a data-driven approach to determine the westernmost and easternmost university cities. Rather than relying solely on hardcoded values, it analyzes longitude data from the CSV file to objectively determine which university is furthest west (smallest/most negative longitude value) and furthest east (largest/least negative longitude value).\n\nThe implementation:\n\n1. Reads the university data from the secretary_universities.csv file found in the workspace directory\n2. Extracts each university\'s name, location, and most importantly, longitude values\n3. Parses the city name from the location field (which follows a "City, State" format)\n4. Sorts the universities by longitude value to determine westernmost (smallest longitude) and easternmost (largest longitude)\n5. Uses the cities determined through data analysis to create the comma-separated list with westernmost city first\n6. Includes fallback to default values if data cannot be properly accessed or analyzed\n7. Provides detailed logging of the process and findings\n8. Saves the final comma-separated result to workspace/university_cities.txt\n\nThis approach is more robust than previous versions because it uses actual geographical coordinates (longitude values) to determine east/west positioning rather than relying on assumptions or hardcoded values.
