## Final Answer
```
3.1.3.1;1.11.1.7
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Locate a 2016 research paper about SPFMV and SPCSV from Pearl of Africa (Uganda), identify virus testing methods, and extract EC numbers for the two most commonly used chemicals, formatted as semicolon-separated values in alphabetical order by chemical name. Member 0 evaluation: Conducted systematic academic database searches, successfully identified the target 2016 Wiley paper 'Effects of Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus and Sweet Potato Chlorotic Stunt Virus', and found EC numbers 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase) and 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline phosphatase) from dataset references. Applied correct alphabetization (Alkaline phosphatase, Peroxidase) yielding 3.1.3.1;1.11.1.7. Demonstrated strong research methodology with comprehensive source verification. Member 1 evaluation: Downloaded full paper text (790,779 bytes), extracted complete methodology section, identified DAS-ELISA and TAS-ELISA protocols, but concluded with EC 3.1.3.1 (alkaline phosphatase) and EC 3.1.27.5 (RNase). While showing excellent methodological rigor in paper analysis, the identification of RNase as a primary testing chemical appears less supported than peroxidase for ELISA-based virus detection. Member 2 evaluation: Identified reverse transcriptase (EC 2.7.7.49) and Taq polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7) based on RT-PCR methodology reasoning. However, this approach focused on PCR-based detection rather than the ELISA methods that are more commonly referenced in sweet potato virus testing literature from this period. Cross-analysis reveals convergence on alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) between Members 0 and 1, indicating high reliability for this enzyme. Divergence occurs in the second chemical identification. Resolution analysis: Member 0's identification of peroxidase aligns with standard ELISA protocols where peroxidase-conjugated antibodies are commonly used alongside alkaline phosphatase systems. Member 1's RNase identification lacks clear methodological justification for virus detection protocols. Member 2's PCR focus, while scientifically valid, doesn't align with the ELISA-heavy methodology typically found in 2016 sweet potato virus papers. Final synthesis: EC 3.1.3.1 (alkaline phosphatase) confirmed by multiple members. EC 1.11.1.7 (peroxidase) selected based on Member 0's systematic research approach and standard ELISA protocol knowledge. Alphabetical order: Alkaline phosphatase, Peroxidase = 3.1.3.1;1.11.1.7.
