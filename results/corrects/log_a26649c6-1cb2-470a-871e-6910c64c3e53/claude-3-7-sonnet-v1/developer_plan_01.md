# Developer Plan #1 - claude-3-7-sonnet-v1

**Task ID:** a26649c6-1cb2-470a-871e-6910c64c3e53  
**Model:** claude-3-7-sonnet-v1  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-30 07:56:39

## Plan Content
```
Search for the Wikipedia page on penguin species populations and extract information about the chinstrap penguin population as recorded at the end of 2018. Focus on finding the specific population number for chinstrap penguins mentioned on the Wikipedia page.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to gather the first data point - the chinstrap penguin population from Wikipedia as of end of 2018, (2) No previous research has been conducted on either source, (3) Expected outcome is to locate and extract the specific population number for chinstrap penguins from Wikipedia, (4) This establishes the first value needed for calculating the absolute difference requested in the task.

    "description": "This code implements a comprehensive strategy to find information about the chinstrap penguin population as of 2018 from Wikipedia. The approach includes:\n\n1. First, it attempts to retrieve and parse the Wikipedia page specifically about chinstrap penguins\n2. It searches for population information using multiple methods:\n   - Looking for sections with population-related keywords\n   - Searching for paragraphs mentioning population data and the year 2018\n   - Examining tables that might contain population statistics\n\n3. If the specific chinstrap penguin page doesn't yield results, the code broadens the search to:\n   - The general Wikipedia page about penguins\n   - Using Wikipedia's search functionality to find other relevant pages\n   - Checking up to 3 search results that might contain the needed information\n\n4. For each potential source, it extracts sentences mentioning both chinstrap penguins, population data, and the year 2018, then uses regex patterns to identify potential population numbers.\n\n5. All findings are saved to workspace files for inspection:\n   - HTML content of relevant pages\n   - A structured JSON summary of potential population mentions\n\nThe code provides verbose output during execution to make the search process transparent and allow for troubleshooting. If the population information is found, it will be displayed with its context and source. If not, the code acknowledges the limitation and suggests the information may require additional sources beyond Wikipedia.",
