## Task Description
```
I have the Standard plan in the image below, and I just uploaded 60 equally sized files and got a message that I'm 100GB over the limit. I have 980 more files of the same size to upload. What is the average additional cost per file in dollar that goes over my current plan limit rounded to the nearest cent if I have to upgrade to the minimum possible plan to store them all? Answer with the following format: x.xx Attached local file(s): data/gaia/2023/validation/d8152ad6-e4d5-4c12-8bb7-8d57dc10c6de.png
