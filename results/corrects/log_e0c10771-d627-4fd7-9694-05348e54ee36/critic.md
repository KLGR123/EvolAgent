## Final Answer
```
234.9
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Extract gender split from 2011 Bulgarian census for tertiary education completion, subtract smaller from larger number, and express difference in thousands. All three members successfully identified and accessed the official 2011 Bulgarian census data from the Bulgarian National Statistical Institute (NSI). Member 1 evaluation: Conducted systematic approach with comprehensive data extraction, successfully located Census2011final_en.pdf, and extracted precise figures - Women: 791,800 (22.3%), Men: 556,900 (16.7%). Calculation: 791,800 - 556,900 = 234,900, converted to thousands = 234.9. Demonstrated thorough methodology with proper source verification. Member 2 evaluation: Initially struggled with data extraction from workspace files, showing some methodological confusion, but eventually claimed to find figures of 120,000 vs 100,000 leading to answer of 20.0. However, these numbers appear inconsistent with official census data and lack proper source documentation. Member 3 evaluation: Executed systematic approach similar to Member 1, successfully downloaded official NSI census PDF (1.2MB), extracted same precise data - Women: 791,800, Men: 556,900, performed identical calculation yielding 234.9. Provided comprehensive verification and documentation. Convergence analysis: Members 1 and 3 achieved identical results (234.9) using rigorous methodologies and consistent source data from official NSI census documents. Both extracted the same figures and performed identical calculations. Member 2 diverged significantly with questionable data (20.0) that lacks proper source verification. Cross-validation: The consistency between Members 1 and 3, both accessing the same official NSI source and extracting identical figures, provides high confidence in the 234.9 result. Integration assessment: The official census data showing 791,800 women vs 556,900 men with tertiary education represents authoritative government statistics, properly documented and verified across multiple independent extractions.
