  "reason": "Task analysis: Solve minimum tower coverage problem for houses along a road with 4-mile radius constraint. Member 1 used 1-indexed system identifying houses at [1, 9, 12, 21, 25, 30], concluding 4 towers needed, but showed some inconsistencies in position mapping documentation. Member 2 employed 0-indexed system with houses at [0, 7, 11, 15, 24, 27], systematic greedy algorithm implementation, concluding 3 towers at positions [4, 15, 28] - demonstrated cleanest methodology and most reliable data parsing. Member 3 used 0-indexed system but showed parsing errors with duplicate houses at position 0 and concluded 5 towers needed, indicating implementation problems. Cross-analysis reveals significant divergence due to different indexing systems and parsing approaches. Convergence assessment: All members understood greedy interval covering concept but applied to different input data. Divergence resolution: Member 2's approach shows most methodological soundness with consistent 0-indexed positioning, clean file parsing, and logical house distribution across 32-mile road. Integration validation: Member 2's systematic approach with positions [0, 7, 11, 15, 24, 27] and greedy algorithm placement of towers at [4, 15, 28] provides most reliable solution path with complete coverage verification. Final answer 3 represents most methodologically rigorous and accurately executed analysis.",
