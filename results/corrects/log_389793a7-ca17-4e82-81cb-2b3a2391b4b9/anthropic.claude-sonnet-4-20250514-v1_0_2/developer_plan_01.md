# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-28 18:13:48

## Plan Content
```
Parse and analyze the attached file data/gaia/2023/validation/389793a7-ca17-4e82-81cb-2b3a2391b4b9.txt to understand the road layout, identify all house positions, and map their locations relative to mile markers. Extract the visual representation showing dashes (-) as mile markers and H symbols as houses, then determine the coordinate system and calculate distances between houses and potential tower locations.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to understand the problem layout from the provided file before determining tower placement, (2) No previous analysis has been performed, (3) Expected outcome is to have a clear map of house positions and road structure, (4) This provides the foundation needed to solve the minimum tower coverage optimization problem
