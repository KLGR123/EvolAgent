**Task ID:** webshaper_34  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-08 17:44:56

## Plan Content
```
Search for information about the Distinctive International Arab Festivals Awards 2022 held in Dubai and sponsored by Algedra to identify which Pakistani actress received an award in a category that honors Pakistani actresses. Focus on finding the complete list of award recipients, categories, and specifically look for any Pakistani actress winners from this ceremony.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific Pakistani actress who won at this awards ceremony before we can research her other credentials, (2) No previous research has been conducted on this complex multi-part query, (3) Expected outcome is to find the awards ceremony details and identify the Pakistani actress recipient, (4) This establishes the foundation for subsequently verifying her debut in Six Sigma Entertainment's first Urdu drama series from 2012 and her lead role in the Ahsan Rahim film that earned over 500 million PKR

### Development Step 2: Post-1977 20th-Century Malko Competition Winners and Their Nationalities (Including Defunct States)

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Archiving and extracting grant awardees from a foundation’s online records (2000–2020) to analyze funding trends by recipient nationality
- Aggregating hackathon winner data from multiple tech event websites post-2015 for corporate sponsorship decision support
- Mining patent award information from USPTO HTML archives to map inventor nationalities and identify innovation hotspots
- Automating extraction of sanctioned entities from government PDF/HTML sanction lists to keep compliance databases up to date
- Building a music streaming service feature that compiles historical competition winners and their nationalities for curated playlists
- Parsing academic conference websites to index keynote speakers and their affiliations for university library catalogs
- Extracting sports tournament champions from archived sports federation pages to feed a real-time analytics dashboard for media outlets

### Development Step 3: Post-1977 20th-Century Malko Competition Winners: Names, Years, Nationalities (Including Defunct States)

**Description**: Search for comprehensive information about the Malko Competition, focusing on identifying all recipients from the 20th Century after 1977. Target these research approaches: (1) Official Malko Competition website or archives for complete winner lists, (2) Classical music databases and competition records, (3) Music journalism sources and historical archives, (4) Academic or institutional music resources. Extract complete recipient data including names, years of victory, and recorded nationalities. Pay special attention to nationalities that correspond to countries that no longer exist (such as USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.). Compile a systematic list of all post-1977 20th century winners with their nationality information for further analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated compilation of Malko Competition winners by nationality for a musicology research paper on post-1977 European conductor trends
- Cultural heritage data enrichment in a digital library to tag and cross-reference 20th-century competition laureates
- Historical geopolitical analysis of USSR and Yugoslavian artists for a Cold War-era performing arts exhibition catalogue
- University curriculum development tool that aggregates real-world competition results to build case studies in conducting courses
- Classical music streaming platform feature that auto-generates artist profiles with competition wins and former-country origins
- Grant-writing support system for arts foundations, pre-filling applicant profiles with past prize data sorted by year and historical nationality
- Automated archival metadata creation for national music archives, extracting structured winner records from public web sources

    "description": 'Starting Phase 1 of the search for Distinctive International Arab Festivals Awards 2022 information. This initial search targets the specific event held in Dubai and sponsored by Algedra, focusing on finding Pakistani actress award recipients. The approach uses a comprehensive search query combining all key terms: the award name, year, location, sponsor, and target demographic (Pakistani actress). The code performs a Google search via SerpAPI, analyzes results for relevance using keyword matching, and extracts potential actress names using regex patterns. Results are saved to workspace files for further analysis. The relevance scoring system prioritizes results containing both award-related terms and Pakistani actress-related terms, helping identify the most promising sources for detailed investigation in subsequent phases.',

    "feedback": "Execution partially successful - The code successfully made the API request and found 6 search results, but failed during result processing due to a variable name error. The search query executed correctly and data was retrieved, but the analysis phase encountered a NameError: 'combined_result_text' is not defined, which prevented processing of all 6 results. This appears to be a variable naming inconsistency in the result processing loop - the code defines 'combined_text' but tries to use 'combined_result_text'. **PLAN** alignment: 30% complete - search executed but no meaningful analysis of results was performed due to the processing error. Recommended fix: Change all instances of 'combined_result_text' to 'combined_text' in the result processing section to match the variable that was actually defined. The search results are likely saved to workspace files, so once the processing error is fixed, we should be able to analyze the retrieved data for Pakistani actress award winners.",

    "description": "Fixed the variable name error from Phase 1 and completed the analysis of search results for the Distinctive International Arab Festivals Awards 2022. The original code had a bug where it defined 'combined_text' but tried to use 'combined_result_text', causing processing failures. This corrected version first inspects the workspace file structure to understand the saved data, then processes all 6 search results with proper variable names. The analysis uses keyword matching to identify relevance (award terms + Pakistani terms), extracts potential actress names using regex patterns, and ranks results by relevance score. The code saves a corrected analysis file and identifies the most promising result for further investigation. This systematic approach ensures we can properly evaluate which search results contain information about Pakistani actress award winners from the Dubai ceremony sponsored by Algedra.",

The analysis processed all 14 search results and identified highly relevant findings that directly answer the **PLAN** objective. Key discovery: Maya Ali, a Pakistani actress, won the 'Pakistani Actress of the Year' award at the Distinctive International Arab Festivals Awards (DIAFA) 2022 held in Dubai. This information was found in multiple high-relevance results (scores 6-7) including official sources like the DIAFA honorees page, Instagram posts, and news articles. The code correctly identified 11 relevant results, extracted potential actress names, and saved comprehensive analysis to workspace files. **PLAN** alignment: 100% complete - the specific Pakistani actress award winner has been successfully identified along with the award category, event details, and location. The objective to find 'which Pakistani actress received an award in a category that honors Pakistani actresses' is fully answered: Maya Ali received the 'Pakistani Actress of the Year' award.
