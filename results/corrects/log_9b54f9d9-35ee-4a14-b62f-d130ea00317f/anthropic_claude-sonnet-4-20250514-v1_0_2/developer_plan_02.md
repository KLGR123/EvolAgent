# Developer Plan 02

## Plan
Parse and analyze the attached XML file data/gaia/2023/validation/9b54f9d9-35ee-4a14-b62f-d130ea00317f/CATEGORIES.xml to extract all text elements under the CATEGORIES section. Map each of the 10 foods identified as having no duplicates (fleur de sel, geoduck, granola, oat cereal, pickle, relish, salt, shish kebab, skewer, turtle soup) to their corresponding XML category elements. Since the task asks for 'the one food' but our analysis found 10 unique foods, examine the XML structure to determine if there's additional context that would narrow this down to a single food item, or identify which category element would contain each unique food.

## Description
This is the necessary next step because: (1) We have successfully identified 10 foods without duplicates from the Excel analysis, but the task assumes 'one food' exists, (2) We need to examine the XML categories structure to understand how foods map to category elements, (3) Expected outcome is to determine which XML category element(s) correspond to the unique food(s) and potentially resolve the discrepancy between expecting one unique food versus finding 10, (4) This will provide the final answer by connecting the spreadsheet analysis to the XML category structure as requested in the TASK

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 2: Extract and Categorize Fast-Food Menu Sales from Excel, Prepare Food-Only Sales Totals

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/7bd855d8-463d-4ed5-93ca-5fe35145f733.xlsx to extract all sales data for the fast-food chain menu items. Identify the structure of the spreadsheet including column headers, data organization, and categorize menu items to distinguish between food items and drinks. Extract sales figures for each item and prepare the data for calculating total food sales excluding beverages.

**Use Cases**:
- Multi-location franchise performance benchmarking: aggregate and compare food vs beverage sales across outlets to identify top-performing restaurants and underperforming regions
- Inventory procurement optimization for supply chain teams: parse POS export spreadsheets to compute accurate demand for burgers, salads, fries, etc., excluding beverages to streamline restocking orders
- Financial auditing and compliance reporting for hospitality accountants: automatically extract and categorize sales figures from daily sales logs to generate audit trails and tax reports focusing on taxable food items
- Menu engineering and dynamic pricing analysis for marketing managers: analyze historical sales volume per menu category to adjust pricing, promotions, and product placement for maximizing food item revenue excluding drinks
- Demand forecasting and supply planning for operations teams: ingest weekly Excel sales exports, aggregate item-level food sales excluding beverages, and feed into forecasting models for ingredient ordering
- Loyalty program ROI assessment for CRM platforms: extract item-level sales data by location to measure uplift in food purchases during targeted promotions or discount campaigns, excluding beverage sales
- Business intelligence dashboard integration for executive reporting: transform raw Excel sales data into structured JSON and text summaries for real-time ingestion into BI tools to visualize food-only revenue trends across all outlets
- Competitive benchmarking and market analysis for consultancy firms: use categorized sales data to compare menu performance against industry benchmarks and advise clients on menu mix optimization
