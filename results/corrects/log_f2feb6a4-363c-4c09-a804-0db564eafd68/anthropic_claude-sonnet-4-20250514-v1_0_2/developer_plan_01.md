# Developer Plan 01

## Plan
Search for recent home sales data for the two specific properties in Pearl City, Hawaii: 2072 Akaikai Loop and 2017 Komo Mai Drive. Focus on finding their 2022 sale prices through real estate databases, public records, or property websites like Zillow, Realtor.com, or Hawaii property records. Extract the exact sale prices for both properties to determine which sold for more and identify the higher sale amount.

## Description
This is the optimal first step because: (1) We need to locate specific property sale records for two addresses in Pearl City, Hawaii from 2022, (2) No previous research has been conducted on these properties, (3) Expected outcome is to find the 2022 sale prices for both 2072 Akaikai Loop and 2017 Komo Mai Drive, (4) This directly targets the core TASK requirement to compare the sale prices and identify which home sold for more and the exact amount

## Episodic Examples
### Development Step 4: Best Seahorse Island Family Pool House: Shelley's Place vs Unavailable Higher-Rated Rentals

**Description**: Based on the comprehensive analysis of the Seahorse Island accommodations PDF, compare the available full house rental options with swimming amenities to determine which property would be the better choice for a family. Evaluate the single available option (Shelley's Place) against the unavailable but higher-rated alternatives, and provide a clear recommendation considering factors like star ratings, swimming facilities, family-friendly features, and any potential concerns identified in the analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Family vacation rental recommendation automation using structured JSON analysis of PDF listings to compare swimming amenities, ratings, and availability
- Property management benchmarking tool that extracts amenity and rating data from accommodation PDFs to identify high-value full-house rentals for portfolio optimization
- Travel agency itinerary generator that prioritizes kid-friendly rentals with pools by evaluating guest reviews for safety, noise, and space considerations
- Hospitality platform content updater that parses vendor-supplied PDFs to refresh online listings with current swimming facility details and vacancy status
- Tourism analytics dashboard ingesting structured data to visualize seasonal availability of pool-equipped homes and track rating trends for strategy planning
- Hotel quality-control automation scanning guest reviews for creaking floors, noise issues, and accessibility concerns to flag properties for maintenance before family bookings
- Booking engine recommendation engine integration that balances real-time availability with user-defined criteria (pool access, star rating, privacy) for on-the-fly quotes
- Real estate investment analysis tool evaluating guest satisfaction metrics and amenity offerings from PDF extraction to guide development of new family-oriented rentals

### Development Step 2: Seahorse Island Full-House Rentals With Swimming Amenities, Family-Friendly Features, and Availability Status

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/366e2f2b-8632-4ef2-81eb-bc3877489217.pdf to extract information about all accommodations in Seahorse Island. Focus on identifying properties that offer full house rentals and have swimming amenities (pools, beach access, or water features). Extract details including accommodation names, property types, amenities, availability status, and any family-friendly features to enable comparison of options suitable for a family seeking a full house with swimming facilities.

**Use Cases**:
- Travel agency itinerary automation by parsing PDF catalogs of Seahorse Island lodgings to curate full-house rentals with pools and beach access for family vacation packages
- Vacation rental aggregator platform extracting detailed amenities and availability from island property PDF reports to dynamically update swim-friendly listings for parents planning trips
- Real estate investment analysis tool processing PDF accommodation data to evaluate full-house rentals with water features for ROI projections and portfolio diversification
- Local tourism board content management system summarizing PDF accommodation brochures to highlight family-oriented swim-enabled properties on official island visitor websites
- Property management CRM integration that ingests PDF booking and amenity details to automatically recommend available family-friendly houses with pools to repeat guests
- Hospitality market research solution scanning competitor PDF listings to identify gaps in full-house swim amenity offerings on Seahorse Island for strategic service expansion
- Insurance underwriting pre-screening process parsing PDF descriptions of rental houses with water features to assess property risk and streamline quote generation for seasonal policies

### Development Step 3: Comparing Seahorse Island Pool Rentals for Families: Shelley's Place vs Top-Rated Houses

**Description**: Based on the comprehensive analysis of the Seahorse Island accommodations PDF, compare the available full house rental options with swimming amenities to determine which property would be the better choice for a family. Evaluate the single available option (Shelley's Place) against the unavailable but higher-rated alternatives, and provide a clear recommendation considering factors like star ratings, swimming facilities, family-friendly features, and any potential concerns identified in the analysis.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated extraction and comparison of swimming amenities and star ratings from multiple resort PDF brochures to recommend the best family-friendly rental on Seahorse Island for a travel agency‚Äôs booking system
- Backend integration in a holiday rental platform that ingests property listing PDFs, parses JSON summaries of amenities, and flags unavailable but highly rated alternatives for customer upsell opportunities
- Data pipeline for a real estate analytics startup that scans regional vacation home brochures in PDF form, structures the details into JSON, and outputs a ranked list of family-oriented full-house rentals with pools
- Research tool for hospitality management scholars to batch-process accommodation catalogs, quantify amenity distributions (e.g., swimming pools), and analyze rating disparities between available and premium properties
- Internal audit automation in a hotel chain that reads facility and service summary PDFs, verifies compliance with family-safety standards around swimming areas, and generates a pass/fail report
- Tourism board dashboard that aggregates PDF listings of island properties, extracts key family-friendly features (star rating, pool size, kid zones), and visualizes a geographic heatmap of recommended rentals
- Feature enhancement for a mobile travel app that auto-imports PDF vacation guides, builds JSON property profiles, and presents users with a side-by-side recommendation highlighting the top pick for families on Seahorse Island

### Development Step 1: Extract Full-House Rentals with Swimming Amenities on Seahorse Island

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/366e2f2b-8632-4ef2-81eb-bc3877489217.pdf to extract information about all accommodations in Seahorse Island. Focus on identifying properties that offer full house rentals and have swimming amenities (pools, beach access, or water features). Extract details including accommodation names, property types, amenities, availability status, and any family-friendly features to enable comparison of options suitable for a family seeking a full house with swimming facilities.

**Use Cases**:
- Real estate agents consolidating Seahorse Island property PDFs to present families with full-house rentals that include private pools and beachfront access
- Vacation rental marketplaces automating ingestion of host-submitted PDF brochures to update listings of island villas with water features and real-time availability
- Travel agencies extracting family-friendly full-house options with swimming amenities from sealed PDF catalogs to craft customized holiday itineraries
- Hospitality consulting firms benchmarking pool-equipped full-house rentals on Seahorse Island by parsing competitor PDF offerings to identify amenity trends and pricing strategies
- Insurance underwriters assessing water-related risk factors in full-house accommodations on Seahorse Island by extracting property layouts and swimming amenity details from regulatory PDFs
- Local tourism boards generating interactive online guides by extracting names, availability, and amenity details of full-house rentals with pools from official PDF reports
- Event planners organizing offshore corporate retreats by automatically filtering PDF portfolios for large island rentals with beach access and private pools suitable for team-building

### Development Step 2: Find City with October 2019 Planning Permission for Homeless Shelter-to-Flats Conversion

**Description**: Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the city where a developer received planning permission in October 2019 to convert a homeless shelter into flats. Focus on searching for news articles, planning applications, and local government records from October 2019 using keywords like 'October 2019 planning permission homeless shelter flats conversion', 'homeless shelter converted flats October 2019', and 'planning permission shelter housing development 2019'. Cross-reference results with locations that have Bournemouth Seafront areas containing Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th century historic villas, and conservation areas designated in 1987.

**Use Cases**:
- Real estate investment due diligence: automatically extract and verify October 2019 planning permissions for property conversions (e.g., homeless shelter to flats) to assess redevelopment opportunities in Bournemouth and similar coastal towns
- Urban planning research and heritage conservation: cross-reference local government records with landmark datasets (Russell-Cotes Museum, East Cliff Lift, 19th-century villas) to study the impact of conservation areas designated in 1987 on new developments
- Automated news media fact-checking: scan and analyze web articles for developer names, planning permission dates, and locations to validate claims about high-profile projects (e.g., Harry Redknapp‚Äôs Pierfront Properties approval)
- Government transparency dashboards: aggregate and visualize planning application outcomes by date, developer, and city (such as Bournemouth in October 2019) to support public policy analysis and citizen engagement
- Legal property compliance monitoring: track the approval status of planning permissions for former homeless accommodations to ensure developers comply with council conditions and heritage requirements
- Tourism and cultural guide enrichment: verify the presence of specific landmarks and recent development changes (flats conversion, conservation areas) when generating up-to-date travel guides for Bournemouth‚Äôs seafront attractions
- Social impact assessment for NGOs: compile and analyze data on shelter-to-housing conversion projects approved in 2019 to report on local homelessness alleviation efforts and inform funding decisions
