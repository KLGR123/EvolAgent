# Planner Initialization

## Task
I’m thinking about selling my home, so I want to learn more about how homes in my area sold recently. I live in Pearl City, Hawaii, which is on the island of Oahu. I know two homes near me that sold in 2022 were 2072 Akaikai Loop, and 2017 Komo Mai Drive. Find which of those homes sold for more in 2022, and tell me how much it sold for. Don’t put commas or decimal places in the answer.

### List Pre-2020 US Zip Codes for Invasive Clownfish Sightings

**TASK**: I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.
