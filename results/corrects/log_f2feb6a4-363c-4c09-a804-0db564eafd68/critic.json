  "reason": "Task analysis: Find which of two Pearl City, Hawaii homes (2072 Akaikai Loop or 2017 Komo Mai Drive) sold for more in 2022 and provide the higher sale price without commas or decimals. All three members employed systematic web search approaches using real estate databases and public records. Member 1 evaluation: Found 2072 Akaikai Loop sold for $860,000 (Dec 14, 2022) and 2017 Komo Mai Drive sold for $900,000 (Aug 5, 2022), concluding 2017 Komo Mai Drive sold for more. Used multiple verification sources including Trulia, Sean Ginella Hawaii, Ocean Regroup, Coldwell Banker. Member 2 evaluation: Initially attempted web scraping but switched to Google Search API after technical failures. Found conflicting data claiming 2072 Akaikai Loop sold for $1,190,000 and 2017 Komo Mai Drive for $900,000, concluding Akaikai Loop sold for more. This represents a significant discrepancy from other members. Member 3 evaluation: Found identical results to Member 1 - 2072 Akaikai Loop at $860,000 and 2017 Komo Mai Drive at $900,000, with extensive verification across 6+ real estate sources including Zillow, Realtor.com, Trulia. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 1 and 3 on both properties' sale prices, while Member 2 shows significant divergence on Akaikai Loop pricing ($1,190,000 vs $860,000). Divergence resolution: Member 2's substantially higher figure for Akaikai Loop appears to be an outlier, possibly due to data extraction errors during the technical difficulties encountered. The consistency between Members 1 and 3, combined with their extensive source verification, provides higher confidence. Integration assessment: Members 1 and 3 demonstrate methodological soundness with cross-verification across multiple authoritative sources, while Member 2's technical issues may have compromised data accuracy. Final validation: 2017 Komo Mai Drive at $900,000 represents the consensus answer with highest reliability.",
