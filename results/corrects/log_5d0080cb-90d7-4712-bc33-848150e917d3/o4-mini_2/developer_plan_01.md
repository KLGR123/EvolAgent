# Developer Plan #1 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 5d0080cb-90d7-4712-bc33-848150e917d3  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-02 03:37:38

## Plan Content
```
Search for and download the University of Leicester paper titled "Can Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon’s Diet?" from the University of Leicester website or an academic repository to workspace/university_of_leicester_dragon_diet.pdf.
```

## Plan Description
```
This step is optimal because: (1) No prior document retrieval has been done, (2) The original paper must be obtained before identifying any data, (3) Expected outcome is a local PDF copy for analysis, (4) This directly advances toward finding the fish bag volume in m³ by enabling subsequent extraction of the required figure.

### Development Step 2: Locate Nedoshivina 2010 paper on Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov, including methods and repository info

**Description**: Search for Nedoshivina's 2010 scientific paper that includes descriptions of Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov. Focus on finding the complete publication with methods/materials sections or specimen repository information. Use these search approaches: (1) Academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or ResearchGate using keywords 'Nedoshivina 2010 Vietnamese specimens Kuznetzov', (2) Taxonomic databases that might reference specimen deposits, (3) Journal archives that published the paper in 2010. Look specifically for sections mentioning specimen deposition, museum collections, or institutional repositories where the Vietnamese materials were stored.

**Use Cases**:
- Museum curators automatically extracting specimen deposition details from Nedoshivina’s 2010 catalogue to update and verify their Tortricidae collection database at ZISP
- Biodiversity informaticians harvesting Vietnamese Tortricidae origin and repository metadata from published PDFs to integrate into a global species occurrence platform
- Academic researchers conducting a meta‐analysis of Tortricidae diversity by programmatically discovering, downloading, and parsing type specimen catalogues from online archives
- Digital librarians automating the discovery and archiving of obscure entomological publications in Atalanta to ensure complete institutional repository holdings
- Grant administrators monitoring open‐access compliance by locating and validating full‐text taxonomic papers in Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and journal archives
- Conservation biologists retrieving museum accession numbers and collection localities from PDF methods sections to model habitat suitability for endangered moth species
- Systematics PhD students streamlining their literature reviews by scraping abstracts, methods/materials, and repository information from historical taxonomic papers
- Data journalists investigating transparency in specimen reporting by aggregating repository details from multiple scientific databases into an interactive dashboard

### Development Step 1: Find Nedoshivina 2010 Publication Describing Kuznetzov’s Vietnamese Specimens, Including Methods and Repository Info

**Description**: Search for Nedoshivina's 2010 scientific paper that includes descriptions of Vietnamese specimens by Kuznetzov. Focus on finding the complete publication with methods/materials sections or specimen repository information. Use these search approaches: (1) Academic databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or ResearchGate using keywords 'Nedoshivina 2010 Vietnamese specimens Kuznetzov', (2) Taxonomic databases that might reference specimen deposits, (3) Journal archives that published the paper in 2010. Look specifically for sections mentioning specimen deposition, museum collections, or institutional repositories where the Vietnamese materials were stored.

**Use Cases**:
- Entomology researcher retrieving Nedoshivina’s 2010 paper to verify Vietnamese veneer moth specimen depositories before describing a new related species
- Museum curator cross-referencing taxonomic literature to confirm the institutional repository and accession numbers of Kuznetzov’s Vietnam collection for database curation
- Graduate student compiling methods and material details from primary sources to support a molecular phylogeny of Southeast Asian Tortricidae
- Biodiversity informatics specialist automating DOI and PDF link extraction for taxonomic publications to integrate specimen metadata into an online species portal
- Conservation biologist mapping historical specimen localities in Vietnam by extracting georeferenced collection data from Nedoshivina’s publication
- Journal editor validating author-provided repository statements against original publications to ensure compliance with taxonomic code requirements
- Natural history collection manager updating digital catalogs by linking specimen records to their original taxonomic descriptions and museum holdings
- Academic librarian indexing obscure entomological articles in digital archives, using SerpAPI to locate full-text PDFs and DOIs for 2010 publications

### Development Step 3: Confirm 2011 Extractive Metallurgy of Ni, Co, PGM Includes Lithium Calcination and Two-Stage Bioleaching

**Description**: Verify the identified 2011 Elsevier publication 'Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum-Group Metals' by conducting a targeted search to confirm it specifically covers both the calcination process with lithium salts for recovering metals from spent automotive catalysts AND the two-stage bioleaching method using Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for low-grade cobalt ores. Search for the book's table of contents, chapter summaries, or detailed reviews that explicitly mention these two specific processes. Cross-reference with academic databases, publisher catalogs, and technical literature citations to ensure this publication contains both required methodologies described in the TASK.

**Use Cases**:
- Patent due diligence for materials science: verifying that a 2022 WO patent application covers both reinforced polymer composites and flame-retardant additive processing steps by targeted SerpAPI queries to patent office and scholarly sources
- Pharmaceutical guideline confirmation: ensuring the 2020 WHO monograph explicitly includes renal dosage adjustment protocols and adverse reaction monitoring procedures by searching chapter summaries and section titles
- Automotive supplier audit: confirming an ISO/TS 16949 supplier manual online covers both heat-treatment procedures for chassis parts and corrosion-resistance testing protocols using focused Google searches
- Open-source software compliance check: verifying that a cryptography library’s documentation details both RSA key generation methods and AES-GCM encryption usage via structured search queries on GitHub Pages and developer blogs
- Market intelligence white-paper analysis: ensuring a competitor’s 2021 market study contains consumer behavior segmentation for North America and side-by-side feature comparisons with key rivals by scanning executive summaries and table of contents
- Academic textbook syllabus alignment: confirming a 2023 engineering thermodynamics textbook includes both entropy analysis chapters and exergy efficiency case studies as mandated by a university course outline
- GDPR compliance verification: checking that the EU’s official GDPR guidelines PDF addresses both data subject access rights and data breach notification requirements by targeted searches of section headings and legal commentary
- Environmental impact report validation: verifying that a 2019 EPA assessment document covers both greenhouse gas emission quantification methods and carbon capture technology evaluations through focused online catalog and summary searches

In the first search (#1) you found the direct PDF download link “https://journals.le.ac.uk/index.php/jist/article/download/733/684/1496” among the 8 unique URLs. This means you’ve located the PDF endpoint (≈80% of the PLAN), but you haven’t yet implemented the download step in this iteration. Next steps: \n1. Add a download routine that takes that URL, issues requests.get(url, stream=True), checks for a 200 status and Content-Type: application/pdf, then writes the chunks to workspace/university_of_leicester_dragon_diet.pdf. \n2. After saving, verify the file size (>10 KB) and optionally open it to confirm it’s a valid PDF. \n3. Once confirmed, you will have fully met the PLAN objective of saving the paper to workspace/university_of_leicester_dragon_diet.pdf.',
