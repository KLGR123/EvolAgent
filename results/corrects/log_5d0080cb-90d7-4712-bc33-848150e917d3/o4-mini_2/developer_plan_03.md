# Developer Plan #3 - o4-mini

**Task ID:** 5d0080cb-90d7-4712-bc33-848150e917d3  
**Model:** o4-mini  
**Plan Index:** 3  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-02 03:55:49

## Plan Content
```
Read the file extracted_fish_bag_volume.txt in the same workspace directory that contains university_of_leicester_dragon_diet.pdf and output its contents to identify the fish bag volume in m^3.
```

## Plan Description
```
This plan is optimal because the developer has already extracted the fish bag volume(s) into extracted_fish_bag_volume.txt; reading this file will directly reveal the numerical volume value needed to answer the TASK question without reprocessing the PDF.

### Development Step 4: Extract Rick Riordan Titles and Unavailable Status from Scribe County Library PDF

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/e9a2c537-8232-4c3f-85b0-b52de6bcba99.pdf to extract the complete book collection data from Scribe County Public Library. Identify all books authored by Rick Riordan in the collection, then determine their current availability status by checking which ones are marked as checked out, on hold, or otherwise not currently available on the library shelves. Calculate the total count of Rick Riordan books that are not physically present on the shelves.

**Use Cases**:
- Public library inventory management and real-time availability tracking for librarians
- School district resource planning and automated hold request alerts for media specialists
- Bookstore restocking optimization and vendor catalog PDF ingestion for retail managers
- University library audit and missing-volume reconciliation using extracted shelf-status data
- Digital humanities research on author publication patterns via automated PDF catalog parsing
- Educational compliance reporting and overdue item summaries for school administrators
- Personalized reading recommendation systems by analyzing student checkout histories
- Public sector transparency dashboards and borrowing statistics generation from library documents

### Development Step 1: Extract Fast-Food Chain Sales by City; Compare Wharvton and Algrimand Totals

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached Excel file data/gaia/2023/validation/7cc4acfa-63fd-4acc-a1a1-e8e529e0a97f.xlsx to extract all sales data for the regional fast-food chain menu items by city location. Identify the data structure including column headers and city organization, then calculate the total sales for Wharvton and Algrimand specifically to determine which city had greater total sales.

**Use Cases**:
- Automated regional franchise performance monitoring by extracting monthly sales of burgers, fries, and drinks in Wharvton and Algrimand to generate city-level revenue comparisons for management dashboards
- Inventory restocking optimization by parsing daily Excel sales reports from each location and calculating turnover rates to trigger automated supply orders in high-demand cities
- Marketing campaign ROI evaluation by analyzing pre- and post-promotion menu item sales in Wharvton and Algrimand to quantify the impact of targeted advertising efforts
- Financial audit compliance checks by aggregating city-level sales data across multiple workbooks and reconciling reported totals for Wharvton and Algrimand against corporate ledgers
- Menu engineering insights by summarizing item-level performance in Algrimand and Wharvton to identify top-selling sandwiches and salads for recipe refinement and upsell strategies
- Franchise expansion feasibility study by comparing year-to-date sales metrics between Wharvton and Algrimand to evaluate potential profitability of a new nearby outlet
- Supply chain risk monitoring by detecting sudden drops in weekly sales for Wharvton and Algrimand to proactively reroute distributions during logistical disruptions
- Public health research support by providing consumption statistics of fast-food menu items from Wharvton and Algrimand to academic studies on regional dietary patterns

### Development Step 3: Extract and Count Unavailable Rick Riordan Books from Scribe County Public Library PDF

**Description**: Parse and analyze the attached PDF file data/gaia/2023/validation/e9a2c537-8232-4c3f-85b0-b52de6bcba99.pdf to extract the complete book collection data from Scribe County Public Library. Identify all books authored by Rick Riordan in the collection, then determine their current availability status by checking which ones are marked as checked out, on hold, or otherwise not currently available on the library shelves. Calculate the total count of Rick Riordan books that are not physically present on the shelves.

**Use Cases**:
- Public library circulation monitoring: Librarians automatically parse PDF inventories to identify which Rick Riordan titles are checked out or overdue, enabling timely replacement orders and shelf restocking.
- School reading program scheduling: School librarians extract author-specific availability from PDF catalogs to confirm that every required Rick Riordan book is on-shelf before semester reading assignments.
- Book fair event planning: Community event coordinators analyze library availability reports to secure and order Rick Riordan books for author signings and youth reading festivals.
- Publisher demand forecasting: Rick Riordan’s publishing team processes library holding data to measure regional check-out rates and optimize print run volumes and distribution strategies.
- Academic literary research: Researchers aggregate public library PDF collections across districts to study circulation trends of Rick Riordan’s works in middle grade and young adult literature studies.
- Automated reporting for library consortiums: Library IT departments integrate PDF parsing scripts into their management systems to generate real-time alerts on high-demand authors like Rick Riordan.
- Retail book supplier stock replenishment: Book distributors use library availability extraction to plan bulk shipments of out-of-shelf Rick Riordan titles to independent bookstores and school suppliers.
- Digital transformation in library services: Library operations automate converting scanned PDF catalogs into JSON and text reports, streamlining integration of Rick Riordan availability data into mobile apps and online catalogs.
