## Final Answer
```
Harbinger, Tidal
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Identify pre-1999 Fiona Apple and Paula Cole albums that did NOT receive letter grades from Robert Christgau, formatted as alphabetized comma-delimited list. All members correctly identified the three target albums: Fiona Apple's 'Tidal' (1996), Paula Cole's 'Harbinger' (1994), and Paula Cole's 'This Fire' (1996). However, critical divergences emerged in Christgau review findings. Member 1 found 'Tidal' received grade 'e' and 'This Fire' received grade 'B', with 'Harbinger' not found, concluding only 'Harbinger' lacked a grade. Member 2 found 'Tidal' received 'Neither' rating (not a letter grade), 'This Fire' received 'C+' grade, and 'Harbinger' was not reviewed, concluding both 'Harbinger' and 'Tidal' lacked letter grades. Member 3 claimed all albums received letter grades ('Tidal': A, 'Harbinger': d, 'This Fire': C+), concluding no albums lacked grades. Cross-analysis reveals Member 2's approach demonstrates superior methodological rigor by distinguishing between Christgau's letter grade system (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, etc.) versus special ratings like 'Neither' icons. Member 2's finding that 'Tidal' received a 'Neither' rating rather than a letter grade shows more precise understanding of Christgau's Consumer Guide methodology. Member 1's grade 'e' appears questionable as this is not part of Christgau's standard grading system. Member 3's claims of finding grades for all albums contradicts the other members' systematic research. Synthesis evaluation: Member 2's distinction between letter grades and special ratings is most accurate to Christgau's actual review system. Final validation: 'Harbinger' (not reviewed) and 'Tidal' (received 'Neither' rating, not letter grade) are the albums lacking letter grades.
