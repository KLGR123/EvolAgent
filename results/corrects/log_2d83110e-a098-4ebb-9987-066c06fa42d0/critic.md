## Final Answer
```
right
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: The given sentence '.rewsna eht sa "tfel" drow eht fo etisoppo eht etirw ,ecnetnes siht dnatsrednu uoy fI' requires decoding through character reversal to reveal the instruction 'If you understand this sentence, write the opposite of the word "left" as the answer.' Individual evaluation: Member 1 demonstrated comprehensive analytical methodology with systematic planning, implementation, and verification phases - correctly identified the reversal encoding, decoded the message, and determined 'right' as the opposite of 'left' with detailed documentation and workspace output. Member 2 provided concise but accurate analysis, correctly decoding the sentence and identifying 'right' as the answer with efficient problem-solving approach. Member 3 showed solid understanding of the reversal technique, properly decoded the sentence, and arrived at correct answer 'right' with clear explanatory reasoning. Cross-analysis reveals perfect convergence: all members successfully decoded the reversed sentence and unanimously concluded 'right' as the opposite of 'left'. No contradictions exist between approaches. Synthesis evaluation: While all members reached the correct conclusion, Member 1's approach demonstrated superior methodological rigor through systematic planning, comprehensive implementation with verification steps, and detailed documentation practices. The multi-phase approach (planner-developer-planner cycle) with workspace output and thorough analysis represents best practices for complex problem-solving tasks. Final validation confirms 'right' as definitively correct answer with high confidence level.
