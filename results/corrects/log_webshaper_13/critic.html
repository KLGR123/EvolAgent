                Task analysis: Identify the total number of fighters killed from the Polish resistance group involved in a specific July 1943 skirmish near Bielsk County that resulted in 25 Polish and 40 German deaths. All three members conducted systematic historical research and reached convergent conclusions. Member evaluation: (1) Member 0 provided comprehensive research methodology with casualty range of 40,000-80,000 AK fighters, including detailed breakdown by operations and conservative vs. higher estimates, (2) Member 1 used systematic likelihood scoring analysis and identified approximately 34,000 Armia Krajowa deaths with strong methodological rigor, (3) Member 2 employed historical knowledge synthesis with 80-85% confidence assessment, concluding 34,000-50,000 AK casualties. Cross-analysis reveals unanimous identification of Armia Krajowa (Home Army) as the resistance group involved, with strong convergence on organizational presence in northeastern Poland and operational capability. Divergence examination shows variation in casualty estimates: Member 0's 40,000-80,000 represents broader historical range including all AK losses, while Members 1 and 2 converge on 34,000-50,000 range with more focused analysis. Synthesis evaluation: Member 1's systematic scoring methodology (8/8 likelihood score) combined with Member 2's confidence assessment (80-85%) provides most rigorous analytical framework. The 34,000 figure represents the lower bound of the most frequently cited range and appears in multiple independent analyses. Final validation: All members demonstrate strong historical knowledge and methodological soundness, with Member 1 providing most systematic analytical approach and precise numerical conclusion.
