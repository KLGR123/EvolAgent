## Final Answer
```
cloak
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Fact-check a citation by verifying if quoted text matches the original source article. The task requires accessing David Greetham's 'Uncoupled: OR, How I Lost My Author(s)' from Textual Cultures journal (2008) and comparing the quoted passage with the actual text. All three members demonstrated excellent methodological approaches: (1) Member 1 successfully resolved DOI 10.2979/tex.2008.3.1.44, accessed the article via Project MUSE, extracted full text, and identified the discrepancy between 'cloak of print' (citation) vs 'veil of print' (actual text), (2) Member 2 employed comprehensive multi-source search strategy, successfully downloaded the PDF, performed detailed word-by-word comparison, and identified two discrepancies: 'obscured' vs 'scured' and 'cloak' vs 'veil', (3) Member 3 used systematic search methodology, successfully accessed the article, extracted text from all 13 pages, and confirmed the 'cloak' vs 'veil' discrepancy through precise textual analysis. Convergence analysis: All members reached identical conclusions regarding the primary discrepancy - the citation incorrectly uses 'cloak of print' while the actual article text uses 'veil of print'. Cross-validation: Multiple independent verifications confirm the same error. Integration assessment: The evidence is overwhelming and consistent across all approaches. Final validation: The quoted text does not match exactly due to the word substitution. Answer format compliance: Task requests the specific mismatched word without articles, which is 'cloak'.
