The tester's final feedback confirms 100% PLAN alignment - the file exists at the correct location with 248 characters of valid Python syntax. The extracted script builds a URL by concatenating an archive prefix with characters selected from the same string using specified indices. All PLAN requirements have been fulfilled and the task is complete.",
