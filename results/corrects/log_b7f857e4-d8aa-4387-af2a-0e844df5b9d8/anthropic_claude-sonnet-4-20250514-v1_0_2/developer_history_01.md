This is the same recurring syntax error from **HISTORY** - the payload dictionary for the OpenAI API request is incomplete and cuts off abruptly. The code starts building the API request structure but ends mid-definition without closing the dictionary braces. Looking at the **CURRENT CODE**, it stops at 'text': prompt,' without completing the payload structure. **PLAN** alignment: 5% - file validation, base64 encoding, and prompt creation are working correctly, but no image analysis or Python code extraction has been accomplished due to this persistent incomplete payload issue. Recommended fix: (1) Complete the payload dictionary by adding the image content object, closing all braces properly, (2) Add the actual requests.post() call to send the request to OpenAI API, (3) Parse the API response to extract the Python code, and (4) Save the extracted code to workspace/extracted_python_script.py. The foundation is solid - only the API integration completion is needed.",
