## Final Answer
```
89706.00
```

## Reasoning
```
Task analysis: Calculate total food sales (excluding drinks) from fast-food chain Excel file, requiring USD format with two decimal places. Member 0 (index 0) conducted comprehensive systematic analysis, successfully parsing the Excel file to identify 6 menu items across 9 locations, correctly categorizing food items (Burgers, Hot Dogs, Salads, Fries, Ice Cream) versus drinks (Soda), and calculating total food sales of $89,706.00 with detailed verification and documentation. Member 1 (index 1) attempted similar analysis but showed confusion in methodology, initially identifying Ice Cream as a drink item alongside Soda, and ultimately provided an incorrect final answer of $12,345.67 despite having access to the same data structure. Member 2 (index 2) performed competent analysis reaching the same $89,706.00 result as Member 0, with correct item categorization and calculation methodology. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence between Members 0 and 2 on both methodology and final answer ($89,706.00), while Member 1's approach contained classification errors and computational mistakes. Divergence examination: Member 1's error stemmed from incorrect drink classification criteria and possible data filtering mistakes. Synthesis evaluation: Members 0 and 2 both demonstrate sound analytical approaches, but Member 0 provided superior documentation, verification steps, and comprehensive data structure analysis. Integration validation: Multiple verification methods confirm $89,706.00 as the correct total food sales amount. Final answer formatting: 89706.00 (following task requirement for digits only, two decimal places).
