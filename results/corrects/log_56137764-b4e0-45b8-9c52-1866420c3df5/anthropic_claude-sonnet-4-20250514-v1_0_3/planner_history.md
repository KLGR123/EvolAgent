    "plan": 'Research when Mask-RCNN model support was added to OpenCV by searching for OpenCV release notes, changelogs, GitHub commits, and documentation related to Mask-RCNN implementation. Focus on identifying the specific OpenCV version that introduced Mask-RCNN support and gather information about the contributors, developers, or authors involved in implementing this feature. Look for official OpenCV documentation, GitHub repository history, and release announcements that mention Mask-RCNN functionality.',
    "description": 'This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to identify the specific OpenCV version that added Mask-RCNN support before we can find contributors, (2) No previous research has been conducted yet, (3) Expected outcome is to determine when Mask-RCNN was integrated into OpenCV and identify preliminary contributor information, (4) This directly addresses the first part of the TASK requirement to find the relevant OpenCV version and its contributors',

    "description": 'The research objective has been fully completed successfully. Based on the comprehensive analysis shown in the HISTORY, the cross-reference research between OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors and Chinese government leaders has been definitively completed with extensive supporting evidence:\n\n**RESEARCH COMPLETED:**\n- **Objective**: Cross-reference OpenCV Mask-RCNN implementation contributors with transliterated Chinese government leader names\n- **Contributors Identified**: 11 total contributors including Dmitry Kurtaev (primary implementer), Alexander Alekhin, YashasSamaga, HAN Liutong, Andrew Ryrie, and others\n- **Chinese Leaders Database**: 67 leaders from various eras (PRC, ROC, Qing Dynasty, Ming Dynasty)\n- **Transliteration Analysis**: 1,877 transliteration variations generated using multiple romanization systems\n- **Cross-Reference Result**: NO MATCHES FOUND\n\n**KEY FINDINGS:**\n1. **OpenCV Contributors (11 total)**:\n   - Dmitry Kurtaev (primary implementer)\n   - Alexander Alekhin (code reviewer/merger)\n   - YashasSamaga, HAN Liutong, Andrew Ryrie, GitHub, alalek, dkurt, hanliutong, smbz, web-flow\n\n2. **Chinese Leaders Analyzed (67 total)**:\n   - Modern PRC: Mao Zedong, Xi Jinping, Hu Jintao, Jiang Zemin, Zhou Enlai, Li Keqiang, etc.\n   - ROC Era: Sun Yat-sen, Yuan Shikai, Chiang Kai-shek, etc.\n   - Imperial Era: Qing emperors (Kangxi, Qianlong, etc.), Ming emperors (Hongwu, Yongle, etc.)\n\n3. **Transliteration Methodology**:\n   - Multiple romanization systems (Wade-Giles, Pinyin)\n   - Name order variations (given-family vs family-given)\n   - Spelling variations and phonetic alternatives\n   - Hyphenation and spacing variations\n\n**DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION:**\nNo OpenCV Mask-RCNN contributors match transliterated names of Chinese government leaders from any historical period.
