  "reason": "Task analysis: Determine which city (Wharvton or Algrimand) had greater total sales based on data in the provided Excel file. All three team members approached the task methodically by: (1) Parsing the Excel file to understand its structure, (2) Extracting sales data specific to Wharvton and Algrimand, (3) Calculating total sales across all menu items for each city, and (4) Comparing the totals to determine the city with greater sales. Member 1 identified the spreadsheet structure with 9 cities and 7 columns (Location + 6 menu items) and calculated Wharvton's total as $12,055 and Algrimand's as $11,907. Member 2 performed similar analysis, explicitly listing the menu categories (Burgers, Hot Dogs, Salads, Fries, Ice Cream, Soda) and reached identical totals: Wharvton ($12,055) and Algrimand ($11,907). Member 3 also confirmed the same structure and totals. Cross-analysis shows perfect convergence on the final answer with all members reporting Wharvton had greater total sales by exactly $148. There are no contradictions in methodology or results across all three analyses. The consistent findings across different team members using independent approaches provides high confidence in the answer. Final validation confirms Wharvton ($12,055) had greater total sales than Algrimand ($11,907).",
