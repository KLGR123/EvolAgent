# Developer Plan #1 - anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0

**Task ID:** 7  
**Model:** anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0  
**Plan Index:** 1  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-30 19:08:55

## Plan Content
```
Conduct a comprehensive web search to identify the developer of tradition-based narrative ethics whose theories are applied in 'Studies in War, Business, and Environmental Ethics'. Search for this specific book title along with keywords like 'tradition-based narrative ethics', 'business ethics case studies', and 'narrative ethics theory'. Extract information about the book's theoretical framework, cited philosophers, and the specific tradition-based narrative ethics theorist whose work forms the foundation for the business ethics analysis.
```

## Plan Description
```
This is the optimal starting approach because: (1) We need to establish the chain of connections starting with the known book title, (2) No previous research has been conducted, (3) Expected outcome is to identify the key philosopher/theorist behind tradition-based narrative ethics, (4) This creates the foundation for finding the subsequent work about fractured tradition in medicine that applies the same theoretical framework

This clearly identifies Josiah Royce as the tradition-based narrative ethics theorist. Now I'm conducting a second targeted search specifically for 'Josiah Royce narrative ethics tradition-based business' to gather more detailed information about Royce's theoretical framework and how his narrative ethics theories are applied to business ethics. This will help us understand the specific philosophical foundations and methodologies used in the dissertation.",

    "description": "Conducting the final targeted search for 'Josiah Royce loyalty ethics business applications' to gather more specific information about how Royce's theories apply to business contexts, then compiling comprehensive findings from all three searches. This search focuses on Royce's loyalty ethics since previous results indicated this is a central concept in his philosophy. After the search, I'm creating a complete summary that answers the research question definitively: Josiah Royce (1855-1916) is the developer of tradition-based narrative ethics whose theories are applied in Bell's dissertation. The comprehensive findings document will include all key details about the book (actually a PhD dissertation by Jason Matthew Bell from Vanderbilt University, 2009), Royce's philosophical background as a leading American absolute idealist, and his theoretical contributions including loyalty ethics, applied ethics, and community-based moral reasoning. This compilation provides the complete answer to the PLAN's research objective.",
