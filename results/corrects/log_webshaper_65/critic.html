                Task analysis: Identify duchies placed under direct imperial control by the emperor who commissioned the first cathedral with encircling galleries, after confiscating them from a German antiking and a ruler with abbey advocacy rights. Member evaluation reveals significant convergence and divergence: Member 1 identified Henry IV as the emperor (Speyer Cathedral expansion ~1090) with comprehensive evidence of duchy confiscations from antiking Rudolf of Rheinfelden (Swabia) and Otto of Nordheim who held advocacy rights over Gandersheim Abbey (Bavaria, plus Carinthia, Lorraine, Franconia, Saxon duchies). Member 2 reached identical conclusions through independent research, confirming Henry IV's Speyer Cathedral project and the same duchy confiscations (Swabia, Bavaria, Carinthia, Franconia, Saxon duchies) with strong supporting evidence. Member 3 incorrectly identified Conrad II as the emperor based on Speyer Cathedral's initial construction (1030) rather than Henry IV's later expansion featuring the encircling galleries, leading to analysis of Ernest II's rebellion and only the Duchy of Swabia confiscation. Cross-analysis shows Members 1 and 2 demonstrate superior historical accuracy by distinguishing between Conrad II's original cathedral construction and Henry IV's subsequent expansion that added the distinctive encircling gallery feature. Both correctly identified the Investiture Controversy context, Rudolf of Rheinfelden as the German antiking, and Gandersheim Abbey as the disputed territory. Synthesis evaluation: Members 1 and 2 provide mutually reinforcing evidence with identical core findings and complementary research depth. The convergence on Henry IV, the specific historical conflicts, and the primary duchies (Swabia, Bavaria, Carinthia, Lorraine) represents the most methodologically sound and historically accurate analysis. Final validation confirms these four duchies as definitively placed under Henry IV's direct imperial control through the described confiscations.
