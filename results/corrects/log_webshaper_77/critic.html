                Task analysis: Identify the death year of an English politician and Justice of the Peace who prosecuted William Shakespeare's father in a 1570 illegal wool trading case, with shared heraldic symbols between families. All three members conducted systematic research and reached convergent identification of Sir Thomas Lucy as the prosecutor. Member evaluation: Member 1 demonstrated exceptional methodological rigor with comprehensive search strategies, proper evidence validation (116-point scoring system), and thorough heraldic analysis identifying silver/argent as the shared symbol between Lucy ('Argent, three luces hauriant gules') and Shakespeare ('Or, on a bend sable, a spear of the first steeled argent') coats of arms, concluding with death year 1600. Member 2 employed solid research methodology with 33 relevant findings and 18-point relevance scoring for Lucy identification, but contained a critical factual error claiming Lucy died in 1551, contradicting well-documented historical records. Member 3 used systematic approach with strong academic sourcing (JSTOR, Wikipedia) and proper jurisdictional analysis, correctly identifying Lucy's death as July 7, 1600, with comprehensive biographical verification. Cross-analysis reveals strong convergence on Sir Thomas Lucy identification and heraldic connections, but significant divergence on death year (Members 1&3: 1600 vs Member 2: 1551). Evidence evaluation strongly supports 1600 through multiple authoritative sources including Wikipedia biographical entries and historical records. Member 2's 1551 date appears to be a research error, as Sir Thomas Lucy (1532-1600) is well-documented in historical literature. Final validation confirms 1600 as the definitive answer with high confidence based on scholarly consensus.
